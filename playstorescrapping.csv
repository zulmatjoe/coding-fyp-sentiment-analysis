"With the new update, I also lost the ability to send gallery photos from within the app, as other users have said. It took me a long time to figure out how to fix it. The other problem I have had for years is: When I am listening to a voice recording and something accidentally covers my phone's light sensor, my screen automatically goes black and the message stops playing. It takes several steps to start the message again, and there is no setting to fix it! It drives me crazy!"
"I like this app. Most of my friend and family groups have just migrated to it because of the ease that voice notes and video chat provide. That said, I wish there was an option to limit the picture and video auto-download by individual/group chat and not for the whole app. I have some chats where I like keeping pics, but others, not so much, so the fact that I have to go into my folders to manually delete is a bit annoying. That's why I took away a star. Otherwise, it's a pretty good app."
"Great when it decides to work. Half of my messages take all day to send out most of the time. And out of nowhere, every call I have ends up ""Reconnecting"" and then getting dropped. My video calls don't work anymore. Since the update, it's become more difficult to communicate with people by just using this app."
"loved it but within the past update or two I've been so frustrated with the light sensor changing the way the msgs can be heard. I'll try to listen and it keeps stopping no matter what i try.. seems so random, I don't know why it works or doesn't work at any given time, and now I'm trying to listen to a msg on my headphones and it switches to speaker whenever i put the phone in my pocket. i do not want to have to hold the phone to hear everything, and even when i do, it doesn't play sometimes!"
"On Samsung devices, there's been a new update that's come through and WhatsApp images do not show the latest image that has been taken, for example like a screenshot that you just took will not be available in the gallery unless you go through and click the three dots and then select the photo. And even when you do that you can always select one photo at a time. Previously all photos would be available even ones that you just took. Please fix this so I can give you a five-star review."
"As others have stated, this latest release makes sharing photos from the gallery very difficult, you can't send multiple photos at once any more, and you can't write captions anymore. this problem cannot be resolved as it's to do with how whatsapp accesses media from your phone. Utter garbage, this used to be a great app, now it's practically useless."
"It's a good app and it does the job but changing from one phone to another is a total nightmare and nobody seems to be able to explain how to do it. The web instructions are confusing and wrong, the independent websites are confusing and wrong, and I just want to transfer everything, including chats, from an old phone and number to a new phone and number. I feel like it would be easier to build a faster than light spaceship and I also feel like it's a lot harder than it absolutely has to be"
"New update sucks - please revert photo sharing features to how it worked before. Now, instead of seeing my photos to send, I see photos I've already sent. I don't want that. Also, once I found the secret photo menu, I can only select one photo at a time. Sux sux sux - I get it - you don't want us to use your storage. Don't care. Incentive us another way. Please fix photo sharing."
"Fingerprint Lock not Working. I just got a new Pixel 7 Pro and when I switched phones, the app is not maintaining the ""fingerprint lock"" setting It only works randomly. Sometimes I open the app, it doesn't ask for a fingerprint and other times it does even though the setting is enabled. I have deleted and redownloaded the app, cleared the cache, disabled and reenabled the setting again, nothing has worked to make it prompt me every time for a fingerprint."
My earbuds (Tozo T9) don't work in calls AT ALL anymore but work perfectly fine in every other app on my phone which is super annoying because my current phone doesn't have a headphone jack so I'm stuck either being on calls with them on speaker or holding up my phone all the time. Additionally the new update makes sending photos a nightmare with all the additional clicks you have to go through.. only to be able to send one photo at a time 🙃
"I'd give more than 2 stars if I could reach someone to resolve issue. Whenever I attempt to attach photos/video from gallery, it wont allow me to select them. Of course, I also have to select Gallery from the 3 buttons on the right, but regardless, I cannot select and send. This is very frustrating as I use this for work and used to be able to do this with captions for each pic. Now I have to attach, write caption, send and do it again (from another app!)"
"The Notification feature was eliminated from the Android version, iPhone still has this feature. This is why I give them 1 star, I wish I could give it 0 stars. Instead of improving it they made it worse!!! Terrible sound quality, the sound cuts in and out often to the point where you just hangup."
"Was good. But the latest update doesn't allow you to select multiple pictures to send, you have to send one at a time. It now also requires multiple steps to get to your album just to be able to share pics. So you have to go through multiple steps to get to your gallery (which wasn't intuitive after years of using it) and you can only select 1 pic at a time....."
Can't give this app more than a 3. It's definitely meant for transitory experiences and not keeping things longer term. You can export but not import chat histories. Restore from local database doesn't work. No way to keep messages if you somehow end up with them on multiple phones from say using a new number without merging accounts immediately. Sad situation for ppl who like memories. I would recommend Telegram or some other messaging app
"Since the last update, like everyone else mentioned, I can't send photos directly from the app. It takes forever for the photos to actually show up when I try to find it thru the app. No matter if it's a photo I just took or a screen capture. Also, when I try to change my whatsapp wallpaper, it limits the folder that I can choose from. So not quite exactly all of ""my photos."" Not even when I screenshot it and hoping it would show up as ""my photos"", nope."
"Image attachments have stopped working. You can no longer type a message and insert an image. It has to be two separate messages. It also opens up a different gallery view to the normal one, meaning that you can only see the images already in what's app. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it is still not working. Please can this be resolved ASAP. OK, I've looked into this and there is an app called Telegram. It solves all of the problems above."
"The worst app I've ever used. Chat backup works terrible and there seems not to be any intention to improve it. The process to add stickers is archaic. Incredible that in 2022 it doesn't have a function to send a message at a specific time or even to play a voice message with the screen turned off! Not even a thing is good in this app, the best word to describe it is DISASTER."
"Sending images is such a hassle after the update... now when you want to attach an image you can only view images that you have received on WhatsApp. You have to take extra steps to browse through your gallery to send an image from your gallery as an attachment which is okay, but you can't select multiple images?! I can't imagine why you've done this. It is unbelievably frustrating!!!!!"
"It is one of the best app for free messaging, video and voice calls. It also have group and community features which are also best for sending messages to many people at same time. Although the calling function does not works at Saudi Arabia so if the developer can fix it it would be great. As well as, there is no the ads. Moreover, we can change theme, chat wallpaper and the new avatar feature is also great."
"After the latest update, I am having problem while viewing videos. The volume control does not stay fixed. It keeps coming to zero while viewing the videos. The same thing happens during video calls. Often the volume control panel remains on the left side of the screen. This is a terrible situation as I don't know how to remove the latest update. Please rectify the problem speedily through another update. Thanks."
"I'm having a problem with optimisation and syncing. Messages' notifications reaches hours and hours later. Yesterday evenings messages' notifications arrived today morning. Until the last few days, I hadn't seen a problem like this before. Receiving messages and their notifications is a basic function of a messaging app, and it should be. If this won't happen in WhatsApp, then why would I use it? Please, solve this problem. Because it's quite frustrating, disrupting and annoying."
"love this app. Lately tho it has become very unstable. Notifications not coming thru the way they used to. The delivery ticks aren't turning blue when other party has read the message. This is only sporadic not constant. But still...can something be done? This has started just a few months ago, before the most recent playstore update (which didn't fix the instability)"
"Had a great experience so far ... However, after the recent update, > Whattsapp calls are taking way too long to connect. ( Both incoming and outgoing ). Haven't checked on video calls though.. > Messaging is working pretty fine. > Also ..while trying to attach a image from within the chat window, ( especially which has been taken as a screenshot ) .. it isn't able to locate the image. Have to go to the gallery and use the Share option on the image. I am using a OnePlus 10 pro"
Since the last update the app does not allow you to send multiple photos. You have to send them one at a time which is frustrating and on top of that you no longer have access to your camera gallery. You have to go through multiple stupid annoying steps to try to find the camera pictures to send 1 by 1. This app has changed for the worse. It is now useless and garbage. Very disappointing
"The app used to be great, now they've changed the way the app orders it's messages, ie if you delete messages from a conversion, the conversation still stays at the top of the list where it used to fall back down the list to the relevant date order of the last message, this is really frustrating. Would be good to revert it to his out used to be, or give users the option in settings."
"Not entirely sure what they've done in the most recent update, but I now can't select a picture from my standard photo gallery without digging into the three dot menu. Also when sending a picture, I write text to describe it and that vanishes and only the picture gets sent and I then have to re-type the message. Clearly no quality control going on!"
"Terrible Update, User Experience Sucks! I am a very early user of this app and have seen it change and grow over the years but the most recent update has removed all the functionality that make it better than your standard SMS. As others have mentioned, sending photos now is a tedious process of multiple screens and menus. Also, pictures sent through this app no longer appear in the phones gallery ANYWHERE. The old WhatsApp folders for images and videos no longer populate. Absolute garbage."
"No longer able to select more than one image to send in one go, have to select one, send, then go back digging for the photos folder to select another.this is another frustrating bit, photos folder is no longer set up as default. You have to search it through three dots at the top. I choose Facebook Messenger more often for these reasons , I think I'll delete the app if this does not get sorted"
"I've always loved whatsapp. Number 1 app for fast clear communication. The Internet is not always the best on calls but it has improved immensely over the years. If I was to add a suggestion though I think it would be awesome to have display pictures that loop, and also its really annoying having to keep adjusting photos to fit into the box & when it does the image comes out blurry. Please fix so we can upload photos with larger size dimensions. I hope someone gets to see this as its a good idea"
"After the recent update I am not able to view the photos which are set to view only once. In addition to that I am not able to backup my chats to Google drive. It always stops at 96%, even though there is enough space on my drive. The customer support just sends automated messages and is of no help. Really disappointed with the customer support"
Brilliant. Use it every day and it works for me and all my friends. There is a lot of privacy you have and even WhatsApp cannot read the messages you send. If you want more privacy on chats and etc you can definitely change the settings easily. WhatsApp is good at sending photos and unlike Snapchat the messages and photos you send do not dissappear so you can go back and read or look at old things. I think it really is a great messaging app. There are also no ads!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"The app has improved a lot But the backup is very messy. Takes up the entire bandwidth for the backup and WiFi is pretty much unusable for anything else when the backup is uploading. Wouldn't have minded if a specific time could be selected to do the upload, we can't select a time for the backup to upload. The backup would be ""created"" during inactive hours but won't get ""uploaded"" until I wake up and try to use the phone. Then WiFi is unusable every morning after waking up. Frustrating at times"
"What have you done in the last update? I can no longer have samsung gallery as the default gallery. I have to go through multiple menus to get to the gallery. Then, I can only select one image at a time. If I write text then go to attach an image then all my text dissapears. This is very frustrating! Tried uninstalling and reinstalling WhatsApp. All permissions allowed. Samsung S22 ultra, latest software, all updates Can you please fix this!"
"It's a great chatting app/texting app however, I hate the fact that photos are saved automatically to the gallery on my phone. Please just keep photos and videos that are sent back and fourth to each chat just in the chat and not saved anywhere else. These extra memes/photos I have on my gallery are making the memory on my phone become extremely full and it's unnecessary. A literal waste of space. Thank you."
"Seems like im experiencing the same issue as others.... I used to be able to send multiple images directly from the paper clip option but like others, I now have to click the 3 dots then select gallery to then only be able to select ONE image at a time, then repeat the process if I want to send multiple images, which is not great user experience at all! Genuinely for the first time looking up other messaging platforms as this is just ridiculous. 2nd Jan 2023 - what is going on WhatsApp!?"
"Restoration of the backup process is full of glitches which can easily cause you to lose access to all your backed up chats, media, etc. Customer care is non existent when it comes to any solving issues. Automated messages are the most you can get out of them. For such a widely used app, this is extremely frustrating and disappointing."
"Hi, I'm gonna get into it real quick. I kinda find the app has lost one practical option... I can't send pictures that belong to my camera's album directely from the app. Now, I have to go to Gallery and choose pictures to send, which is not fast and practical as it was before. I hope we can get that option back. Thank you in advance."
"The basic messaging app is perfect. The need to be seen always evolving it adds complexity, especially to more vulnerable users. ""Reacted to"" feature should at least come up as a notification otherwise the recipient never knows they got a response. ""Show once"" image option for a few sending explicit images adds complexity for all. Data cleanup should be better including the ability to delete all the media I've sent for each contact as by definition I already have this media stored on my device"
"This app is terrible, firstly I can't send long videos to my contacts especially when it's something important. It only takes half of my video and sends it to the contact and I can't download a video that is long, like seriously, what if its something important I need to see. Secondly, when I send a message, it takes a very long time before it goes. It also takes a very long time before I receive messages. I also have a lot of issues to talk about but I can't cuz the limits 500 words. Stupid app"
"Believe me this application is wonderful regarding communication. Send message at anytime of the day, it will reach the addressee at any time and place across the Country and Continent.. Is this not marvelous? It is better than Currier. It also applied to photos black or colored. It carries Season Greetings. We use the application to talk to one another voice or looking at one another. It is used to capture and send it to other people. The list is long."
"Quick access to phone gallery not working anymore, it requires more clicks and you can't select several pictures at once. Whoever is responsible for user experience has messed up real bad. Quick access only to media within WhatsApp is ridiculous and shows complete disregard for user experience. What a huge step back on usability, disgraceful."
"I use whatsapp as my primary messaging/photo sharing app. But since the last update, I'm considering not using it at all any more. The new media picker is beyond poor, and has broken a functional design. I can't send photos from my screenshots or camera roll without several taps. I don't understand the logic behind this. I am also having to resort to going to my gallery to select more than one photo from my screenshots or camera roll. Please roll back!!"
It's a convenience communication tool that continues to improve it's services. Though it would be great if it was like before in the aspect that it didn't take hours to resend sms for verification. It would be very very very useful if there was a hide chat feature to keep your selected chat from unwanted eyes going on the app.
"Can no longer bulk send images since update. If I click on attachments the folders shown do not access the phones gallery. Click on more and select Gallery, but will only allow to send one. If I click on the + to add more I have to select via the same route, but it overides the one I previously selected and doesn't allow to select multiple. Makes sending pictures in bulk when I need to do so frequently rather difficult and long winded!"
"Everything about the app is good. However, after the update text status have been messed up. The text doesnt enlarge according to the amount of text on screen. The number of words that are typable have also been reduced and it doesn't warn you when the number has been exceeded when typing. Why the downgrade?"
"Awful last few updates. I am used to tapping the paper clip icon, which opened my gallery app and I was the able to select multiple pictures. Now, after tapping the paper clip icon, I can only select pictures and videos already sent or received previously in WhatsApp. I can get to my gallery app but via the 3 dots at the top right but I can only select 1 picture at a time. Please fix this bug. Thanks."
"I really love this app! I use it to text all of my friends, and it makes it easier to identify that I have their correct number (because of the profile picture). Although, the call quality is really poor. Also, on video calls, I would like it to show nothing when I turn my camera off, instead of just a blurry screen. Maybe you could show it as a blank background with my pfp/profile picture on it? What I meant by poor quality is that I can barely hear my friends. The audio becomes glitchy."
"I would not recommend WhatsApp to be used for businesses. However it is very helpful for individual usage. It delivers quick, timely, functional, and consistent communication between any two individuals over half decent Wi-Fi. It has its kinks to it, like kicking you off once you start running low on storage, or automatically downloading the photos of friends when you forgot to unselect that option. But over all it is a great program to use!"
"One app that has seen a tremendous jump in its users as well as public interest in the last decade. All in one, from sending photos to documents to anything you need. It's like a full on power package and a reliable application with security and privacy. Love the way, WhatsApp team is continuously working to bring great updates and features. the layout and user interface and every feature is improving with time and hoping for more in the near future. We expect a lot now from this amazing."
"It is good app but still i have a suggestion to implement as below: If anyone uses the one-time view for images, videos, or text, then screen recording or taking screen shots should be disabled so that this feature makes sense. I hope you will consider these suggestions and improve the services as soon as possible."
"Latest update forces the WhatsApp Gallery when wanting to send a file. You have to now go through extra steps to get to the devices storage. No setting to allow the end user to choose what the default should be. Obviously, no one really thought that out! Piss poor, but then again, that is how Facebook programmers are - they don't think."
"1) Constant backup issues. Now I have to use two copies of the app. 2) The app for Mac wants to update but it doesn't for some reason. And doesn't open either, so I use a web version instead. 3) Can't make a voice call quiet enough—even in the quietest mode it's too loud so that people in the same car can hear everything. There is no issue with that in other messengers. 4) And of course timeless classics—no way to use it on the laptop unless your phone has an active Internet connection."
"Latest update wasn't good, the app does not recognize phone's media and instead only shows its own (which is useless when it comes to send recent pictures from phone's camera). Also because it needs several steps now just to send a recent picture/image from phone's gallery, it can only send one at a time, which is tiring as hell, and finally, it can't send videos from the phone's gallery, since the app only recognize pictures. Fix this garbage. This update is really inconvenient and pointless."
"Update needs to be fixed. I'm not sure if it's whatsapp or Samsung but now all of a sudden you cannot upload pictures straight from your Gallery and instead it gives you a list of media from your whatsapp chats, which is near on useless. You can share pictures from your actual gallery if you go on more options but then it limits you to just one picture at a time. I'm not sure who tested this but it's a mess. How do you go back to a previous version of the app?"
"It's a really great app. Makes communication easier and fast. You make calls to both local and international, it's really awesome. But it would have been super great if it could have a feature where you met your messages where left them just like in telegram."
"Used to be great, not anymore. WhatsApp does not recognize phone's media after the latest Android upgrade. This creates a major inconvenience when it comes to sending files. In addition, phone calls disconnect after a few minutes blaming the phone's microphone. And on top of that, their customer support is the worst i have seen in a long time. So slow and useless. Such a big disappointment!"
"It is good app but still i have a suggestion to implement videos, or text, then screen as below: If anyone uses the one-time view for images, recording or taking screen shots should be disabled so that this feature makes sense. I hope you and improve the services as soon as possible. will consider these suggestions"
"Why I can't take a clearly picture easily, it always blur , last time is good , now so lousy , even though I use flash , it take a long time to come out the pictures , please improve it !!! I suggest you make a button cotton for turn off the vibration after the photo is took , maybe that is the main problem . One more things is the voice notes message, please don't auto put black screen for hearing the Voice notes , it's very disturb for some phone that proximity sensor very sensitive"
"i love this app, it's very reliable in my opinion, and it has good quality. I don't know what I'd do without it. I just wish there would be more features with the status viewing, where you can make different groups of people who can view your status, and also that you can see who viewed your status when your read receipts are off. I do however dislike the fact that we can't screenshot 1 view photos anymore."
"Had a great experience so far... However, after the recent update, > Whattsapp calls are taking way too long to connect. (Both incoming and outgoing). Haven't checked on video calls though.. > Messaging is working pretty fine. > Also.. while trying to attach a image from within the chat window, (especially which has been taken as a screenshot).. it isn't able to locate the image. Have to go to the gallery and use the Share option on the image. I am using a OnePlus 10 T"
"All the features are good and all, but the live location sharing isn't working very well. It doesn't update my location at all, it just shows my first updated location and that's it, idk why is this happening because my gps is turned on and the app is up to date. I hope someone can fix this because I use this a lot and it happens all the time."
"Don't know why they make it worse and worse every update. New way of choosing photos is awful. I have to take several extra steps to get to a photo, and today, I took a video and it wouldn't even show up in WhatsApp, so I had to open my Google photos and share via WhatsApp from there to send it. Not only that, but I'm having untold number of issues trying to call out to people using this."
Since the last update the app doesn't allow you to send multiple pictures. You have to send them one by one which is frustrating and on top of that you no longer have access to your camera gallery. You have to go through multiple stupid annoying steps to try and find the pictures from your camera to send 1 by 1. This app has changed for the worst. It is now useless and garbage. So disappointing
"A couple of issues: 1. When selecting photos to be sent, it no longer shows the phone's gallery folders by default. Very inconvenient to have to access it through the 3 dots on top left hand corner. 2. Unable to select multiple photos to be sent at once. Extremely inconvenient. Please look into it and fix them. Thanks"
"On Xiaomi mi A3, the app has 2 major problems: 1. Voice notes get sent empty after some random amount of time of app usage, force stopping the app and restarting solves the issue, but it's super annoying, you be talking for minutes, and boom, the voice memo is silent!! 2. When scrolling up in the chat, the chat glitches for a split of second and scolls itself up way higher than it should. Like, I just wanted to see messages from yesterday, but suddenly I'm at the messages from 4 days ago!!!"
"It's good in general, but has limitations like backup because we can only do it in our messages and contacts, could have how to make backups mainly of stickers, since it's deleted after formatting. The own backup can sometimes stay in the loop and doesn't finish, even though the internet be stable. Also we can't search for a gif and emoji directly on the WhatsApp, this will be so practical and easy to send if it was added. And when I search me to send anything for me, doesn't appear myself"
"My phone model is SM-J610F, there is a slight problem that needs to be fixed. On the status tab, when you scroll to the bottom, it feels like the frame is dropping a lot. So the screen is lagging and not as smooth as scrolling on chat tab. Hope this optimized ASAP. Thank you."
"A simple and lightweight chat app. You can send images with reduced size or original size as you like, and almost any file with ease. The main concerns are: 1. Somehow I can't reply any status at all with newer versions. The reply box and enter button isn't shown by swiping up, is it a bug on tablet devices? 2. Please increase maximum pinned chats/groups. 3 is not enough. 3. Somehow there are random business accounts those chatted me for unknown reasons and unrelated to me. Is it a bot spam?"
"Experience is gud as far as it meets the basic requirements. Few more things can be added like a section where we can get to see a list of all the groups we are a part of in the app, it's really annoying when I find some old groups made by our friends and now no one remembers that group. We should have a list of all those groups so that either we can engage it or delete it easily without going to scroll till the bottom"
I use whatsapp everyday! For the the past 10years! The last update sucks!!!! Cant select multiple photos/videos. Cant choose right away from gallery like before the first albums are whats app chat pictures. I would like it to go back how sending picture/video attachments were please!! Not only me other users feel this way also! Please fix this issue!
"Keeps getting WORSE. I cannot view one-time photos, even though my Whatsapp is fully up-to-date. Even my system OS is up-to-date. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling WhatsApp to fix it but it ended up creating more problems - the ""Restoring Media"" has been stuck at 4% and it is doing absolutely nothing. WhatsApp developers - please help me and FIX all the bugs."
"Whatsapp needs an update. I cant send people images from my phone. It only shows images from last week. I have to screen shot each individual image and past it in the message to send. Its incredibly annoying. And yes, media visibility is on. I have googled the issue extensively and havent seen any remedies for it yet. Please fix this!"
"I hope that WhatsApp cancels the last seen feature because it is annoying to me... On most modern devices, some people are online now, and the caller feature does not appear now, and we do not know whether it is inside the program or outside it... Please take into account this matter and know that it is a special privacy Others have it but it's annoying."
"Had a great experience so far.... However, after the recent update, while trying to attach a video, captured photo or screenshot within the chat window, it's not able to locate the videos or captured photos or screenshots. Have to go to the gallery and use the share option on the video or screenshot. I am using Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Lite."
"No ads, Easy to use, Well laid out, Receives messages and calls really well, Good quality reception on calls, Reliable, End to end encryption, Good status function (though not everyone uses it). Totally perfect! The creators definitely know how to cater for people's needs. Don't know what I'd do without it. If you don't have this app, you're missing out!"
"Since the latest update roughly a week ago I can only attach 1 picture at a time. Also when you go to attach a photo it doesn't automatically go to a view of your gallery. You have to click a button in the top right, select gallery, select camera. Only then can you view the photos you took with your phone or screenshots. The two most frequent things I send. Fix this right away please. Contemplating just using Facebook messenger if this continues"
"I use whatsapp on Mobile, Web and Desktop I'm not sure where I can submit a product improvement request/suggestion. I just notice that we cannot resize the zoom level of the desktop app. It would be aweosome if we can change the zoom level by pressing ""ctrl and +/-"". It would be great to have this feature thats similar to your other competitors. I know this is possible with whatsapp web but I don't think it would hurt to have the same function on the desktop app."
"Why oh why they can't set it so you can view GIFs without them being saved to your phone's gallery. I want to see them, but I don't want them to be saved. I've turned off auto download but then you can't view them at all unless you tap on the individual GIF,snd then you have to delete it from your gallery. Very frustrating."
"Absolutely terrible messenger. I can't believe anyone actually uses it, this thing drives me insane! The design makes messages barely readable, names are always unavailable, backups are a joke, notifications are messy, there are no pinned messages, no date searching, there's just so much that's missing or is working badly... It's like a curse because it's terrible but you can't escape it because everybody is using this app for some reason."
WhatsApp audio/video calls take a lot of the to connect when on data pack. When on wify connects easily. And no it doesn't happen because of data not working properly as I can stream anything easily when on data. So it's a software issue. Please fix it asap. I use one plus 10T. Please fix the issue...
"Over the last few months, this app has been the worst! It's so annoying, because I would use this app as my main source of communication with others. However, recently my messages just stop sending and video/voice calls are bad quality. The app doesn't work and it looks like it's because of network issues, but it's only that app that stops working!"
"It was really good, I enjoyed contacts and media and texts with my relatives abroad and my girlfriend (all with a nice snappy layout), but then one day things got corrupted and I lose profiles and chats. My backup files did no good, deleting cache didn't work, and restarting was ineffective. I had to reinstall this app and lose all preexisting data."
"Something has gone very wrong in the last update. When attaching photos, the Camera album is no longer accessible (only albums showing images from WhatsApp chats are visible, which is basically pointless). The workaround is to click the three dots, select 'gallery' and then choose 'camera'. This workaround only lets you select one image at a time though, and no video files are shown either! It's a complete pain. WhatsApp Devs, ease un-break this feature!"
Suggestions: 1. Restrict certain people from voice calling and video calling. 2. Add a PING!!! feature or something similar to notify us when something is urgent. 3. The ability to see if someone has quoted a message in their reply on the notification tray. 4. The ability to react to messages from the notification tray. Thanks.
"Recently, my android phone updated it's voice-to-text feature. The android text by microphone had been fairly accurate but suddenly, became almost useless. The WhatsApp voice-to-text has always been more precise than android's microphone feature. But ever since android self- destructed its microphone feature, WhatsApp is the only game in town. I'll rely on WhatsApp for all my voice-to-text work. I'm talking about serious work with important documents. WhatsApp is superior in voice to text work."
"Since the last update, the chat don't organize according to the date of messages. If one is to delete sone messages in a chat then the date of the last message is what it gets organized by. Since the update, the messages are organized since the last time there's been communication with that individual, even if you delete some un-important messages the chat doesn't get reorganized. Please fix this. The previous way helped a lot or at least give us the option to choose. Thank you for listening."
"The app was working fine until the recent update. When you call a person via Bluetooth headset, it connects your call to the receiver. But the receiver can't hear your voice. But can hear you when then receiver calls you themselves. Also the quick message notification feature doesn't deliver texts properly, with the sender not receiving the texts unless one opens the app. Please fix this issue as I think it is related due to some bug."
"Recent update really messed up the gallery section! Not only it doesn't open the phone's gallery by default, but even when you reach it, you can't find videos there, so you can't send videos directly from the app anymore. The gallery is showing only pics and there's no way to get to the video files"
"New update is horrible, can't send photos from my camera roll while inside whatsapp. I have to go into my images app to select and send from there. Horrible user experience and I hope they change it soon. Since being bought out there has been nothing but problems with each and every whatsapp version. I hate mark zucchini and what he is doing to this app. I hope you eat 💩 and ⚰️"
"Even though this app has been wonderful over the years, but after my recent update it became almose the worst of itself, I no longer get notifications for messages, and when there is an incoming call, I can't see the caller, I only hear the ringing, I have to go open the app the view the caller. This has to be fixed asap"
"Recent update: an update. POP UP NOTIFICATIONS NOT AVAILABLE - I haven't been able to receive notifications on my phone unless I open the app, I am no longer able to turn this feature on at all. Help! Also, when I try to connect to bluetooth devices, my phone is connect to the bluetooth but whatsapp doesn't recognize this and remains on the normal/loud speaker."
"I updated my WhatsApp two days ago but still, when some messages are sent, I can't see them because it's showing my WhatsApp has not been updated. Please fix this! And when I'm watching a video on someone's statue, the video skips to the next 3 or 4 stories and I can't even go back. Please do something about it, it's annoying. Thank you!"
"There seems to be an issue with chat sorting. Older chats of mine are being shown on top. A contact had last messaged me in September. They again messaged yesterday, and I deleted that message. Still the position of their chat is on top (it is not pinned). I have been facing this issue recently and tried contacting support but I get an automated response, ""this issue is out of scope"""
After the recent update I am finding it difficult in making voice call and video call too. I am unable to hear anything while making voice or video call through WhatsApp. It's annoying me a lot as I use this app for making most of my calls. It's a complete waste recharging my data pack. There is no option to contact WhatsApp team as well. What a poor service provider.
"I downloaded the app on my new phone, s22 Ultra. And for some reason I can't get pass the ""Initialising"" phase. It just keeps loading and loading and not doing anything. I tried everything, delete and reinstall, removed my Sim card, connected to wifi, connected to mobile data, turned off my phone, restarted my phone, still can't get pass ""Initialising"". Very frustrating. I use this app for work but I can't anymore. Hope they fix it."
"App is crashing when opening. Only opens when I get a chat notification. When I press back to go to the chats screen, it crashes!! I cleared cache, restarted phone etc. And the backup doesn't even complete, always gets stuck midway so I'm afraid of deleting the app and reinstalling because I doubt anything has been backup up. Absolutely disappointed Found out WhatsApp (dual) doesn't work if my secured folder is locked. Working now"
"The latest update is annoying as hell. I need to go several steps just to send a picture or video from my gallery. Whatsapp only recognizes the media from whatsapp folder, which is useless. Then i can't send more than one photos from my gallery. Please fix this issue and go back to the previous update. This is so tiring. I might go to another platform if whatsapp is still going like this for a long period time."
"I had a very good experience of using this application, and it's so useful for the person to have a conversation with the person who is far from us. just one suggestion you must add up the music in the story uploading so the people who wants to add music with photo or a video can be possible eaasily. Must do this change and update it soon, people will so happy to use it. Thank you very much.As a user of whatsapp , I have seen one of the new features I.e. poll selection. This feature is not so us"
"I used to be able to be on a call on WhatsApp and simultaneously be able to listen to other audio at the same time [useful when me and the person I'm on call with want to listen to a Twitch stream, Twitter Space, etc together and talk]. Not sure what happened, but I can no longer play other audio while being on a WhatsApp call. Please fix this issue!"
"Recently (For the past 2 days), My Whatsapp Profile Picture Keeps getting Deleted automatically. When I say deleted ,please note that,I can set my profile picture successfully. After adding and setting the profile picture successfully, There is no problem and everything seems normal. However,If I return to the app after sometime,There is no profile picture set!! I did check for updates and I updated from the playstore to the latest version.But the problem still exists."
"The new updates are bad and I don't like it.. if we delete any text from any contact, it's not getting sorted with the last msg available in that chat. When we try to look into profile pic it's opening status of that contact first which is horrible.. i am looking to revert the latest update. Kindly share the steps if we have that option. The latest updates are disappointing"
"Poor ux between mobile and desktop versions. Upgrade broke many things. Desktop version archive or delete messages does not do the same in mobile apps. Every time i use the desktop apps i need to take a long time to sync. New upgrade broke the photo attachment permissions. For people looking for a solution, go to settings, apps, whatsapps and allow permission for photos. For crying out loud, learn from telegram."
"Since you allowed use web WhatsApp off-line the experience got terrible. Before that the web WhatsApp was fast and reliable. Now you start the page, takes so long to carry on the messages, when the tab closes it takes another eternity to reconnect. It also often lost the connection, and some messages apear on the phone, and not appeared on page, or vice-versa"
Recently annoying. Every day for last 4 days it's constantly trying to backup and failing at 98%. I've tried turning backup off and it's still attempting it. I've restarted my phone. I've deleted some chats to reduce what it has to backup. Nothing works. There's plenty of storage space. I've just tried uninstalling and downloading the app again. Let's see if that works....... it didn't........
"Restoration of the backup process is full of glitches which can easily cause you to lose access to all your backed up chats, media, etc. Customer care is non existent when it comes to any solving issues. Automated messages are the most you can get out of them. For such a widely used app, this is extremely frustrating and disappointing."
"It is a terrible app. When you will have to switch from Android to iOS or vice verca you will understand what I mean. It will be impossible to move chats across and you will have to pay $30 to some weird software for this. Telegram doesn't have such problem since it is cloud based. Secondly, they limit account to 1 device when I have 4 phones that I use all the time. On Telegram you can add as many devices as you want."
"Facing issue in sending the media files from today. No updates were made and I had latest version installed. If I try to open the camera from WhatsApp chat, the screen freezes for sometime and get backs to chat if I try to send the file. If I try to open gallery, it takes few minutes and then gets back to chat. Storage available is around 40gb. Device: One Plus Nord 2T, Android Version 12"
"good app, all messages can be sent and calls can be answered perfectly fine. although, i really wish for status they could add settings. it would be much better if we could customize the fonts, how big and small it is, and so much more possibilities. with each update the size of the fonts keep changing, it was so good before, small just to my liking but now its way too big. i know for some people they would prefer big fonts, but i would prefer small ones."
"First of all app is awesome but need to update on Status Bar. For example some one wants to upload a video message to on Status,if he/she wants to share video which is more than 3minutes. So he/she have to post for 6times(30 second) that is very annoying. Update on Status bar,so we will post the video of more than 30 seconds in one time only. That will be very helpful for all of us."
"Whatsapp started interfering with the keyboard and other screens when you minimize during a video call on the phone. If you return to the screen, none of the buttons work. Everything is up to date, so please fix this bug, as it's becoming a huge inconvenience"
"Good day, WhatsApp is an overall great app apart from a few minor issues: After the recent update you can not view a profile picture anymore because it has a green circle around the picture and it takes you straight to the status that was posted by that person. And also please can WhatsApp make a separate tab to split the groups and individual chats completely because the tab for communities makes nothing different. Thank you."
"The quality of pictures or videos when I posted on status or text is so bad. Extremely bad. I hate it so much. The video/picture was actually HD before i send it. But the WhatsApp quality ruined it. From 1080p to 144p real quick. I can't even see anything bc of the quality. Also why my voice note button isn't functioning well ? It has been months, i've updates the apps so many times yet the voice note still can't be used well ? Fix this."
"Nice app but unfortunately when I reinstalled the app due to a problem it was having, all the photos downloaded from WhatsApp to my phone gallery were erased, over 2000 photos and memories lost. I didnt have it backed up but I thought if photos were saved to my phone that meant they were saved. Apparently WhatsApp has the ability to erase photos from your phones photo gallery. This seems like a massive oversight in the way the app works, it should only be able to add photos to your phone."
"When sending a message it doesn't show if it is delivered, you need to back out of the convo and back in to see that double checkmark otherwise it will remain with 1 checkmark, very annoying because you don't know if your message sent through or not, if it's a connection issue or a bug! Very frustrating. S20 FE"
"Photo attachment function broken. As per other user's comments, in Android V13.0 on a Samsung, photo attachment is now a complete naus! You can only select photos sent or received within WhatsApp in the preliminary folder view. To attach a picture you've taken on camera, you have to click three dots and go through a secondary picture or gallery app. And then you can only select one picture at a time. Ugh! Please fix this."
"used to be very reliable but since FB/Meta took over it's a buggy mess version upon version. lately I have lots of problems with audio clips. they're sometimes completely silent, and after sending one the whole thing bugs out and no further clips are sent. you're just there talking to yourself the whole time. furthermore opening the camera for in-chat pics or status updates locks the phone up until the app crashes. we don't need more features, we need the current feature set fail and foolproof"
"Before the update WhatsApp was amazing. Now, when I go to send pictures I can't. It only shows the pictures that I received from other WhatsApp chats. I then discovered that if I touch the 3 dots on the top right corner I can open my gallery, but I can only send one picture at a time and all of my videos are missing. I have to go to my gallery app to select a video and send it one at a time. PLEASE FIX!"
"Still much space needed that one has to dedicate all storage space in the phone and the forceful upgrade of the App is very annoying, even when one is not ready to upgrade. So frustrating. One should upgrade when one is ready to create the space. Imagine 292mb for this App upgrade! A very convenient and handy App. Great in all ramification except in data and storage consumption. Awesome indeed, very useful and almost indispensible and so easy to use!!! Consider blocking group than exiting."
"Been using for years. I've just got a new phone and can't have pop-up notifications on my lock screen - this is seemingly unavailable for Android 10 and newer, which is crazy! Why would it go backwards with a newer version? It's a real flaw, especially as my notifications are always on silent and I usually just glance at my lock screen to check. Everything else still has pop-ups so WhatsApp is the only one - come on IT folk, get your act together! Pretty please.... 😉"
Would be good if you could add location to pics/videos shared on Status. And have Live video sharing on Status. Also Why does it have to have 'contacts to invite' under your list of contacts. Very annoying if you want to quickly scroll to the end of your contacts to now have all these random numbers that you would never invite. Some are just short codes listed not even proper numbers. Very annoying and messy looking
"I keep missing video chats because the phone doesn't ring. It's been happening for over a month now. Used to think that it had something to do with my phone, but the persons phone I'm calling also didn't ring, only notification shows up. Edit: Lately video chats are impossible because of the noise, everytime I say something, this terrible noise appears. It's so bad that it makes video chat impossible so we switched to another app. Please fix this noise."
"its a pretty good app i like the updates alot. the voice note speeding feature is my favorite. there is one feature id prefer to see as a new update is an audio recording feature on calls. as i am a studeny, i tend to take explanatory lectures on WhatsApp. it would really help if i could record the audio. i hope you'd take it into consideration. thankyou."
I am having a great experience with this app and this app is improving a lot. But the function linked devices is so much trouble when you are using this function it's all right but what if someone use to hack your messages. Please introduce a feature for the linked devices function like a lock and password.
"This version of whatsapp if so messed up. I could send voice messages through whatsapp before but now that option is corrupted cause of the new updates. This meta version does not let me send any voice message, if i record and send every time it shows only 1 second record even if its a 10 second recording. This has bothered me for a whole year i need solution on how to fix this problem as i have tried everyway possible to fix it with the new update but nothing works. Please fix this problem"
"Can't screenshot 'view once' media anymore. This is really silly as my friends use 'view once' to send things without using storage on our devices (since WhatsApps saves everything locally) so if the receiver wants to save it, they just screenshot it. How about just giving the sender a warning that it was screenshotted?? Big tech needs to stop forcing us to do what THEY think is right for US. If you send things online then assume that they'll be saved (take responsibility for your actions!)"
"I am facing a problem in Whatsapp relating to sound. I am not able to hear Voicenote sent by others,neither my voice record works. It plays but there is no sound. The sound of any videos or audios sent by others is inaudible if I play directly in Whatsapp. But the same Videonor Audio's sound is clearly audible if played in other media apps. I am not able to resolve the issue. Kindly note and help me with the same"
"I'm very disappointed to the customer service and the system. The chat history has been backed up in the old phone, but when the new phone is replaced, it shows that the chat history can't be restored, and the machine crashes. Trying to log in again doesn't work either. We have request the OTP by phone call two twice, first time we get OTP but the system show us the OTP code is incorrect, second time we didn't get OTP via phone call. Until now we didn't get any response from customer service"
"Used to be great, not anymore WhatsApp does not recognize phone's media after the latest Android upgrade This creates a major inconvenience when it comes to sending files. In pddition, phone calls disconnect after few minutes blaming the phone's microphone. And on top of that, their customer support is the worst i have seen in a long time. So slow and useless Such a big disappointment!"
"Very Nice Experience with WhatsApp. But I have a suggestion. The option for scheduling messages. For example, if we have to wish someone on their birthday, we may forget it on time. If there is a feature of scheduling message, we can send the message earlier, and it will deliver on time as we selected earlier. Waiting for this update."
"Okay so it's a great app with great features but I'm having a problem with the voice note feature. Normally when I pause a voicenote as I'm recording it I should be able to listen to it before I send but recently, after sending like 5 voicenotes I become unable to listen to them before sending until a few hours after. Please fix this. Thank you ❤️"
"Major issue faced is, after the recent update video calls automattically stops while talking. Especially while connected to a bluetooth device. It shows the ""microphone have issue please restart your phone"" but after that also the same problem is detected. It's very difficult to face a problem like these, from this application. And it's very uncomfortable for me to deal with these kind of BUG. Hope these problems will be solved."
"Great App! There's just sometimes some glietiches but overall great! But i suggest that on status we can make them so only certain people can see, so of I'm making a surprise party, I'll make a status about it and put only the people that are going to be in it, in it! Another one, i think it would be fun to go live on WatsApp! The people on your chats can join and see! I would also like that i can record videos without pushing the button all the time but instead you click on it to make a video!"
"As someone has already mentioned, the latest update has messed around with the gallery whilst sending photos. Yes, you can click the 3 dots in top right and find the main selection of photos but you cannot select more than one at a time now and making it a timely process. Seriously needs to go back to how it was. Please fix!"
Since the last update you can't send videos at all it won't even bring up your videos as an option to send what so ever. The gallery that pops up is what has already been sent/received through WhatsApp yes you can click the 3 dots to find your other photos but can't send multiple at once. You need to fix this awful update. Wanting to send short videos to family is now impossible
Great app indeed. But would like to suggest to add some new features. It would be amazing if there's an option to turn off online status so that when you're on WhatsApp others can't see it. The option should be customizable for certain people just like the status option provides. Last seen option should also have the exact same facility. Happy chitchatting guys!
"Like others have mentioned, ever since the latest Samsung update, I can no longer attach a photo from my camera gallery to a WhatsApp message, I can only access media that I've been sent on WhatsApp. My work around has been to attach a document and go to images, but the photo attaches as a jpeg - not ideal as I can not see the image of what I have sent. Please fix this WhatsApp!!"
"One app that has seen a tremendous jump in its users as well as public interest in last decade. All in one , from sending photos to documents to anything you need. It's like a full on power package and a reliable application with security and privacy. Love the way , WhatsApp team is continuously working to bring great updates and features. the layout and user interface and every feature is improving with time and hoping for more in near future. We expect a lot now from this amazing team........."
"Inconvenient to attach pictures and videos. It was super easy before this last update, and I would have easily given it 5 stars, but since I can't easily link the photo galleries and folders I want to link, I'm only giving 2 stars until they fix it. I'll change this once the fix is made."
Overall it's one of the best messaging app. It's too smooth and gives best experience in conversation. But 1 thing which it should have and will be very appreciating is auto-splitting of complete video in parts while uploading status. If it can upload a complete video in parts of 30sec than it will be very good as it will not break the continuity of the video.
"I don't like the idea of opening status by clicking on profile. Please remove this feature. To see the profile picture, I have to open contact, then click on name/number, then on profile and have to choose View Photo . If any one want to see status, they can go to status tab and check. I don't know why you have implemented this feature to open status from profile picture."
"Good cross-platform alternative for Messages. Some changes would be suggested though. Feature missing, can't be singed in on two phones at once, unlike iMessage. Also could better image and video quality shared. Biggest drawback: doesn't use cloud storage (Telegram and Discord have implemented it). WhatsApp eventually takes up 10 GB on my phone and only option is to delete messages."
"Always used WhatsApp, but it could use much more improvement or ideas. For example all the updates you could've needed 10 years ago like pausing audios are only here now... I hate the new updates with the avatar and not being able to screenshot or screenrecord only on one (x1) pictures, like, a lot. My girlfriend and friends hate it, too."
"Local Backup doesn't work at all. Lost all my chat history because there is no option to simply tell Whatsapp where to find the backup file. It should be found automatically but it dosen't. Being a Software developer I'm pretty sure it's not my fault. But never mind, mostly switched to Signal anyway. Due to other reasons like data security and so on..."
"The app's mostly fine. My biggest issue is that when I want to upload a video that's longer than 30 seconds and I trim it let's say somewhere in the centre, whatsapp does not save the trimmed part but instead, sends the first 30 seconds. As such, I'm always forced to use a video editor (InShot) and then forward to my WhatsApp status from there. Finally, please stop with butchering image and video quality; at least make it an option instead of forcefully compressing size and quality. It sucks!"
"What on earth is going on? Half of the notification settings have been removed and what is available doesn't work. I turned the group notifications off yet still my phone has been blowing up since half 5, it's currently half 9. I used to be able to select who I can get notifications from specifically, that option has also gone. Pls stop changing things that make the application redundant. Thanks."
"Previously when I used to delete a message from a chat, whatsapp automatically use to resort the chat list according to date. but now when I delete a message, it does not change the chat list by date. For example, if someone messaged me last month and then again today, if I delete todays message, his chat will not move down to last month. In fact, it will remain on top of the list with last month date/time on the right. Does anyone know how to fix this issue?"
It's been years..... For heaven's sake please add an option to tag everyone in a single message for groups instead of having to add each name after @. I don't think this small thing deserves the entire app to get just one star but i doubt it'll get any attention unless i do so. I love the app otherwise. Also don't know if this is the right place to mention but please bring back sticker packs on the web version. The kind where you add sticker packs to the phone and it gets synced with the web
"""Something went wrong with your chat history..."" This happens to me daily for monthes now, daily! It is such a bother!! The 2 AM backup triggers this everyday, plus, sometimes it'll also accure seemingly at random throughout the day. Worst thing is, the restoration is not working properly and I have to guess when to force close it and hope to not lose days of my chat history. Many times I do lose several days and have to resort to reinstalling the app which causes of course the loss of settings"
"Oh dear! It's not sending messages, despite amazing internet connection. It's generally a good app. But rather than say memory too low it just removes some of my chat before I can back it up. Really upset ☹️ no reply from app. Also why is the video editor bit next to the back option. Stupid really as it loses the video if you go out by a millimetre."
"Great app but keeps getting a little worse with each update. Latest, when you try to attach something from the gallery to a message it takes you to the WhatsApp gallery and not your phone gallery. Extremely annoying change! I use this feature all the time and they just added two extra steps/clicks to the procedure. Is there a way to reassign the gallery link? Hey whatsapp, you know the WhatsApp Gallery is available in the phone gallery, right?"
What on earth is going on with this app? It worked perfect until the last update. Now when I'm trying to attach a photo from my phone it's only showing the photos between me and that specific contact. If I want to attach a video it wont even appear at all. If I want to attach multiple photos I actually have to go into my photos app and share from there to WhatsApp. Like it's completely the opposite of user friendly right now.
"Cannot see or download pictures or videos keeps giving error message. Plus when pictures are sent they cannot be seen they are just blurred out! The app crashes allot more since updates recently! And now the call quality is worse than before, sometimes can hardly use calls it just doesn't want to work! This used to be such a good application! But not just problematic sadly! I really wishe these glitches would be fixed"
"As much as I like, and use this app daily; I have one niggle, when on a video call. I have a z flip 3, and it automatically goes into split screen if I flip it up! All other apps, have the option to choose full or split screen, when flipped. I want it to stay in full screen mode!"
"Ever since the last android update on my Samsung gs21, voice and video calls have issues with the sound breaking up. Occasionally it drops the call completely complaining about a microphone fault. There is nothing wrong with the mic. I've cleared the cache but that made no difference. App is currently unusable for calls which is totally infuriating!"
Ridiculous. After the latest update you can no longer attach multiple images at one go. Instead you are forced to repeat image selection by going through a tedious clicking spree. Backup is never successful and slows down your phone. The Microsoft WhatsApp app is even worse. I'm moving my whole hospital's communication to Telegram. WhatsApp has been a complete nightmare.
The app is good. Constantly improving and adding new features to it. WhatsApp may think to add a feature where a sender can send a message in an encrypted or in locked form which a receiver may unlock after a due date or on happening of certain event or after putting a password shared by the sender. This feature will help the people to convey their feelings or emotions on real time basis which they don't want the receiver to know right now right away. Looking forward to it.
"After the recent updates, during a video call my speaker is making some strange noise and for the next 5-10seconds the members in the call can't be able to hear anything. It happens repeatedly many times in a single call(length of call ~ 3-5mins). Kindly take note of this and clear it at the earliest."
"Using galaxy s21 fe.. after updating it to Android 13, the following issues are noticed- 1. If i want to send image from gallery, it does not shows the complete photos. Only few photos are available. I need to go into phones gallery to send the photos. 2. Even after deleting contact, it is still showing in WhatsApp contact list. Tried deleting it multiple times, but its still in WhatsApp contacts list. Kindly sort it out."
"hi head WhatsApp is a very high and an easy means of communication. Through WhatsApp, people from all over the world are very close to each other, but sometimes there is a problem that is the problem of speaking the language, because one country is different from another country. I don't understand the language easily, there are many countries in it that the language is very strange, such as China, Japan, Indonesia, etc. Sir, I suggest you to use all language voice translator, call translator an"
"Data migration from one Android to another is a nightmare, you have to upload a lot of data to Google cloud and only then download it to your new Android device. Although you can locally backup the data, there is no option to restore it from your local backup and it's not even a difficult thing to achieve."
"Usually works fine for chatting, buy I hate that it's tied to a phone, fully proprietary, and somewhat crippled when not giving it the invasive permissions it requests (such as contacts). Also transferring chat history to a new phone is an absolute nightmare, doesn't work, and restore only happens when reinstalling, which has horrible timeouts for the verification code."
"I have to say , I really hate the new update. Sending pictures in the gallery shows only stuff that I received or have from within whatsapp. The 3 dot gallery doesnt show any of the most recent pictures or videos I took . This app os very inconvenient for work at the moment. Telegram does not to have this situation. Works always and I think we might switch to Telegram . Do you guys even test your own app or take any feedback ?"
"The app used to be great till the past few updates. Firstly, STOP AUTO TRIMMING A VIDEO THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN TRIMMED TO BE UPLOADED TO STATUS UPDATES. THAT'S NOT THE POINT OF AN OPTION FOR TRIMMING BEING AVAILABLE. Whenever I want to upload a video to my status update and I've trimmed the part I want don't want to be seen, once uploaded it automatically trims the part is wants. For instance, I want 25secs-40secs to be seen in a one min vid, it automatically trims it's own portion once uploaded."
"Terrible update that's ruined the app!! As others have said, attaching photos from the camera roll now takes longer and you can only send one photo at a time. Can't work out how to send a video, which was easy before. Please fix asap!"
"Update: Media Permissions had been revoked by Android 13 update. Working fine again. Lately, it's just unusable. Can't send videos or share anything as easily as I could. The Gallery only shows media I received, unless I go to a sub menu, which only displays photos. No videos. The main reason I use this app for."
I have not been able to sign in for 3 months now. I get an error message every time. It's glitching it takes me to the page where u put in your name immediately upon opening the app. Even after uninstalling and reinstalling. Good first experience but now?!?Terrible!!!!!!
"I love the app! I've used it for years. However, the app date is giving everyone issues when attaching photos or videos directly in the app. I can share them to Whatsapp from my photo gallery, but not while in Whatsapp. We're waiting for the resolve. Not sure, if this is linked to an operating system update or an app update."
No real point in using when you can't see the other person online status. As far as privacy is concerned disabling last seen and double ticks were enough. Atleast online feature would help in quick communication or knowing the message would be read soon after. Now it's just like ordinary messaging apps where the other person can easily deny they never got to see the message.
"Since the latest update (12/9/22) i can receive incoming calls but can no longer actually join them. You get stuck on a screen saying connecting until the call drops. Images are not being sent in private messages, you simply get stuck on the screen. Absolutely hate this new update, please fix it."
"I get trouble with voice recordings,albeit someone sending/i recording one,my screen blacksout and refuses to allow the recording to go through.Video/voice calls are always trouble, either not recieving or not notifying me of an incoming call.there is many more to add to this list;wallpapers,pictures,status,etc.Normally one would thinks its the Wi-Fi/the phone itself but all my other apps works fine,wifi is strong/overally great,even got my phone checked out and everything is fine.Pls fix this."
"You touching things you're not supposed to. What I mean by that, is you touched something that wasn't supposed to be broken but you broke it. Listening to a 15 minutes message then replying to it and then trying to resume it where you left off, the message starts all over again and you cannot skip forward meaning you have to listen to 10 minutes of the same message to be able to finish the last 5 minutes really terrible."
"Agree with the previous reviewers that whatsapp is just dead now, so many updates yet you can't fix a simple gallery/photosharing options. Why was that tampered with in the first place? now I can't send video frm my gallery. I have to go into the gallery and share the video via share option. The app has discombobulated my gallery views from WhatsApp directly. You can't select multiple pictures to share. It's bad enough that the video quality& picture quality you wish to share is reduced already"
"After the last few updates it seems to have gone downhill. Pop up notifications are now removed and I've been trying for 2 days to either re enable them or at least tell me who exactly I get messages from besides ""you may have new messages"". Saying ""pop up notifs aren't available for your android"" when before it was possible and did it automatically. Please fix this,the convenience of having messages be replied through the pop ups and notifications is helpful. Again pls fix this"
"Every update it gets worse, uploading files, photos and videos is so stupidly difficult now, I have to go to gallery, select stuff then share to whattsapp, but if it's more than 30 items at once, it'll all deselect and I have to select and sort it again, the features are trash and there's no invite system or rank heiarchy in groups, you either have no permissions or every permission. This app has fallen off big, i recommend you leave this app and find a better messaging app."
"I would not recommend WhatsApp to be used for businesses. However it is very helpful for individual usage. It delivers quick, timely, like kicking you off once you start running low on storage, or automatically downloading the photos of friends when you forgot to unselect that option. But over all it is a great program to use!"
"Unreliable backup and restore process. Was getting a great trade-in the deal, so I backed up everything on googledrive and brought a new phone.. Highly disappointed as i was unable to restore the chats from Google Drive backup. The process kept failing. Tried multiple recovery tools to extract chats from backup, but no success!!"
"Great app. Feedback— There should be a way to easily login to multiple accounts and easily switch accounts. Even it'll be better for the web version to work on mobile device browsers. This way it's undistinguished from SMS where I need to check multiple devices, then connect them to internet to collect or send information."
"SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE UI 1. Justify the content in the text box, it is not very satisfying to see the text messages not properly alligned. PLEASE JUSTIFY THE SENTENCES INSIDE THE TEXT BOX OF BOTH SENDER AND RECIEVER. 2. And it would be better if the dark mode is DARKER (black not grey) 3. Adding a smooth transition for chats rolling up and down for new messages would be better to use"
"Overall, it is a good working app. Calls and video calls could lag a little less, but it isn't as bad as it used to be. Another option to log into WhatsApp Web must be added by developers, as scanning QR code isn't always an option. You may not have your phone with you and that is most probably the reason why you need to use WhatsApp web 🙃"
"Really dissatisfied with this app, it used to work great up to the last update, now it doesn't let you use media from the gallery, you can't pick multiple photos or videos to send like before, really bad for the work I do , need to be able to send multiple photos, it's gone from 8/10 to 1/10"
"I'm using Android version 10. And my WhatsApp doesn't show pop up notifications and the time and date messages were sent. It also doesn't show the last seen even though I made my last seen to be shown to my contacts, it only shows 'last seen at' and no time will be shown. What could be the problem"
"Great app, but I'd love it so much more if it didn't default to opening in a message when I click through the app (not a notification). I intentionally leave messages unread until I have a response but if I want to check another convo the app automatically opens the one that is unread."
"This new update definitely has some few Pros, but as a UI/UX design analyst, I particularly feel the new camera position should be switched with the ""community"" label, because that's not something a lot of people will get used to, and there are a few bugs to be fixed in the messenger itself Thank you ."
Edit 12 28 22 The new update makes pics harder to send and whats with the volume? I was a solid five stars 💫 now 2.5. I use this app every day for business and family. There are new features I haven't tried or need a better explanation in their help section. A secure connection is important to me. They say it is. It's my go to for international calls/texts/messages.
"Great for the most part. Unfortunately it's *always* telling me it's either unable to backup or that it's trying to backup. I backed it up this morning, it's said ""preparing to back up"" ever since. I can't get rid of the message, it stays on my notifications and it's super annoying."
"The call quality couldn't be worse, same issues with Facebook and Instagram calls - the background noise is more prominent than the person who speaks. The speaker's voice is partly cancelled. It seem the opposite should be done - cancelling the background noise and optimising the speaker's voice."
"There are many problems with the last update... I can't play videos or audios when I'm in a call, I was able to dobit before the update, and now ""popup notifications are no longer available in my version of Android"" My phone is a Galaxy S21 Ultra. I know it is not the last one, but c'mon... is not even 2 years old!!! Hope you can fix it..."
"This update is annoying. If you try to attach photos from the app, it doesn't let you access the camera roll and has the weirdest way of organizing photos. Video and voice calls don't ring with a ring tone customized or otherwise! Please fix this!"
"AWESOME!!!!! NO ADS AND A BIG VARIETY OF CONTACTS! ADDING CONTACTS IS ENDLESS! THE APP COMES FREE WITH UNLIMITED TEXTING AND STATUS!!! EMOJIS, STICKERS, AND BITMOJI IS FREE TOO! The only thing is, that when you click on a picture, sometimes the word bar disappears and it's quite frustrating, especially because of my autism."
The recent update is very bad..it is very difficult to connect as we are not getting calls and messages direct on the screen and not getting the notifications ..it becomes very difficult to all time open the app and check please change the update as soon as possible.. Thankyou .
"Used to be good but lately when I make a call or a video chat the person on the other end cannot hear me. They said the call was breaking up, meanwhile I am hearing them fine. I have tried restarting the phone, taking out and putting the sim back in and turning the phone completely off and nothing is working."
"Everything everyone said in these past few days + I cannot find the videos from my gallery to attach! Took me a while to find the pictures, which is very inconvenient, and now the videos. I have to go to the gallery and share them. Very time consuming and not user friendly at all."
"Lately, I've been starting to face an issue and I'm a bit unsatisfied. Im not able to check if the person I'm texting has seen my msgs....the blue ticks don't appear...it's been a few days since I updated the latest version and since then I've been facing this issue. This issue really frustrates me out and I'll be hoping that the management solves this issue and the ones others are facing after the latest update..."
"A very good app for quick and brief communications and to exchange pics, docs or short videos. BUT I started experiencing a new bug or something, when a recent chat is deleted, the contact is still showing on top which is beyond privacy. Is there anybody who can help me to fix this issue."
Please hide the muted status and also hide the archived chats. Without that it's of no use.. Whenever archived chats send a message it pops up which makes the feature useless and also the muted statuses appear on the screen and get clicked accidentally. I want to give 3 stars but giving 1 instead so that it pops up in the section!!
I like using whatsapp as it connects people from all spheres of world. But from the past few days I have been experiencing issues in the app......the chats get restored but the present day's msgs disappear....and today without any notification when I just opened whatsapp all messages from every chat disappeared. I tried backing up again but no avail. Please help me retrieve my messages back especially messages of my work groups. Thank you.
"Last update made it very inconvenient to send screenshots, since the attach an image button doesn't take you to gallery, and need to hit three dots to get there. Why would you even bother spending any time & resource changing something that works perfectly fine."
"My sent messages quality is low and not clear. While on messenger the quality is the best , so I can't blame the phone mic or internet or phone quality. Sometimes calls are not making a sound, though I have all sounds up. Or either I sometimes don't see the call ringing show up, but then I get a notification about missed call after the caller stops calling"
Im sorry but this new update is complete trash. The new image layout is ridiculous. Used to able to select multiple pics at a time now have to do one at a time. Calls dont even come through unless i open the app and ive checked all the notifications. Seriously need to fix the issues here. Supposed to get better with updates not worse
"Didn't mind the app, but with the new samsung update,the gallery only shows whatsapp meda and photos before switching the over to the forlder in the 3 dot sub menu, and i can no longer send multiple pictures at once. You have to add and send them individually, making it less user-friendly."
Since the last update you can't share images basically without having to select them in a round about way. This needs an immediate fix or I'm going to stop using it all together because the only reason I use it at all is for the ability to easily share images. Which now is next to impossible.
"i request to the developers maximum people needs privacy for only few person , but we can not able to set any password or fingerprint for a particular person, that is the worst thing i am facing. i request to the developer to create a feature so that we can chat privately. in tv ads they shows that privacy end to end but in real life every one wants privacy for few persons"
"I don't know what's wrong but lately my incoming calls on whatsapp don't ring, my settings are all checked and is correct, it started about a month ago after I did a update, can you please check if there might be a problem. I have a Huawei P Smart phone. I also cannot sent videos from my Google account anymore, said file not supported. You need some issues to fix please, as calls are impossible to hear at times that's now if it rings. Before last update this app was best, but not anymore."
"With the recent update (25/02/22), I am facing a glitch with the voice notes function. The audio is not playing back to both myself and the recipient. 25/12/22: In a previous update, the issue had got resolved. But this problem has resurfaced as of today."
"I don't like the new update... I don't have my gallery folders on the whatsapp anymore.. It only shows folders with my contacts name. No camera, Facebook, screenshots or custom folders like it used to. It shows recent but only taken on WhatsApp and sent on WhatsApp... Please change it back.. It's a struggle to go to gallery and select photos from there.. And also on WhatsApp it doesn't want to select more than 1 photo at a time.. I can only select one and if I try another one then it switches"
"Since last update am having so many issues, can't listen to voice recordings cos the screen goes black, I don't get notified when someone is calling me, my phone is ringing but not showing whatsapp as calling me so have to go directly to app & click to see who is calling..nothing but problems since the last update, thinking about not using it anymore."
Whatsapp is a good social platform but recently I am facing a lot of trouble to backup my data. Whenever I try to backup is stucks in a point and stop backuping. I hope whatsapp will fix this glitch as soon as possible. Because without backing up data we are in risk to lose data. Thanks for reading.
"Hi,WhatsApp thank you for updating the apps in terms of ScreenRecord video quality, but for the pictures the quality has decreased a bit, but that is not the main issue of i writing this review, I want to tell you about the Avatar that the developer gave us, we are happy to use it, but is there a limit to its use?i used it throughout the message yesterday, that night also i can't use anymore, please fix it soon,because i like it, on my screen it is a menu it displays ""sharing failed, try again"""
New Update now makes sending pictures difficult. You have to go through several steps to get to your gallery and then you can only share one picture at a time. Before it was one easy step and you could send multiple pictures at a time. As most users have commented this new update has made this app horrible. Please fix it Before we stop using Whatsapp.
"Bug: Chat randomly scrolls to the top for no reason, really annoying. Not a problem with the device since I use other messaging apps as well. Also: The default pen tool should be the thinnest one and camera shutter button should be just a bit bigger, UX testing team should stop slacking off so much :P"
"After recent update, the operation become more complicated. Screenshot cannot share immediately to Whatsapp. Also, thru WA, click to attch the picture, the picture not available in all media. Have to close WA. Open gallery, click the image and share. Wth... Before update, the version work marvellous. After update version, it worst! 🤦"
"It's a great app, also love it because it allows a large number of members in a group chat. Thank you also for adding the feature allowing admins delete unwanted contents on a group chat, a sign that the team listens to users requests. I would plea that the app has a way to allow sharing of screen and even control of device both on Mobile and WhatsApp Web. Great work team!👍🏼"
"WhatsApp is getting worse by every update, switched on my phone and noticed I couldn't open a particular group chat, other messages and group chats could open except one which will totally close WhatsApp to my phone interface if I should tap it. I keep receiving notifications on that group but can't access it. Secondly I'll have to go to gallery first before I can send pictures. Please do something about it. Thanks"
Undo update is really amazing..but.. Not much happy with the updated version of inchats feature..which is That after deleting texts chats not move to their original or previous position as the details in the last text in the chat is showing.. need changes in this feature... Thank you!
"When I delete messages without clearing the total chats the individual's chat stays where it is... It doesn't get back to its original position... Which was not there before the update... I don't know it's a bug or not but I will request your team to fix it and make like before, deleting the messages and bringing them back according to the time slot of their last message... If your team can fix this I will be very obliged..."
Kindly fix the bug from the latest version 2.22.24.78 1.) Automatically videos frenzied while video calling. 2.) There was an error for paying the video while watching status. 3.) Sometimes Automatically closed application during working time. 4.)I recommend you please add A feedback section in WhatsApp where user can submit their opinion as well as Bugs. Thank you for Better Service . From BR(INDIA)
"I am here to share about the latest update that everyone has been complaining in the reviews. It's not that we cannot share our media from our phones, but the permission setting was turned off after the update. So we have to change the permission to allow sharing from our phone. Idk why they changed such a thing, but we can still share it after changing the permission. I hope this helps!"
Latest updates makes the photo sharing from the gallery a difficult task. And can't attach multiple pictures at once. The hassle is very terrible. Why do you change something that was not broken? Why complicate things that are easy? I don't get it. This rating will remain like this until it is fixed. Will share this review to my family and friends so they will give the same rating and review.
"After installing the new update, I am not happy anymore because of the bugs that appeared with attaching photos or videos: When i tried to attach a photo, I should make many steps to go to galary to access all photos. Then, I couldn't attach many photos per one step. I couldn't find the videos when searching for it, but I should open the galary outside the app, then select whatever I want, then send them through whatsapp."
"Pathetic app. You are a billion dollar company still you backup restore is broken. I have both the offline backup(files in Database folder) as well as backup on Google drive(I cross checked in my drive and it's there) but still WhatsApp is saying 'No Backup Found' . I one by one logged in each and every Google account I had, but still it's not detecting. I had important chats from past 5 years and now it's all lost. I will be looking forward to shift to Telegram for atleast my important texts."
"Am I the only one having trouble with getting call picture-in-picture to work again after the latest update. I am so used to be able to minimise a video call in order to multi-task while being able to simultaneously still see the person on the other end of my line and have them be able to see me too, but I can't get that to work anymore. As soon as I navigate away from the app, my camera shuts off now."
"Hey WhatsApp creators. Great messeging app all things considered. I have an issue with being able to share statuses, there is an easy way to share statuses to facebook but the app cannot do the same through to Instagram.. Since these 3 apps are intergrating, I feel that statuses should be easily shared once and for all to whatever platform I choose, I should be able to share it to either Facebook or instagram or both of i choose.. So, here is a suggestion hopefully it is implemented."
"It's a good app. I have a suggestion though. It would be nice if WhatsApp could send messages or videos to a group of people or a selected amount at a specific time, just like an alarm. For example as long as there is data connection it would send I wish you a merry Christmas at exactly 00:00 to contacts"
I love this app to keep up with my sister across the pond but all of a sudden I can no longer access my phone gallery to send pictures let alone multiple pictures or videos. I am not the only one having this issue. Please fix this glitch and issue then it will go to 5 star. If it helps I have the Samsung galaxy z fold 3
"I used to love the previously updated version. However, the update on Oct 8th '18 is not so good to me...they have removed the option of ""delete for everyone"" which referred to deleting a message sent erroneously or not. I can now only delete a message I sent at my end but the receiver will STILL receive said message. SMH"
Can't see contact names. Since the latest update most of my contact names have vanished so I'm left guessing as to who the message is from. I have had to reload each contact individually..... Please fix this! I have refreshed and allowed all permissions.. Still not working properly.
"Whatsapp tolong tolong tolong sangat, upgrade untuk pengguna nak forward file, photo, video, documents, or others. when we select this, pengguna boleh select more than 1, then can forward or share to other app like telegram or Bluetooth or others app at the same time. I really have problem when I want to forward something from Whatsapp..I had to forward one by one..do like that.until it's finish. So please, upgrade anything to forward..CAN SELECT ALL THAT WE NEED, THEN CAN SHARE TO OTHER APP"
"Suggestion. While recording voice, add pause feature. So when we make long gaps, even that Gap may not be recorded. Tx👈 I had suggested this in 2020 April, amazed, that it's today fulfilled. Also, you can let us delete the portion from a time stamp, go back and delete what was spoken from voice audio, Your app is amazing"
"In the latest update a lot of people seems to have problems accessing phone media, which i also had, until i look at the phone settings and realize that the permission to access phone media for whatsapp was not allowed, so i turned it on and this fixes the problems. Hope this fixes the problems people been having."
"This recent update is stupid and sucks!!!!! I can't send photo from phone gallery directly from the Whatsapp. Now I need to access multiple annoying steps to phone gallery to find my photo to send and it also doesn't allow us to send multiple pictures, I have to send one by one which is frustrating. I saw many users complaints already why Whatsapp doesn't solve this problem. I hope we can get it back the previous version of Whatsapp. Please please please update again."
"Very difficult to set up. Fixed to specific mobile no. Should be email linked for use on multiple devices. Impossible to transfer to new phone without loosing chat history. With so many other messaging apps available, WhatsApp is not worth the hassle."
"In the latest updates facing some problems 1.) Currently I'm using Samsung A52 phone and facing a problem while sending any picture to any one ,it not showing all the images folder it only shows the WhatsApp media but at the above on three dot it shows the gallery but unable to share multiple images it only allow me to share a single images 2.) While uploading any status the folder of videos is not showing. Dear team please consider these problem ,this problem occurs in many samsung phones."
"Very helpful! But is it possible that you can use the same number on two different phones? And also is it possible that you can send yourself WhatsApp messages like you can email yourself on gmail? Thanks a lot WhatsApp, keep up the good work ♡♡♡♡♡ Why can't I copy status captions? It's good when I can copy and paste stuff written under pictures and videos we put on statuses."
"Uodate Nov 2022 This update was worst ever for Android. One must go & search for a media file, it no longer lies under Gallery, Audio etc. Its deeper & u have to follow several steps to find & attach to send. No man Whatsapp! I will rather revert back to the previous version that never had these issues."
Please provide option to record the audio call. Other person is better not notified about recording. Also provide option to organise multiple chats of similar type to be together for personalization.. e.g. in a combo (or a label) i can put my colleagues.. another combo can be of friends.. and another one for family etc.. a contact can be in multiple combo also. Right now i am able to create 1 such combo using archive feature.. so a particular type of chats are there. But i need more combos.
"There's a peculiar glitch with the new update..I cant play videos while on a whatsapp video call unless its netflix, prime or YouTube. I could do this before this update on browsers and other platforms without problem. Not sure why this is but it is disconcerting. I get relunctant to download updates nowadays because they seem to make things worse."
"So, I got blocked and unblocked at least 3 times in 2 weeks, now my phone number has been unblocked, I followed the instructions to re register or login but have been stuck at the ""initialization"" for 3 days now and counting... My internet connection is in perfect condition I even uninstalled and reinstalled it but to no good, It's just sad how what's app has become this... Have used this app for over 7 years and never experienced this... It's been frustrating and exhausting..."
"Some album in gallery is not showing when I want to upload the videos or pictures to status or personal message. Pls rectify this issue. For an android user like me whenever I want to upload status, the quality is sucks. Pls rectify this problem even though the quality we take using our pictures is in high quality.."
It's great app but I think makers should give us several sections for groups and simple chats. It would look more satisfying. Although app is great 👍👍👍👍 but I think some features like instagram like status and seperate section for groups both would make it more cool and handy for use. If this is there I'll definitely rate it 5 stars.
Seriously Meta. Take note of what we're saying......... It is now impossible to attach an image to a message without going through a ridiculous convoluted process and you can only attach 1 image per message !!! The iPhone version is still the same and this is how we want it. Sort it out.
"After the latest update, I seems to be can't one shot select as many photos to sent my other person and ended up always had to sent one by one photos to others and that is really very inconvenience to me. Please downgrade the previous version. Thanks."
"Why I can't send latest picture from my gallery through the app itself? I have to go to my gallery to do that. I found it very inconvenience and wasting my time. I don't know how to fix it, and I hate this. I can't re-install my whatsapp either or others picture that being send before will be missing. I hope you can take this issue seriously and fix it accordingly. I have been using this app for years, please don't dissappoint me."
"Adding photos directly from Whatsapp became almost impossible since the latest update. Doesn't matter if it's a screenshot of a picture i just took. It's not listed anymore under most recent photos. Besides that, backup also doesn't work anymore since latest update. Awful."
Very useful and handy app. Recently I am facing a problem. Incoming message notification tone in .mp3 format not working. I downloaded notification tone in .ogg format. It is also not working. When select these tones default tone comes in picture.
Can no longer see the latest photos I took when sending a picture through WhatsApp. This only started in the last week or so. I have to go I to my gallery and share from there to WhatsApp contacts which is annoying and takes a lot longer. Defeats the object really. Please fix!
"What happened to the app, it's ridiculously difficult to add pics and vids now. You still can but it doesn't seem to recognize your media any more. To add a video you have to share to the app from your media, so you have to go out of the app to do it."
"Latest update broke file sharing. It no longer goes directly to phone's file system (e.g. Gallery or directory) and instead only shows WhatsApp media in the ""All Media"" section. Need 3 extra taps to share stuff now. Super duper irritating, folks. I've resorted to sharing directly via my Gallery app instead."
"This app was already deleted for months on my phone, when I suddenly received a message to verify my ""phone"". In short, someone is trying to access it on another phone. I redownloaded the app only to be hindered by the verification and needed to wait for an hour to have another verification message be sent. I want my account be deleted on this app!!!!"
"Everything works as expected. Just a suggestion, add an option to share the messages and media to outside apps also. This is a very basic feature which should have been there in the first time."
"Why is it that whatsapp always greatly reduces the resolution of an image once I put it as a profile picture? In my gallery it would appear very clear with high resolution, but once I put it as my profile picture it gets superr blurry and of very low resolution!! Please you should kindly work on fixing this issue it is very annoying!"
"I hate when playing a voice message and trying to listen to it closer to your ear, the screen goes off and message stops playing. And now that you're actively being forced to watch other users' stories whenever you want and try to watch their profile pics, well... just effing great 👎🏼"
It is the best app for communication with friend and family worldwide but I have a point to improve it. I would like WhatsApp to have the option in the status to edit photos or postcards with music effects like Facebook history. Thanks for your support and success business
I've been using this app for my whole life it's good ngl. It'll be more easy if they add a feature where you can edit your own message after sending it. Like if you accidentally type something wrong you can just edit it so it would be easy.
"Since this morning the app does not open and start anymore. Last night it was still working, and there was no update of the app in between. But even after a phone restart I can now only see the splash screen for a split second. Android 11."
"After new update: 1. No possibility to select photos from ""all media"" folder; 2. After photos are found, no possibility to select multiple photos. Very inconvenient. With such ""excellent improvements"" WhatsApp will lose long term users...😡"
"High efficiency pictures Save space by capturing Photo mode pictures in high efficiency image format (HEIF). Some apps and websites don't support HEIF, & Reduce file size Save space without sacrificing video quality. The results will be saved in HEVC format, which some apps and websites don't support.is must be there in WhatsApp"
"Overall the app is fantastic. Everything is good but there is a need of one more thing in this app. The thing is there should be an apk file send option in files sending option. When we send image, audio or location etc there should be one more option of applications apk file.🥰"
"Update has ruined the app. I can no longer send multiple pics at a time, I have to go through my gallery to add each one separately. Gallery layout has also changed, shows whatsapp gallery only until you click the top corner to go to phone gallery. Its an awful effort to share a few pics. Zero stars. Go back to basics. Back to when everything worked."
"The new features are cool but when you want to forward a message to someone or a group, it takes forever for that to happen, kindly work on that and add new features like ability to put voice notes on status and the read receipts should work on groups, it's only working for personal chats ."
"Okay, i really want you to shift the archived chats to where they used to be. I mean atleast nobody could see them. It makes no sense to bring that on the top. What's the point of archiving then? I understand ya'll were trying to save the trouble for us by not letting us scroll all the way down to reach to the archived chats. I appreciate the help. But please put it where it used to be. All the way DOWN. THANK YOU! everything else is great. I like the latest update. Please fix this though."
"It a nice app as it provide many features like video call ,it enable documents sending and download ,video calls , multiple photo sending , voice notes , also it allow a user to manage setting and other features forestance stutus ,charts ,groups for me this is nice app but what I don't understand is the aim of backup message on this app but it nice WhatsApp app to use.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Hi Guys, Hope you find this review infirmativeu. My only concern with the app is just to make some changes in the app UI as IOS just for some reference so you can understand because DARK MODE is not just a black pallet but it also pays a some sort of role in saving battery and also prevents our eye strain. Hoping to get a revert from you."
"The new update is not intuitive at all especially when trying to attach and send photos. Camera photos does not show up in recent or in my all media folder. While if I go gallery add photo, it removes the photo that I have already selected before that."
"It's getting pathetic after every updates :( I can't see the status msgs like normally, nor the medi shared is getting blurred by default no matter whether i use in mobile data or wifi! Also no matter i connect Bluetooth, the Video/Audio call doesn't pick it up. Also cos of a bug here I lost 13 GB of Data 😭 Where's the Back-up option in WhatsApp 😭"
"Just like it's being reported, this last update made the service worse. Cannot upload photos or videos from my gallery although I just recorded video and took photo. It worked before on my Samsung but now it doesn't. It defeats the purpose when I'm not able to share required information for my business with my clients abroad"
"It used to work really well but as of late I don't get notifications unless the app is open, and calls won't connect. I've tried to see if there's anything in my settings affecting this but there isn't."
"Wonderful UX.. There's a bit of an issue I noticed Since the feature of viewing status is available from profile pictures, when I select the profile picture and it pops up along with the message, call and Info icons, instead of popping up the pictures, it still pops up the status"
"Gallery has changed! Used to be able to send the last picture taken, now you have to take extra steps just to do that, also you can't send more than 1 image at a time which you used to always be able to do, this new layout is a dud"
"Whatsapp is a great app, but the problem with the new update is when I delete a chat, it won't go down to the chat of the previous date in the interface, if the developer could figure it out make it for the previous version , that's more easier."
It is very laggy and when i try to speak with anyone the person could not hear it and when i open whatsapp it shows that it's doesnt work. And in icon the profile also doesn't work and when i try to send something to my friends it becomes laggy and the message which i send didn't so can you please fix this problem.
You need to either take away that the icon popping up on your screen when you get a message or give people the option to disable it. It's annoying when you're apart of many groups and the icon pops up Everytime someone messages. Messenger does this and has done for ages and that was annoying enough.
"I don't know what's wrong with WhatsApp but I'm facing this problem for pretty long, I cannot send voice text to anyone I mean I can but it's literally blank, I cannot hear my voice. I can hear others but not mine when I send voice msg. And hope What'sApp adds 60 mins for a status and make new emojis more, especially heart emojis."
"Cant even log in 2 device, after log in it's forced me to restore it to use the a Backup (because can't restore it after skipping that). Private? But can't even add someone without phone number something like their ID or else. API use charge is a little bit expensive for people just want to build small business"
"WhatsApp has been working greatly for video call. But after recent update, I'm not able to make video calls as it automatically disconnects after showing 'connecting'. And if someone calls me, I'm not able tp answer, too. I'm using One Plus Nord CE 2 5G."
"Ever since update, it's been terrible accessing photos. You used to be able to access your recent photos, screenshots, documents easily. Now they're only accessible through your phone album. So much has changed. Worst update ever."
"The app does not recognize my phones media anymore. I now have to open gallery to share photos, where as before I could just do it on what's app I also can't send multiple pictures at once anymore. Other users are experiencing the same issues. PLEASE FIX THIS"
"Hi Team! hope you will be doing well. I just updated my whatsapp after you enbled group call feature by link. everything is working fine but . even i call someone privatly ,without any group voice/video call . status bar of my mbile shows group voice call in green top bar with time duration. please fix it keep it simple as before .. change this text to group voice call only when there is multiple people in call .. dont show it as group call if two person are calling in simple call mode ."
"The support for this app is just trash. It's been almost 2 weeks I lost access to my account and can't log in(for a mistake on their part, as said by them in email), and their best answer is to check my phone reception. Absolute trash."
"Would have given one star but every other new feature is okay except video call, it's wrecking my head. Everytime I am on videocall if my camera turned off by chance it doesn't turn on no matter how many times i try it shows its on but it isn't if so I have to hang up the call and call back again, it happens almost everytime. Fix this problem"
I request you to update in your WhatsApp- The mobile number must be automatically visible in the video and image etc. located in the existing gallery folder of the phone and in their properties. If you will do this function the public and I shall be highly obliged. Thanks a lot.
"Contact list sorting is based on actual message received rather than on the base of messages stored in whatsapp. This sometimes shows unnecessary contact on the top, inspite of deletion of the messages from that contact. Previous version was better."
"Everything is cool after the new update, but I noticed that I can't view streaks from my friends using iphone. I get a message that my version of Whatsapp does not support that message and I need to update, but I'm currently using the lastest version. That's my only problem now."
"Hi. I can't send videos that belong to my gallery album directly from the app. Now, I have to go to Gallery and choose videos to send, which is not as fast and practical as it was before. I hope we can get that option back. Thank you in advance"
"Link a Device not Working as Expected. Device like realme 9 Speed Edition & some OnePlus devices are not getting the option of ""link a device"" at the start-up setup which is implemented on new WhatsApp version for using same WhatsApp on different devices. It is working on some devices as expected, but not on every devices. Please check on this & di the needful."
"Everything's okay, but notifications do not always work. All permissions are available, but app anyways almost never displays incoming calls, and sometimes messages. Hope you fix this problem. Ty for the attention."
"Yes its did meet my expectations, but i will suggest it best whatsapp add some editting features, such as when you type and send a wrong message, you could just hold on, to highlight the wrong message and click the edit option to rewrite its wrong. Thank you as you comply to this request."
"It's great, but I would like some changes, such as: 1- Increasing the length of the status to be 1 minute 2- Improving the quality of photos and videos when we share them in chats and status 3- Separate hiding viewing status from hiding viewing messages 4- Add the option to save the video or image in the status 5- Add reacts to the status Please take these suggestions into consideration"
"Not happy. My camera photos folder is no longer included in the Gallery list and I cannot attach more than 1 photo at a time, even if I find the gallery of my camera photos in the top right dropdown. Very frustrating and pointless."
"Updating to 1 star as they still haven't fixed this and the developer contact route is a joke...What has happened to the photo upload feature?! No longer gives instant access to your camera roll, only to WhatsApp images. Have to go elsewhere to get to your camera images.... SO ANNOYING !! WHY?!"
"All your updates and new futures are so good. But kindly include, ""schedule message"" option, which will be very useful. Scheduling option is available in almost every social media platform. Why don't you start in WhatsApp also? Hope WhatsApp developers will consider this suggestion and roll out ""Scheduling Messages"" option soon."
"I liked the old update better , idk it's just annoying now bc it legit deleted all my contacts and even when I tried resaving them it didn't work , I can't send a video bc it's either too long meaning I will have to shorten it Wich also makes it a challenge so I feel if those mistakes were fixed it would be much way more better , in short ...plse bring back the old WhatsApp because this one is giving stress"
"After the recent update , Iam unable to watch status or add a status. I am only able to see a blurry picture and not even moving. And sometimes audios sent are unable to hear. nothing is working after the update. Nice work 👎👎👎👎"
"Lets me connect to ALL my overseas friends. One thing I don't like is it automatically puts all picts,gifs etc in my gallery. Dec2022-edit=Took away 2 stars as it always needs updates and no longer get notifications. After updating shows 138 msgs then icon disappears from home screen!! I delete picts,etc from gallery & its repopulated again by what i removed! Cumbersome task!"
"Each time after answering a whatsapp call, the subsequent incoming whatsapp call, the ringing tones will not ring and the clock alarm will not function. Error 'Unable to play during a call' will show if trying to change ringingtone, alarm/notification sound. Remove Whatsapp phone permission after each whatsapp call or restart phone can temporarily fix this. Report this issue twice, problem not solved but they closed case!!"
"The recent update has ruined the media sharing feature in broadcast list as well as in groups. I am not able to send pictures, videos, documents etc. in my broadcast list and groups. This pathetic update is very much annoying and causes inconveniences."
"Pretty good app. Did the latest update just now and not having the problems I see many complaining about, like not being able to upload multiple images, etc. I hope not! I just wish there were nicer Flowers options and that they would be as beautiful on all platforms. For e.g. the hibiscus flower (pretty pink) looks authentic in the instant/pop-up messaging feature but looks weird in the normal messaging/opened App feature (brownish/redish/orange/ angular looking flower)... (For Android)"
It was good and adding the screen share option... It may easy...like...to show content to others. Hi Android support I want to present a new idea to update the what's app is if we want to send the wishes or any message to a person or persons at a particular time we have to set a time date day ... If that option is available then definitely the message will reach to them if the data connectivity is there... This update will help the people who want to send their wishes in advance
"After the new update of WhatsApp it has some new glitches that are need to fixed as soon as possible!! The voice call is glithes, sometimes sound doesn't comes. The video call also has the same problem sometimes the video is post automatically and camera in mike doesn't work, please fix it!"
"This app is irritating a lot since 2 months. The video call stops automatically and the app gets shut down. This is happening everytime i use whatsapp for videocalling. Before 2 months even if i use whatsapp for 2-3 hrs, nothing used to happen.But now it is shutting down only after 5mins. Please look into it. We are using this app just because it is more widely distributed. If this continues no doubt of deleting this."
"Hi team, In previous updates, it seems there is new feature included in whatsapp.( i.e Message yourself). It is working perfectly fine in smart phone/mobile phone. But when the whatsapp is connected through whatsapp web, Message yourself feature not working. We are unable to open the chat for our own in the whatsapp web connected to pc. Hope this bug will be deployed in the upcoming deployments. Thanks, Sam"
"Such a horrible app, I've have many memories, texts, pictures and videos saved in whatsapp and yet they have the audacity to delete everything. for NO reason. no warning. no nothing. even when I backed up my messages I had 500MB+ I did all the steps and yet it for some reason went to 22MB with no chats, everything deleted. I genuinely don't recommend this app, it's so laggy and buggy anyways. not worth your time."
"The recent update no longer show the DATES of our previous messages which is NOT a good idea & we as WhatsApp really don't appreciate this change at all !!! May I request that we have the previous format that reflects messages dates, Please ? Thank you very much sir ! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏 Suggestions : 1) can we have the STATUS sharing time to be limitless please ?? 2) Ever consider of developing fonts with changeable colors ? It wl be so cool n fun , just a suggestion . . . TQ in advance & CHEERS !!!"
"I just wanted to give a suggestion that in the option of not letting anyone see when we are online and when was our last seen, if we enable to option, we are also not getting to know these informations of others. Sometimes it can be a critical situation and it might not strike the person to disable there privacy settings and see. I hope you work upon this problem."
Keeps on cuttingour at random times even when connected to the Internet. When the app decides to cut out it makes a very annoying beeping noise that trigger my PDST and my anxiety. If possible can the makers of this app fix and change the the reconnecting beeping.
"With the new update, I can't uninstall whatsapp from my android. Every time I press uninstall it bounces back. I hate this new update. Many messages are lost due to the latest end-to-end encryption. When my friend in Germany sent his messages at the time that my phone was off, it took three days to download his messages, even when both of our phones are back on."
"Updates seems to have solved most the issues I have before. However, I would really like if more colors can be added to the Status background or users can select a status background from a color picker... And also, if we can also select/change font colors in status"
"So far I'm having a great experience with the current version. Just one thing I would like to request, if it is possible that you could categorize the messages/Chats (personal and groups chats) seperately that would be good."
"Recent update is very annoying. Even after deleting the chat, that contact stays on the top. Older chats remains top. It's not chronological. When contacted whatsapp help, getting only automated response. Kindly revert the recent update."
"This app has been performing well but recently an issue has been troubling me, everytime I uninstall whatsapp, the whatsapp media(images, videos and docs) gets deleted from my phone. How to resolve this issue? It is extremely irritating and its not a one time issue. Please look into it."
"Very easy and been the best messaging app that I use so far. I wish wassap can also add the on-screen option so we can share info from devices while video call more easily. But other than that, this app almost perfect."
"The first problem is that you cannot send video for more than 30 seconds in this and you can set the status only for that long and the biggest problem is that you cannot pause it like you have turned on your data, it turns on immediately. app is third quality"
"Ever since I updated this app, I have been having issues with the voice note feature, I can't send voice note, I will record voice notes multiple times and I won't be able to send it for weird reasons unknown."
"It's a good App, but when you have an issue Customer Service is terrible. Have an issue with the App. Raised a question through feedback (which was hard to find as WhatsApp doesn't have Customer Service number and email is hidden). Got a respond that there is 7 days grace period before issue can be addressed. After 7 days the case was brought up again with Customer Service and for over a week it's not resolved or even start working on resolution. Very disappointed."
"Latest update has made this app almost unusable. It doesn't access my media to send pictures or video, I have to go to my gallery and share through there. This also happens on iPhone as well so it's not just android."
"Well it's a great app but there's an issue including the voice messaging. It always goes black and quiet, my friends experience this often too. It gets annoying. Please fix this!"
"After updating, there's more steps that I need to go through when you send photos from your phone gallery. I can't select multiple photos either. I prefer the old version. It was simple and practical. What is this now....."
"Really nite app, I have been using this app for a couple years and is excellent. The only thing is missing is that it need to be updated with a new feature, perhaps adding a chat head so messages pop out like in Facebook messenger. I would love that."
Used the app from 2015. Overall a great app.but I it has a slight problem wich I wish could be solved. When listening to audio messages the device turns off automatically. Apart from that I have no issues
"After the latest update, I am not able to select more than one photo in whatsapp and thus, not able send multiple photos at a same time. (that means the features like hold the photo for a few seconds and select multiple photos) Please fix this problem."
"It seems to be an issue with the chart sorting in this new update.older chats of mine are being shown on top.A contact had last messaged me on 22/12/22 and the same person messaged me yesterday and I deleted the message.Still the position of the chat is on top, instead of falling back on to the msgs received on 22/12/22. Several times contacted the support on this issue but no use , closing the chat automatically by replying it is escalated or issue is out of scope"
"Unhappy with this update. Unable to select photos easily to send or to add on status. The process is prolonged. Can see only photos from the WhatsApp album, not able to see from camera or other albums."
"Total privacy failure, even after deleting a particular message the chat head of a particular contact stays at the top of the messenger. Indicating we cannot maintain privacy. Earlier whenever you delete a single message the chat head goes down to the last date and time when we sent a message to that person. Now many times whenever i had some personal messages with my friends and even after deleting the chat head stays at the top of present day. Very failure"
I've used this app for years and have always found it to be good. Except now something has changed and I can't send any photos that weren't sent to me on whatsapp. I can only share photos from my photo gallery. It's super frustrating.
"The feature that allow you to select the specific status you want to check should be added to WhatsApp, please. All statuses are not equally important It's so annoying seeing a user with almost 30 post on his/her statuses and you have to check them all because you are interested in the last post"
"Used to be very good until I got this sudden problem with the Gallery shortcut not working anymore. You now have to take extra steps to send a screenshot and you can't send videos. Very annoying, please fix."
"Stopped receiving pictures, files, calls. Deleted app, reinstalled app, gone through every fix and nothing has worked. I don't have an SD card, I have tonnes of space, I've restarted my phone (pixel pro) several times and still nothing."
"I think it's cheating that only iPhone can preview a chat without opening it... Please add that for androids too 🙏🙏🙏 Could you bring back that feature, where we could save a contact profile picture not just only groups?? I'd like to suggest you add a feature so we can pin statuses too... Thank you"
"This update is not nice please. You can't attach picture with msg , u can't send multiple pictures. When you delete a message the person still stays on top. Voice not keep playing and stop. Please do something about all these. Thank you"
WhatsApp could incorporate a feature that allows people to post pictures like Instagram feed and allow people to personalize the list of people who can view these feeds. It'd take the app to whole new level. Also feel that customisable themes for the entire interface must be introduced.
Can't do Bluetooth calls? Really like doing calls through my headphones as I can do things. And WhatsApp won't allow it to happen. It's not the 3 separate pair of headphones. It's the app. Fix it.
A great app but why does the archive folder comes on the top when you select the keep chats archived option.if it stays at the bottom it's much more convenient and mostly better.for example if I have kept a chat in archive and the notification for that chat is disabled it doesn't has to pop out of the archives to show itself.
"It was okay at first but now this app is getting annoying as it always messes with whatever status I'm trying to upload.... although I upload my status correctly after cropping it however I want, when I check it later, the part which I had cropped out gets uploaded and the part which I actually want to upload, it gets cropped out.....please do something about this or else I might have to uninstall this app....why keep it when it's not at all helpful to me...."
"Why in God's name are you guys reducing the quality of my videos and pictures sent to your app, it's really frustrating and trust me you don't even deserve the rating you have right now. I had to update to the latest version to see if quality of images and videos was improved but sadly I was disappointed, please ensure you guys make another update available, this time around address the issue of reducing the quality of images and videos sent to your app and it should be done ASAP. Thank you ✨"
"After the recent update, I haven't been able to send videos on WhatsApp. The video starts loading and then when it sends, only one second is seen and the colours look very faded. Please fix this ASAP."
Best chatting app ever but . One problem is im finding is everytime i voice call someone for too long disconnecting the call by low network performance but on the other hand from main voicecall it doesn't happen or no network problem but WhatsApp do have this problem with voice call..... 5mins calling is ok around 40 min or 1 hour there started showing... The issue... And the rest is absolutely fine
"I can't use WhatsApp phone call and my phone at the same time, it mutes my voice for some reason and I have to stay on whatsapp the whole time. There needs to be a tablet version similar to desktop because I can't use my mobile WhatsApp and tablet at the same time like I can with a laptop which is really frustrating. Video call when my phone is on standby makes no ringing noise. The settings are terrible and don't work when applied."
"Why is there no way to contact support? I can't get into personal WhatsApp or business. Both say no connection, try again, but it never happens. I can't access WhatsApp at all. I've been using the same phone number for the last 22 years. I've rebooted, uninstalled, reinstalled. My internet is working for everything but WhatsApp and I've tried to send a message on your website, but after filling it all in, there is NO button visible to actually send it, on phone OR laptop."
"This is OnePlus phone. On WhatsApp only, the sensors don't work right. I cannot listen to a voice note with my phone at my ear because sometimes it will switch to ear and at other times not. Similarly, it will not switch back from ear and it becomes impossible to switch back from ear before the voice note/call ends (the screen stays off meanwhile)."
"The new update is the most infuriating thing possible. You can't send photos properly because it's only linked to WhatsApp. So you find a tiktok and then have to search through your gallery to find it and THEN send it to the person. It's absolutely irritating as anything! Hate the update with everything in me. Please please fix this, you're killing me"
Its almost a very amazing😄 app i just loved it and it is a very good thing to communicate others and to share any of the pic or videos or document and see the status of others who have to show us anything and wants to tell us and want to realize. etc. Through status its just amazing to tell peoples indirectly😂. Even u all should download it its very amazing. My opinion is to download it. I LIKED IT😘
"I'd like to suggest that you make the ""starred messages"" option available for each contact, instead of the general one that shows all starred messages in one place. So it's takes less time to search, especially when you've starred so many messages from different contacts and groups. It'll be way easier when you already know who sent you a message that you've starred and can get it right there in ur chats rather than having to go through so many starred messages. Btw, I love the app💕"
"Since Android 13 upgrade, I can no longer set the phone gallery as the default folder to open. I now have to go through a number of steps just to see my gallery. I can only see files received in WhatsApp by default now. Extremely frustrating. This needs to be fixed ASAP!!!!!!!!!!"
"I am not a techy to evaluate extensively but as a user i am happy with using Whatsapp. But i have a request to cancel showing us being 'online',by choice. People on the other end tend to think we are free and available for chat, which may not be true always, and get offended if we don't initiate a chat or reply them immediately which makes us delay opening the app altogether and miss out on important news or message something important. I would appreciate if you can have a button to show online."
"Hey Whatsapp Developer Team, The app is fantastic as the numbers and ratings already tell. I just wish there should be a way to turn off Whatsapp even when you are connected to internet, you are unable to receive messages until you turn it back on. Like a log in log off button without the hassle of adding credentials. Just a toggle button to either receive or not receive messages no matter you are connected to internet or not. Looking forward to such update soon. Other than that its awesome."
"As much as I like the app, since I was forced to update few days ago, it's been the worst app ever as i no longer get notifications for messages. Even when calls come in i only hear it ring so i have to open the app to see who is calling and also be able to pick the call. This is crazy at this point. Please fix this quickly it's no longer funny at all. Thanks"
"After the latest updates, conversations are not dropping in the message list even after latest messages are deleted. Highly inconvenient. Means you have to scroll through the entire list to figure out the unread conversations."
The app has has been fluctuating Nad has not giving me smooth communication when u are on calls. It will connect and disconnect connect and disconnect. making it difficult to have a smooth conversation. This has been on two weeks. I even had to delete and dowload a new version thinking it was the problem. It has been been like even the whatsapp business too
"Previously when I used to delete a message from a chat, whatsapp automatically use to resort the chat list according to date, but now when I delete a message, it does not change the chat list by date. For example, if someone messaged me last month and then again today, if I delete todays message, the chat will not move down to last month. It will remain on top of the list with last month date on the right. Does anyone know how to fix this issue? Give us the option to sort by date pleaseeeeee"
"I really like to text my friends and stay connected with them through this app, but recently whenever I send them messages, the ticks on the messages are not turning blue even though they've read my messages. I have been facing this problem since 1 week. Because of this, I can't figure out whether they have seen my messages or they haven't. I literally have to call them to know whether they've read my messages. So please kindly solve this issue ASAP."
"This app is terrible, at first it was working perfectly fine until the app literally stopped being useable. Any time i tried to call someone? Black screen and the app would stop responding. Any time i tried to listen to a voicemail? App stops responding. Redownloaded many times to try and fix these issues but they kept happening. Dont download it, its garbage."
I have the same complaint as everyone about the inability to share photos from my phone's Camera/Gallery directly from a chat. I also am frustrated at the lack of ability to send more than 1 selected picture at a time from the gallery and the other issues in this latest update. I do hope Whatsapp or some clever person comes up with a fix and notifies us all.
"Bugs, Network issues, Poor UI, Redundant Features creating extra steps to forward photos. Back ups have poor integration whilst messaging seems constantly delayed or slow. Honestly, I hate it and it won't matter because there have been no improvements over the years. Frustrating platform."
"The new update absolutely sucks. On Android you can no longer upload multiple photos, NONE of your videos show in the gallery, it's a pain to even get to your camera roll & only shows previously sent whatsapp media. I use this app as my primary messaging app for friends & family in Canada and in Nicaragua & you've made this very difficult to use conveniently. Please fix this or I'll find an alternative messaging app to use. It'd be great to message someone who IS NOT IN YOUR CONTACT LIST TOO."
WhatsApp worked perfectly until yesterday when it made perform an update. When I agreed on it it wouldn't download it but keep telling me that it needs to be updated. After uninstalling and reinstalling it's still the same problem. When I downloaded it through an another apk it would constantly sign me out. I have a Huawei nova 9 phone. Thanks in advance for your advice.
"If I delete messages from one chat, the chat remains on top of the list without reverting to his chronological order based on the latest to oldest. Hence I have chats with the last message showing as of few days ago, staying at the top of the list. Very annoying, truly annoying"
"Video and voice call line still not very stable, the disappear chat message is very annoying cause every time need to set once the user settings it and it should be set by the user not to bothering us ... Why not giving us a feature clearing all the messages instead of disappearing?"
Used to be good and the tech support is 10th rate. About 3 updates ago they managed to break a perfectly good app. The ability to send video stopped working with an unable to send video error message. To compound this none of my messages to tech support have born any fruit and have to explain the fault every songle time. Months later it still doesn't work. I now absolutely dread these mandatory updates.
"I have a problem when I was calling through video calls. It's happening ti now since the recent updates. The problem is when I was on the video calls and then my camera is turned off accidently or not, the screen is turned on profile pictures (PP) instead of just a blurry screen like before. Honestly, if it's compared, I like more the previous ones than these recent updates. Please to whatsapp's team to FIX this. Because it's so annoying thing for me as a one of daily user of video call. Thanks"
"After new update in December 2022, i am not able to set WhatsApp status while choosing the photos. I am not able to access my phone gallery whenever i go to WhatsApp status. I have to go to my phone gallery to choose photo and then i have share the photo direct from my phone's local gallery. This is very annoying. Old version was good and user friendly."
"I add a status click the icon to add another one. The undo button apprears and I accidentally click that. Do again. If you implemented status function do it perfectly. Add every necessary actions. When we add a video in the status it should be ready to post. Not like I click on the video and it starts compressing for 69 hours. I cancel and add the video again, again it starts compressing in the background for 99 hours. You can't even see the progress is it compressing or stuck there."
"I just got a new Google Pixel 7 and the video call quality using WhatsApp is awful compared to my old phones and to the camera app on the Pixel 7. The video looks somewhat blurry on my own screen, but is incredibly blurry and looks like it's in 240p quality on the recipient's phone. Because the camera looks fine with the phone's camera app and other photo apps on the phone, I think the problem is WhatsApp. Please address this problem. Thank you."
"All videos send without audio constantly since android update. New update so far has been awful, please fix bugs. Deleting last message doesn't move contact down the list they stay right at the top, also harder to access gallery photos and only able to send 1 at a time. Quality has dropped quite a lot. Notifications have also reset somehow."
"Calling doesn't work on Galaxy S21 ultra and after android 13 + one ui 5.0. I'm getting an error after few minutes saying ""call ended because there is a problem with your device's microphone. Try restarting your device and try again"". I tried everything (including clear cash, data, reinstalling the app) but is just not working. Samsung said is nothing they can do and WhatsApp has to fix the issue. Update : after struggling a month with calling function, the app is working fine again."
"In recent update I mean the The perceives update In video call , if the other person is muted this call the mic is placed at the top corner and we are able to see the face of our loved ones clear ,but now in this update ""the person is muted is call "". Is seen in the middle and it is kinda disturbing . If you are able to change it .we could be happy for that . Thanx for the update 👍☺️"
"Dear Whatsapp, please give us option Just Like Telegram gives option of Logging out. We need pause and Whatsapp as well. it becomes too much sometimes. Your dual Feature becomes useless because if we turn on internet. Messages received on both whatsapp app will be turned to delivered and we will be obligated to answer. PS: would really appreciate if you add option sending advance messages which receiver may receive later on the time we choose. PS: Allow deleting chat and media by selecting years"
"I really love what the new update brought to WhatsApp. Fresh, crisp and well designed interface. But my issue comes with the fonts size on my status. I so loved the larger, clearer, readable fonts in the previous updates."
"I'd give it negative stars if I could. An absolute HORRENDOUS app. Whenever I take a picture it takes a whole year to load it (and it's far from being my phone's issue), when I send 2 or more pictures to someone it kicks me back to the picture picker even if the photos still send, and the PC app on the Windows Store is absolute dogwater. It is so unstable it's not even funny. It's just sad."
"Good that you're informing about the security code change. But it seems to happen very frequently. In large silent groups or personal chats, they fill the whole chats. Please provide an option to clear these messages to keep the chats clean. The only way I found is to star all the messages, clear the chat and unstar them again. But doesn't work for chats having large number of messages."
I'm using a phone with a pop up camera. Last time there's no issue when I want to minimize my screen to go to another app and still keep the video call on and the camera is still up. Now the camera keeps on going down for no reason. It's so annoying.
"Whatsapp is a good app for communication and it's easy but one thing is they're suck at is internet connection problem, like for example when I open an app that requires a strong connection it can, so that means my wifi is working, but when I want to try sending a simple message to someone it doesn't send! even when on group chat especially when doing a school project and I can't send my messages, same as posting status! Please fix this!"
my all data has been disappeared from cell phone. what is happening here Mr. whatsapp. please fix it as soon as possible. all status has been also disappeared after few moments later. ans aslo show ans errors as my photo has not been exist in mobile. so please also fix this issue is all disappeared data which has been I think crupted by whatsapp been recovered by me though whatsapp backup process. this is really very disappointed for me and I think this issue has been shortlisted by you.
WhatsApp is not showing call when phone is locked. Person who is calling see 'calling' not 'ringing'. And if is connected it takes too long to connect more than 40 seconds. This started recently. Earlier it was working smoothly.
"Remove the image compression. Often I send pictures or long screenshots containing text and my friends cannot see the text because of quality compression in Whatsapp. When I reached you via email, You replied, 'To avoid low quality profile pictures, we suggest using an image with height and width of at least 192 pixels.' A user don't have to check all those criteria before sending image. Just remove the image compression and there will be no problem. Also, add feature to hide online status."
"Like a few people have mentioned, since the last update, I am not able to attach photos from within WhatsApp. I have to come out of WhatsApp and go to my photo gallery and attach photos from there. Which is really annoying and time consuming. It was much easier before. Can this feature be restored please."
The issue I have is the notification. There is no more pop up messages anymore. It makes me loose so much messages to read and replied on time. Even calls don't appear again except through sound which I have to go to the app before seeing the call. This really affecting. Pls fix! Especially the pop up.
"Not fully compatible with recent android updates. Unable to send recent photos from within the app, anything newer than 2 hours just isn't seen. Have to share the photos from my phones gallery which takes significantly longer and is a hassle."
"IMPORTANT PROBLEM TO FIX:- The App was fine until the recent update. After that, while doing a video call especially via Bluetooth headset, the call is getting disconnected automatically. The mic and audio during the call also gets canceled at sometimes. It's been a real headache, since i was regularly using whatsapp video calls. A lot of people are facing this same problem after the recent update. Please fix this glitch in the next update and provide it as soon as possible. FIX IT SOON. IMP‼"
"I just got a WhatsApp call some time ago, while my phone was locked, but the phone showed no pop-up that would allow me to take the call, although the phone was ringing. After a lot of searching I realized the call was not a regular phone call, but on WhatsApp."
"Whatsapp is great. Perfect with many features. I would love it if it had some snapchat features though. I would love to do streaks on whatsapp and see whos your friends and best friends. Its a great app but with streaks would be perfect :) EDIT: I can see whatsapp has added a bitmoji type thing. So happy your acknowledging my feedback, and would definitely change my review to 5* if there were streaks :D"
"I gave 4 stars, because my WhatsApp is doing strange things. I will set my preferred notification, and sometimes on a reboot or power off that notification does not stay as I set it. I also have to customise every contact or I get a very soft notification. Why I didn't know. As I use WhatsApp on a daily basis."
I don't like not being able to auto-save photos to gallery when disappearing messages is turned on. I only want the conversation to disappear in WhatsApp. At least I wish I could save/share multiple selected photos at once.
Notification doesn't work since the latest Android upgrade (version 13) and I have to click into the app from time to time to see if there is new messages which is very annoying and this delays me from getting messages .... HELP!
"It's great to use view once photos or videos feature as a private privacy policy, but there's a flaw and I want to mention it here. The view once icon is still seen on receiver screen,  the view once icon SHOULD BE ONLY SEEN on sender screen, why? Because the receiver will always be ready to screen shot (it's not possible now, which is great) or screen record what they're going to see if they see view once icon on their screen. Please make this possible in the future update. Thank you."
"Was great untill the last update. On Android, you are unable to see recent images or videos and send them direcrly through whatsapp chat. You have to go to gallery, select them and then send. Please fix this issue, it's horrible and inconvenient."
I am using this app for years and this is sooo gud compared too other IM apps/webs ....i like rarely had any problems with this over the years but overall it is soo nice...and now it has more feature which makes it even easier to do conference calls and all.... Sometimes some of my documents doesn't download..rarely happened So i'll let it go...it helps me a lot though....
"I really like watsapp for it's features but when it comes to sharing photos or videos, it disappoint us by decreasing it's resolution. So, it would be better if watsapp consider this and enable us to share original quality photos and videos directly, without sending it as doc file."
Was really good before but recent updates have made sharing images randomly difficult. When I click to send a pic it no longer shows my camera roll or recent screenshots - only images people have sent me on WhatsApp. I have to go to my gallery and individually share images from there.
"Edited to include: I can't get notifications that I have messages . It literally pops up and says ""Popup notifications are no longer available in your version of Android"" Really?? What is going on with this app, does the app need an update to keep up with the new phones?? I have a Galaxy S22. Used to be a great app but I suddenly can't watch or send videos and their customer service sucks. I've cecked all my settings and they seem fine.... 🤯😖"
"I have used this for a couple of years now, and there was no issue. Now, they keep blocking my number and i have not do anything wrong. I request for a review, so they check my chats and see if i am violating any code. When they restore my account, it gets blocked again. This is very annoying and i would like Whatsapp to solve the issue."
"The application is giving me problem. After you have installed...it refuse to open and I have try several times to open still it is not open, this problem is happening to me after I have change to a new phone 😭I don't know what is causing that. I am still my best if there will a way out to fix this issues. .......I will be very grateful if something can be done about about it..is an urgent issues if something can be done about it to solve this problem. I think apart from that there is nothing"
"The new update doesn't bring up my keyboard when I want swipe right to reply a message, that's regression. Can we have the option of selecting particular chats that we want backed up to our Google drive. The disappearing chats too, I want it to be able to select the chats I want it to be for. Apart from that it's a great app.....the updates are nice and really helpful"
"When I'm trying to send images/status there would be displayed 2 same image, the real one and the thumbnail. I tried to erase the thumbnail ones from my file manager but it would only erase the ""image display"" like there are ""unavailable image"" displayed but ""it's not exist"" if you know what i mean, i hope this bug will be fixed soon"
"Great app. Please if one deletes a message, just delete the message and leave it at that. That "" you deleted this message"" still showing in the background is so annoying. It is not so on similar apps. Kindly work on that."
"Biggest problem is that the more media you have in the chat, more time it takes to load media/files section. Telegram loads it almost instantaneously. Also it would be nice to store (encrypted) media on the cloud storage without consuming storage space on the phone. Also have Issues with chat not automatically scrolling down, and suddenly jumping way up when scrolling up."
"The app has changed. Messages stay on top with last person spoken to, even if chat is deleted. When I delete a deleted message, a black bar comes up at the bottom that says ""undo"" just in the way. No need for it. Please change back to usual app."
"I really don't like the new update which forces us to view people's statuses when only trying to view their profile picture. I tend to view people's profile pictures a lot as we text and now requiring extra clicks is so inconvenient for statuses which have a whole dedicated tab, at least allow the option to disable or enable the new feature."
I am giving it one star because I can't get rid of the annoying messaging dialog that pops out on my screen a thousand times a day. It is unacceptable that I can't turn off this feature. I hate being distracted everytime someone sends me a message !!!
"Backup needs improvement, backing up either encrypted or not, takes HOURS. I will sit by my router literally for best connectivity with 1 Gbps fiber line and still take hours. I think a main initial 11gb backup is ok, but every subsequent backup take just as long. I wonder if there are data loss or corruption with the backup data and impact the WhatsApp backup feature. It's pretty messed up and time wasting."
"Whatsapp is the best official apk for sharing photos, videos, documents and much more. It gives you complete security when you talk with someone. It's video call and phone calls are really good because you can make a call from one country to another country without any cost (only mobile data required). You can chat secure, call secure and a lot of things are secured 🛡️"
"Communicating with friends is made easier than ever in recording and writing. Thanks to the creator.I like the way of recording than texting cause you can listen to a friend's melodious voice.Still we do go for pics that show up our curvaceous and bootylious bodies, but the bad part is when one wants to update . It some times disturbing but all in all its good."
"Using about 8 years now I think? It works well and is a quick way to connect to friends online or by messaging. I talked with friends in the USA, Mexico, Costa Rica, here in Colombia and Portugal and Albania. Good services and seems to find anyone with the app that has their own contact info in contacts."
"Hello, the latest update with the Avatar feature is not working for me. I made my avatar and saved it, and it is viewable for me in my account settings and I'm able to utilise the edit option. But not once since I made my first Avatar have the stickers loaded. The Avatar tab is visible in the emoji-gif-sticker panel, but they're not visible to me in the tab. Please advise, thanks."
"First of all, when somebody change to a new mobile phone, the back-up & restore is disgusting. Whatsapp want our google account access, thats is wrong on its part itself. Secondly, even if we back-up all our data to google drive, it doesnot restore things properly, never. Most of images, videos & audios are not recognised they are shown to be downloaded again. And during the shofting process, most of the new unread messages are gone away. Pretty annoying. And there are yet many more issues."
Try this if your stuck keeping your Christmas photos. Set this application timer too off. Then find your downloaded photos in Google photo's. Switch on back up as it will send your photos too your other phone as well. If you ave more than 1 phone. Then add them too your blue lockbox for safe keeping forever. Messages seem too AVE been fixed just in time for Christmas day 🎅⛄🎂🎈🎊🎉🎄😀👍 or it was just a annoying little🐞 that was causing all the problems over the past year 😠😡 True source 😀
"My chat history cannot restore. There's so much important things I've shared with friends including job task. I already uninstall and then install again just to do back up thing but the conversation just starting from today. Which means a lot things Ive lost. Please give the priority to chat history and back up files,etc."
"The App is fantastic but I have one suggestions. If you can add one more feature, which will allow you to schedule message and send. This will be great feature to add with upcoming updates."
"Won't allow me to send messages to existing contacts anymore on the 2nd installed version on my Samsung phones. I can't find anyone on the 2nd app unless I unistall, delete data, reinstall and re-verify numbers again, switching back and forth. The primary app reads contacts. The 2nd one won't. Terrible if you use multiple numbers like me."
"I'm so upset that it has these moments of not downloading content and now it's just gotten worse. if this isn't fixed, I'm uninstalling....and the call quality is not great. Now I'm having an issue with the app constantly asking me about backup frequency and changing my settings every time I close it. Whatever bug that is, it's annoying as hell."
With the new update I lost the ability to choose photos from gallery to attach to WhatsApp as many here has complained. I had to go out from Whatsapp and opened gallery instead in order to do so which works but rather tiresome as we were able to do this directly from Whatsapp before. Please fix it and bring back the function.
"I got blocked for spamming and had to register an entirely new number. Almost lost business. This is completely ridiculous!!! Had that number using for years and I don't send broadcast messages so I dont know how their investigations led to me being guilty of spamming. Update: I changed my number and woke up at 6 am only to see that my ""number is no longer registered"". Is this happening to anyone else?"
Samsung S20FE Please fix the notification glitch. They either show and don't go away after reading messages/backup is complete or they don't show at all. Messages/calls also don't come through/deliver when I'm not in the app (even on WIFI). I've missed some time sensitive communications due to this. PLEASE FIX Phone is set to show all notifications.
"WhatsApp has met all the expectations for social media communication except for the aspect of media quality. WhatsApp automatically reduces picture and video quality drastically when shared and it's quite unpleasant and inconvenient. This problem has lingered for years and despite the updates and new features to the app, this problem has persisted. WhatsApp would have been excellent if not for this issue. Please FIX THIS."
New update with green ring around profile photo is irrelevant. I don't find it useful. There's already a section for status there's no need to put in on profile photos. Kindly find a way for users like myself who don't find this useful to have it removed.
"The latest update in Whatsapp is HORRIBLE! The whole gallery is meased up. Only certain images/videos pop up in ""recent files"" when you either want to send an image/video or upload a status. You cannot select multiple images to upload into status from gallery, so using your status update to market goods is taking way more time than usual. I am dissapointed and frustrated. This is NOT a functional update, it does NOT increase user experience in a good way!"
"This app wouldn't be so bad if it didn't insist on taking over every aspect of your phone. I linked my contacts for one minute and now my contacts' photos won't show up, even after I've unlinked them. Whatsapp is a horrendous disease for your phone, I'd recommend using a real social media app for texts and calls instead."
"This app makes it fun and easy to communicate with my family. For example, if I don't know how to reply, I could just send a sticker! Speaking of stickers, I got a new hobby of making whatsapp stickers. Yes, unknown contacts are still able to message me even though I put ""contacts only"" in the settings, but I still recommend downloading whatsapp! :)"
Whatsapp should add the feature to download certain types of media files from certain groups. There are times when I don't need to download any media files from some group while needing in others. I can't stop downloading unnecessary data from groups that have less priority.
"Whatsapp is the best messenger that I know, but there is still stuff you need to fix. After the last update, there are some things you have to fix. When I try to send a video or a photo, it brings me not all of my photos it brings only one piece of my gallery, and there is no way to find my other pictures and files."
Don't see the point of disabling screenshots altogether in disappearing photos. Atleast allow the user to toggle it off for themselves if they don't mind their photos being screenshotted. Or allow it on a per photo basis. The point of disappearing photos was to not clutter the storage and save only what was needed (by taking screenshots). This completely removes the benefit and reduces it's usecases to extremely few. Please allow users to toggle it off for their photos.
This version is not good because it limits some features to be used even can not allow sharing of large video to maximum 2.5 minutes and documents which exceeds 17mb Also on massages it doesn't update them when sent and even deleted to the time of the current massage which makes it hard to trace the time when the last text occured.
"Great chatting app but has bugs. (1) On voice recordings, some messages start midway or skip certain parts of the voice messages when playing them, and (2) the app abruptly scrolls up randomly in a conversation which is a nuisance."
"Support is poor. After I upgraded my phone to Android 13, WhatsApp has an issue with video calls where the sound cuts out for me and the recipient. When I end the call and close WhatsApp, the microphone indicator shows that WhatsApp is still using the microphone and I have to specifically disable the microphone to stop it. I tried uninstalling the app, and reinstalling. Still happens. I wiped the partition cache of my phone. Still happens. I have contacted WhatsApp support, no help so far!"
"Just ....... love it..... In poll option, bug need to fix. 1) Not to choose more than one option 2) Avoid change of option 3) During poll, the result should be visible only to person who create the poll question not to the group members. Otherwise intermediate result may motivate others. 4) Option to share the final result after closing poll option. Thank you"
"A lot of important work remains to be done. Like view delete messages, hide personal messages, lock personal messages, put gift cover page on top of messages (like Instagram). Edit option, The world is moving a lot, man, a lot of changes should be made today. I agree the app is good. But how to hold on to the same thing for a long time. Change is human development. Live not ahead but at least live with. I think messages can be sent from anywhere. So I didn't like this app very much."
"In the new avatar feature, it will be easy for the user if gender characteristics are seperated. Both male and female options are under same option. And also it is taking time to display when we keep on opening each and every feature"
"Best app for chatting or share information, photos, documents and videos but there have one problem when shareing a photo from gallery photos quality is very poor on WhatsApp. So, i want to say that please reduce the shareing photos and videos quality 🙏. Please fix this problem as soon as possible 🙏. I think all over users those are using WhatsApp those are facing this photos quality problem 🌝. Neither your aap should very useful for our people's. ❤️‍🔥"
"Gallery photos no longer show when you click to send a media attachment. It only shows Whatsapp photos/GIFs/videos. You have to click the three dots, choose gallery and even then you can only send one image at a time. Truly terrible update!"
"Not sure what has happened but whatsapp has been very stupid lately,attaching pictures have become difficult. Not all folders show up, you have to browse tremendously. Messages don't load as quick, some stupid update has been done and I hate it"
"The ""loudspeaker/speakerphone"" no longer works for WhatsApp video calls. It only plays through standard earpiece audio, which is very impractical for video calls. This is frustrating, because it worked fine up until recently. There is no way to change it in settings or during the call. The problem ONLY occurs in WhatsApp. 🤷‍♂️"
"Whose idea was it to automatically download pictures people send? And whose idea was it to not have a universal setting to turn that off, meaning you have to turn it off in every single conversation and thread. And furthermore, whose idea was it to not date the photos that are downloaded. I have to scroll to the bottom of my gallery to find them."
"I HAVE FOUND A BUG............ If we are in a group video call and than pin a person video call by tapping on it for some time . There comes two option (mute and message) If we tap mute option, the person is muted(ie. his owns mic is muted without his permission) not only for mine but for all the persons present in call. This is against his PRIVACY. It's SOLUTION is that if we mute a person than he should be muted only for mine not for all persons in call. Like Google Meet."
Something has happened in a recent update and now attaching photos is complicated and tedious. Also only one image can be attached at a time and no message can be attached to the image. Please sort it out and put it back as it was
"This app is great for texting and calling someone! And people! This app is not such of a waste but.. I gave this 3 stars because i dont like how this app is allowed to say anything and bad words here... My friend doesnt watch his language and she always say bad words and thinks its funny... Maybe if u could add if someone says a bad word but it doesnt get send because of the bad word maybe! But the app is still good otherwise, 3 stars"
"I (and others, clearly) have experienced troubles with attaching media from my gallery since last update: it does not recognize my own media and doesn't show it as a option when I try to select. Instead I need to take a detour ( ... option upper right corner) and even then I can only select 1 file at the time. It's a huge hassle"
"The latest update isn't very good, the camera app doesn't recognize the phone's media, especially when it comes to uploading the desired photo, instead it displays it on its own (unnecessary random photo). This update is completely useless and please fix it asap"
"In ""attachments"" all photos and videos are not available. Only those shared and received within WhatsApp are receivable. This is veri irritating. I want all the media, my screenshots etc on attachment option. Currently I open my gallery, select pictures, and then share it to WhatsApp."
"It's been a beautiful experience, but do something about the Media compression when uploading. There should be a setting where we decide if we want to upload in high resolution or less. It reduces media quality to the worst possible outcome especially when you're uploading a higher quality media."
"Never receive the verifying code via SMS, and the waiting time for the only available verifying code via a call is so long and bugy, especially when it failed to call, you have to wait for 1, 2...more hours for the next trying, which has seriously affects the normal use after device system reinstallation. Verification asks for a phone number that threatens personal information security. One account can only log in to one device. Stupid design!!!"
"Wow this app is the best thing that a person could have but there is this one issue that I think happens to other people but I'm not sure but anyways like we all love voice messages right? So when I try to use it and when I send it for some reason the voice message shows 1 sec and when u tap on it, it doesn't work and it won't say anything about what I said but please fix this issue because if I wanna type a long message but then I don't wanna type so I can use voice message so please fix this😭"
Is whatsapp stupid to use phone numbers for registration instead of normal registration and do a user name ? Even there is an option to change phone number but some people not checking properly and texting to the same old number which has been given to some unknown person by simcard companies. It's super confusing. I travel lot of countries and it's very difficult for me and I believe lots of people have this same problem. Why WhatsApp can't do with user names ? Expecting changes soon 🔜
"After the recent update, unable to attach multiple pictures. Also, photo view is different. Have to click so many steps know order to get to see screenshots or camera folder.. pls return back. Totally not user friendly."
Nope!! Absolutely not! Why did WhatsApp reduce the text size on the Status Text option? The small text size is absolutely horrifying and you cannot accomplish much with it! You have to squint to read the text... Jeez...
What is wrong with what app new version everytime I try to read státus it appears black with only audio. And the worst thing is when we even turn off the screen light the státus audio is still playing.......dear what app team please reinstate the old version of what app we don't need your short functioning updated version. 👎
Edit: Anyone having this problem check your WhatsApp permissions for photos. They appear to be disabled. Please fix how the photos are pulled in. Google Photos is no longer there by default and you have to switch to it everytime you want to send a picture.
Worked fine for years but recently having problems. Can't send photos from my phone. There seems to be a random order to which photos I can use. I spent minutes scrolling looking for the photo I want to send and can't find it anywhere
WhatsApp gallery missing problem SOLVED I made a video on how to activate your gallery so you can access it with just one click instead of going to the top 3 buttons to find it. Go to your YouTube app and search @victoriamoyo (that's my YouTube Channel handle) for the video. Please like and share the video if you found it helpful. Happy New Year Everyone!!
Hi Whatsapp! There is a problem in Whatsapp Web. I think you need to add a collapsible button in web to hide chats. Since everything I want to split the browser's window it causes problem like I can only see the half of the messages. Kindly improve it. Thanks
"Been using WhatsApp for years now, and it's my first time facing any inconvenience at all. I don't get notified for my calls because it is “silenced by Do Not Disturb”. I don't recall turning such a thing on, and I tried everything to solve this but failed even though the app has permission for calls and notification. This is really frustrating, so it would be great if someone can tell me how to fix this. Thank you."
"What a miserable user experience. I can no longer attach more than one image from my gallery, it can't find most of the images on my phone for some reason, the backup function stopped working months ago, and good luck finding answers or getting support. Another helpful product ruined by greed and laziness."
"I do not use it often. I have found it useful for transcription of messages. It has a good layout, easy to use and understand. Many options for privacy, cybersecurity, and accessibility. I am still unsure of charges, but since it states that it is free, I will assume so. Thanks to Metaverse and contributors for all the hard work and continuing updates. You are all amazing."
"All goin well, can you please add the driving mode or many others in one click as at times I use have to answer the message which I don't want to. It will be a great addition to curb the accidents and to know others about bthe driving status as well. Looking forward"
WhatsApp must bring the feature of sending highest quality photos (or it should be sent in original size) we want WhatsApp not to damage the pixels of our photos and also to bring a feature of locking the chat so that other person couldn't screenshot our chat. Hoping to bring these positive changes. Thank you
"The new feature is ONE TIME OPEN PHOTO is totally useless , because sender send the photo and receiver open it and take screenshot of this photo. But the sender doesn't know about it !! So where is the privacy in new feature 👎🏼"
"I have so many problems in while using WhatsApp, messages are late coming, calls and video calls can't eagerly accepted. While open the WhatsApp, again again restore option pop up is open, i clicked the restored the option, WhatsApp have couldn't open. Solve this issue"
"It's great app in general. It worked perfect until the last update. Now when l'm trying to attach a photo from my phone it`s only shows the WhatsApp photos, won't show camera gallery photos or screenshots . Now to attach multiple photos I actually have to go into my photos app and share to WhatsApp. Update, Fixed - Ther reason for not being able to send pictures from the camera folder is because update removed permissions for ""photos videos"" just go to app settings and add permission."
"First of all, Happy New year. I am very happy with what'sapp and it's features. A suggestion for new feature would be best gift from me. I would like to wish happy new year to my family and friends exactly at 12 o'clock, but I can't stay awake late night. So there arises a need of new feature ""message on time"" in which I can readily type message which will be sent on time to the receiver. Once wish you a happy 😊 🆕 Year."
"This recent update that allows us to view one's status by clicking their dp is honestly annoying, like.. I'd be interested on the DP..!!..i know where to go if i wanna view their status. And please add a feature that allows me to block/disable receiving whatsapp calls"
"WhatsApp from Meta is currently getting out of hands, way buggy with the newly introduced features which comes with the update. Please kindly look into the features before pushing it here. Kinda hell lot of issues with this update and it's somehow moving from a Messaging App to Social Media App. Too bad."
"Nice app. But the latest update is weird, if I am clicking on a anyone's dp who has posted a status then it atomatically shows the status of that person, and If I want to see anyone's dp then I have to go inside that contact and then tap on the picture and then it will show a pop up box after that I have to choose whether I want to see the status or dp, so its a long process for watching dp. So this the only thing I don't like. Otherwise every thing else is fine."
Pls fix the issue with the images... 😭 It's annoying when I want to share my recent pic fm my album but it won't show!!! There is now a choice between recent or video. Which doesn't show any recent photos taken.
"I am having problem with direct calling. Once someone send me the number via text, I was easily call them directly through normal calls and now I have to call only whatsApp calls. If I want to call normally, I have to copy number and go to call log and then paste and then I cancall, Which is very lengthy and hard. Please change it normal .. As it was before... Thanks"
What is going on with WhatsApp?? You cannot even change your profile picture! You can't upload a picture as a status the normal way because whatever pictures you took for the day doesn't appear in your gallery! I'm so confused. That's why I hate all these updates on apps that we are forced to do. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FIX THIS BECAUSE ITS A PROBLEM AND IM SURE IM SURE IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS COMPLAINT!!
"Same problem as others already described: I'm taking a picture, screenshot, video or screenshot video of something, then i want to send these images / videos but whatsapp doesn't even show them when i have to select the images. Restarting the App and phone doesnt change anything."
"I was having the same issue when attaching photos to send. I fixed this by going into phone settings, apps, WhatsApp and changing permissions. Photos and videos was in the 'not allowed' permissions. Change this to 'allowed' and it should fix the issue. I had to allow audio and music when i did this."
After the recent update I'm no longer able to view my media files in my Whatsapp recents or view all my media in the Whatsapp Gallery. I've never had issues with this app and this particular issue is a bit frustrating. Please fix soon.
"Facing severe issues with respect to chat history backup. Even after back up is done on drive, it is not being detected when we re install. And this is happening not just with one phone. Have tried it on multiple devices and receiving no backup found or unable to restore everytime. The whatsapp groups of devices are mixed whenever we try to transfer data. How can there be no customer service for such a widely used app?"
"Don't know why but when I upload statuses, either photos or videos, the quality is quite blurred. Checked my settings and best quality is checked for uploading of photos so I'm not sure what the problem is. Please fix. Thank you"
"Honestly my experience with WhatsApp hasn't been too good. Whenever I want to forward messages, it takes forever to load my chats and groups that I wanna forward messages to. I keep updating my WhatsApp everytime with the hope that this problem will get fixed but no. Still the same Please fix this ASAP 🙏"
"Not a terrible app, but also not the greatest. I always seem to have issues with phone calls through this app. I usually have calls on speaker, and the person claims they can't hear me on their end and during the call, I start hearing A LOT of static interference. Very annoying. I'm using a Moto G Power device with this app."
"Great app! Could you please add a checkbox for those who use cellular data under international roaming? I noticed that my phone does not perform a backup once the checkbox for cellular data is selected, mainly because I am using roaming all the time. In this case, it is only working when using wifi connection. Thanks!"
"WhatsApp backup and restore option is trash. I spent days backing up my information such as chats, pictures and etc, on my old phone, to be able to restore on my new phone. Even though, it appears to back it up, it did not. I've worked so hard and was extremely patient still nothing after multiple attempts, I gave up. This app is a fraud. Backup and restore data should be one of the top priority for WhatsApp."
"Honestly this is the top 5 social media apps to use. People who don't like this application need to update this app in their play store / app store or they need to buy a newer phone because this app works absolutely fantastic!!! Had no problems with it although I have once received a message from a unknown phone number that I didn't know saying ""it's your friend Lisa from college let's meet up again"" obviously if you get a text like this just block this stranger ASAP!!! Thank You WhatsApp bye."
"It's very useful but, whatsApp video call quality is totally worst lots of improvement needed. In video call voice & picture quality is poor. When the video call comes screen become blank . I recently update this app but, when I use WhatsApp call the call is cut automatically Pl. fix this."
"Simple, fast, quick and easy. Although, it doesn't have it's flaws here and there. For example, when you want to send an emoji it automatically sends you to stickers which can get annoying, but it's not that bad. Anyway 4 stars, until this little thing is solved (then I give a 5 star review)"
"Dear beloved WhatsApp. How do you do? Thank you for being so awesome, and my go-to real-time messenger app. Could you please do us all a favor? In the next upgrade, please include character numbering (like Instagram's caption entry) in the written status update, so that one's long epistles don't get cut off after posting because the user doesn't know the character limit when typing. It can be really frustrating when we type our heart out, only to see a portion of it later. With love, Me."
"The was perfect till the last update.. After the last update I'm having a lot of problems with this app, if I tap on someone's dp is showing status and you have to go through a long way just to see a dp.. If I delete some message that I sent today, it will still pin the chat to today list.. This app is been bothering now and I hate this latest new update.. Plz undone this 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️"
"Downgrading my review as I'm also frustrated by the issue others have reported about finding and attaching images from my phone, and how much less functional it is than before. Very clunky and a much poorer user experience. Please fix this and revert to how it used to behave."
"The one thing i hate about this app is that it refuses to use my phone's vibration settings for notifications and is locked into a primitive ""short, medium"" or ""long"" setting, the only other alternative being ""off"". My phone can do a billion interesting HD vibration patterns, all of which are quieter and less intrusive than even the ""short"" setting in WhatsApp, and all of which have no issues playing nice with my other apps. It's WhatsApp that is incompatible. Please bring this app into 2022."
"No option for notifications of any kind. If I have to open it forty seven times a day to see if someone has messaged me, really doesn't make it anything but incredibly inconvenient."
"I really love this app...And the improvement and upgrades made on it. It's really get more interesting....🤗🤗. If you don't mind, I would like to suggest that some more features be added to it.... Such as video record, where one can drop a face recording of him/herself jxt as we drop voice recordings...I guess this type of feature exist in telegram.... Thanks 🤗🤗"
Images sent to me in a chat no longer save to the whatsapp images folder in my gallery. I have to save each photo individually (takes forever). Please change back to how it was before where all images and videos automatically saved to gallery!
"Faced a small problem today. After deleting messages of a particular date, the chats doesn't go down. For example, if I have done chatting on 12th Dec and 20th Dec with a particular person, and I deleted the chats of 20th Dec, the chats still remains on top (with the other others done on 20th Dec) and doesn't go down. It's irritating that the chats doesn't remains in chronological order according to date and it also implies that we have deleted messages. Please fix this issue as soon as possible"
"I am having problems with not getting notifications through, it doest show on the icon that have unread messages. If you can help please tell me what is going on? I have made sure all my apps are up to date, I am getting other notifications, all the settings seem to be set correctly and still not working."
"After the update, photos from the gallery are not accessible to be send within the app. I have to go to my gallery, select the photo and press share via whatsapp to send the photo. Its frustrating. Please do something about it!"
"New version of WhatsApp on PC (from the Windows store) does not allow forwarding multiple messages, instead you have to do it one by one. Searching for peoples names for a new convo also doesn't work, and on a large screen the UI was made worse than before. Gotta wonder, why is this being developed backwards and made crappier than the version before."
"I have found an observation which can be an issue in this what's app version. Observation - On WhatsApp, from Contacts, if we click on the contact DP, DP zooms out. On clicking this zoomed DP, instead of showing the complete DP, the status set by the contact is displayed. This observation occurs only when such Contact has an active status. Kindly check on this observation if you think it's an issue."
"Update as of 30 October 2022: new update new glitches on the app with difficulty making calls, videos, attaching photos. The video call is not working the camera has no image for neither party, the sounds is terrible and the attachment of pictures is a hit or missed. This was after calling 3 different phone number with Android or Apple products in use. Hope the team gets to this soon and this is happening after the update and restart of the phone."
"WhatsApp was great for sending photos and we use it for work, but since the new update it's been so frustrating, having to go through and find the photos on my camera roll and only being able to select one at a time Please change it back!"
Whatsapp is very good but please create a add where you can store whataapp images videos and all imported info except to save it on the server. Because whatsapp take a lot of space on your phone. Example when i use my camera i can setup it to store my photos on the memory card. Whatsapp can't be setup to do that all whatsapp info is on the phone and takes up phone memory. Please technical guys of whatsapp.
"after updating there are many shortcomings, starting from unclear phone sounds and disturbed features a lot, please fix this because I use this for communication. How can my communication run well while the application has many deficiencies"
"When i post something on whats app status, the quality of that particular picture or video is being very low... Its becoming blur almost. This has to be fixed. I observed the same on other's mobiles also..."
I'm beginning to hate how the image compression is done thus loosing the quality of the image even after choosing to best best quality images from the app. It's a common problem with the long screenshot.
1. Unable to watch status privately. 2. Cannot change a viewed update to missed update. 3. Cannot use two accounts on one device. 4. Provides user's data. 5. Shows number of muted groups and includes them on chat label. 6. Doesn't show who has and who hasn't received my message in group. 7. Stores data only on phone. Doesn't allow to transfer data and read data from sd card in settings.
"Its an awesome application for daily use!! If we are far from friends we can meet them live on video calls. If we wanna send something: Status,Chats, Emojis and what not we think of can be sent to our close relatives/friends whom we miss. I love the new features but just one major problem that if we send a video of 3-4 minutes on Status we have to send the same video 5-6 times,as it only allows a video of 30 seconds. Or else the app is great!! 👍👍"
"Im giving it 3 stars for now because my friend keeps spam calling me, can yall make a feature to mute and automatically rejects a call from one contact only without blocking them, it will be a good thing to add since people can be really annoyed about spam calls but they dont want to block the number. Please make this feature come true."
"Serious issue: When replying from the status bar notification, it just hangs, with the spinny loading wheel. The responses are sent, but the quick reply popup stays (instead of disappearing automatically) and you have to manually dismiss it."
"Just great to be a member of WhatsApp family . It's an outstanding place to interact with friends , family n colleagues etc. Only thing that can be changed is letting 10 message sending option at a time . Otherwise excellent."
The recent update is the worst. Now you can't see all albums from phone on WhatsApp. Broadcast lists don't work (you can't find any pictures). The gallery is not available on one click and when you do go to the actual gallery you can select just one picture. Useless. Useless Useless
"Hey! I'm currently facing that the voice note and message i send is read and heard by the receiver but it's not shown that either it's delivered or seen by the receiver. No double ticks , no blue ticks! This update should be finished it's totally useless 🙄 It seems like we are some kind of text messages app not WhatsApp 😏 such a bOring function is this. It should be finished!"
"Status is not showing. Soon after the update, I can't download any media or documents from my DM. I can't even see the status updates of my contacts. Messaging experience had never been such miserable with WhatsApp. Please see to it at the earliest."
Sir please make the call option better. When the call logo is just touched then it directly connecting. It is one of the draw back of this app . When the call button is clicked ADD the conformation option that which confirms is the user wanting to call or not . The touching of the call button may be happened unintentionally. It causes for the big problems in the communication. This is not a review. It is my request.
It is very annoying that some media can't be sent to more than one person at a time if it was forwarded too many times. This doesn't make any sense. It is an app to share thing with friends. What's the point in making restrictions. Another annoying thing is that some of the sent media doesn't load and that's very frequent and it's happening too often with so many poeple. That wasn't the case before.
"After the latest update, I don't get notified of any messages. Even calls i can just hear ringing, nothing shows up unless i open WhatsApp. The weird thing is that WhatsApp business still works totally fine! This is horrible."
"After new samsung update, my photos wouldnt show. If youre having the same issue, go to the device settings, apps and permissions. My photos and video permissions was unchecked (was checked before the update). Allow permissions for photos and videos again. It should sort the issue out. Hope this helps a few people."
"As a user of WhatsApp , I have seen one of the new feature i.e. Poll Selection . This feature is not so useful. One can change their option as per the majority of voters . This feature is useless . It's is not baised at all. Another thing is we can select both of the option at same it . It's the major drawback of this Poll Feature . Not accurate as well as trustable at all . According to me , you should modify this feature so that it'll be helpful for others."
"Chats won't restore after changing to a new handset, my Google drive has been backed up on my old phone, verified my number and I was never asked to restore chats, I've tried reinstalling the app, I've signed out and signed back in and still nothing. Could someone from WhatsApp admin please contact me as I'm missing a lot of important messages."
"The new update is the worst. I try to open profile picture and it takes you to the status. If I am clicking profile picture, I need to see profile picture only and not the status. Don't destroy the WhatsApp because of non sense updates. You will loose customers because of updates that are totally stupid."
WhatsApp calls are now coming through adls though they are regular. What a terrible idea! Most calls are impossible to find and answer while the device is ringing. And that is only if it even rings.
"The back up on google drive never gets completed. Suddenly in the morning something goes wrong with data, as it says on the screen. Whatsapp tries to restore and it does restore a month old data. Why in the world there are multiple everyday versions are being stored in the internal memory of phone? What's the fuss? Can someone explain?"
"After sending a message, it'll show a couple check marks, meaning the message was read by the other person. But usually it's not accurate. Line is more accurate when it comes to message being read or not."
Whatsapp has been a helpful app thus far. I usually manage a lot of groups so the option to delete a message on a page as an admin has been helpful a lot since hacked accounts of members are used to post irrelevant info not related to the page. I was going to suggest this a while back I wish to suggest another update for groups. I want to be able to pin some announcement on the page so people are able to see it first-hand when they open the page or are alerted of a pinned message on the page.
"After the recent update, it's taking way too long to connect WhatsApp call and video call even having proper internet connection. Same goes with downloading any media or sending any texts, photos, videos."
"Recently I've noticed that in my lists of chats if I delete one msg or a missed call for example, that person's msg in my lists of all msgs from everyone doesn't move to the back of the line. I don't know if that makes sense but basically if I have 19 msgs from different people and they are all in order if when they were sent and I was to delete the latest msg from the last person that msgd me, he will still be at the top of my list of people who messaged me. Which is weird."
The fact is that the latest version is good because it can be registered on two phones but where the problem is the message don't sync so please work on that. It would be great if it was made like telegram where messages sync very fast please help on that
"If it is possible to give a NEGATIVE STAR i would. Been getting logged out constantly ""due to spam"" (explain , WhatsApp support worst ever) , when i tried to log back it takes forever, no verification code sent ,yet they claim multiple wrong attempts. You log back in after 24hr - 12hrs only to get logged out again in a few short hours and you keep repeating the same process over and over. FIX IT. Noticed in comments that this problem was common among my phone model users. Phone change needed?"
"Notifications are not popping up after the android update. Can't view the photos or videos received, can't send out, can't voice note. When I received WhatsApp call, it doesn't even show??"
"I don't like the new update where when I'm trying to view someone's profile photo it takes me straight to their status, now I have to go through the long process of viewing their profile and selecting view profile photo. It was efficient when you see the green circle and know click to view the new status but there's no need for click to take you to status if there isn't anything new just saying....."
Latest update makes sending images and videos impossible. I have to root through my gallery which I can't access directly any more and can send no more than one image at a time. Really rubbish update that needs fixing!
"Since the last update either statuses, videos, photos and even stickers take an eternity to load. And it's not the internet connection because other apps are working perfectly fine."
WhatsApp needs sorting! I can't send pictures from my camera roll anymore without a big faff or send multiple pictures at one time. The latest update has completely ruined it. WhatsApp has always been a favourite App until now.
I keep replacing my profile picture continuously after a couple of hours and this is getting awful and occasionally the names of my saved contacts disappears and it look like I didn't save the contacts on my device initially this is annoying I think they need to have a new update on this App
"I had a suggestion for you guys, Their is a option where directly i enter any phone no. And message them No problem i faced is, i need to save the number which irritating, especially when i just need to send him few photo or videos that's it, so, i has little suggestion to give us a option of direct message with Saving their number Just dialed their number and message them."
"Since a few days, I haven't been able to use WhatsApp normally. I'm not receiving any messages, they are delayed. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app again, and it fixes, but it doesn't last. P.S: I'm sorry if there's any mistakes in my review, im not a native speaker"
This is a good app but I want a feature I am in 8th standard and I was checking my group then I saw that my teacher sent some work I was rotating fig by more options button but i accidentally click on delete button and my work got deleted and now I can't recover it please add a feature so we can recover over notes etc.
The app is wonderful but I think it needs a bit of work concerning the colors at the status center...it could use a bit of creativity....also the archives need a bit of work to assist in hiding some contacts from the home screen
"It's 2022 and it has been 2 years since my last review, well I've discovered that the privacy features that were introduced ( view once on media files) the soon to be introduced ""view once"" text. BUT my biggest concern is that we're still NOT safe if WhatsApp still allows creepy apps like WhatsApp GB to invade those privacy settings!! WhatsApp MUST BLOCK ALL ACCESS from that creepy app, until then privacy is just a term to make us feel safe but we're NOT!."
"PLEASE REMOVE THE PHOTO/VIDEO FEATURES ONCE VIEW, IT'S VERY DISTURBING TO ME!!!! SO I CAN'T VIEW THE IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS THAT WERE SENT IN ONE VIEW, AND IF I CAN'T DELETE IT, PLEASE FEATURE ONCE VIEW CAN BE CAPTURE THE SCREEN BACK😭. HELP PLEASE!!! RETURN THE SCREEN CAPTURE FEATURE IN THE PHOTO/VIDEO FEATURE ONCE VIEW!!! BECAUSE I NEED A SCREEN SHATCH IF AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENT IS SENT AT A ONE VIEW FEATURE"
Like others since update it does not work properly with photos allowing you only to send 1. It's made it useless and might as well just send a sms. Considering uninstalling if it's not fixed quickly.
I lost all the data's and messages after updating the WhatsApp. Now notification is misbehaving in my notification bar. The notification capturing the whole screen and unable to get back from the screen.
I can no longer get popup notification. Always have to go into the app and seen my latest msgs. Tried everything in my settings and the only thing i can find is that it is no longer available on the version of Android!
"Please please rollback to the previous photo sharing experience! I now cannot share my most recent photos. Inexplicably,you have made it so I have to go out of the app, into my gallery to choose. Trying my best not to use WhatsApp at the moment but essential for work unfortunately."
"Basically what everyone else is saying: unable to send more than 1 photo at a time, unable to send videos completely as they just don't show up, and the gallery of phone must now be accessed through 5 more additional steps. Please fix asap"
"I loved Whatsapp and used it especially for the quality of sending photos. But after the last update, my app doesn't recognise any of my gallery pictures, so I can't send any. It is very annoying."
"I've been seeing people's settings and they have the ability to turn off their ""online"" visibility but this feature is yet to reflect on mine despite me updating to the latest update from playstore. Could you please enable this feature for me. I need it. If you don't do this in your next update, I'll rate this app lower and probably switch to Signal."
"This app is really good and helping in many ways. It's easy to be used by all. However, if the Inc. will add cartain features as like ONLINE TOAST for the contact online,it probably will be more interesting."
i hate whatsapp when someone calls up ... it just pops up again and again annoying the hell out. The ringtone also doesn't silent if i use the volume button. I use Samsung S9 i know maybe because its an old phone but still these should not be there in the first place.
"Really a good app for connecting with your friends, family, relatives, etc. This app have various features that are helpful for sending documents, videos, images, etc. A nice messenger app."
"comes out handy as many of my contacts use it. Problem is the phone memory gets full very quick and there is no option to configure the app to store media in the sd card, I cannot move files manually, as there is no access to media files from phone gallery. the option to configure storage would be very very helpful"
"Terrible experience while changing the phone from iOS to Android. Recently changed my phone and whatsapp is not able to verify phone number, I tried everything and installing multiple times but no result. Wrote to whatsapp help multiple times but they keep sending me automated responses, it has been more than 10 days and still the problem is unresolved. Terrible customer service !"
"Hi. I am facing a serious problem. Recently I've noticed an camera icon on my notification bar. When i click it it says, Camera used by WhatsApp. But when i try to video call someone. I can't see my own face but yes i can see the person i am calling. And i can't even use the camera because of it. Please fix this!"
"Sending photo function is totally fussy! Nowadays click on the camera icon to select photos will only show the photos that already been sent in WhatsApp but not the ones in any other folders in the gallery, esp the latest pics! Plus, been directing to the gallery which show the camera folder, it will only allow you to send one photo even though you choose to add photo, the last added photo is the only one you can send, totally nuisance! What happen to the setting here!"
They ruined a perfectly good app. Used to be able to easily send photos from the Gallery and now it's nearly impossible... Recent pictures don't show up anymore. Very disappointed
"I updated my phone to android 13, since then I can't see my photos and videos that is in my camera folder. Usually I click on the camera icon and all my photos and videos will show there, now only media that was sent via whatsapp shows there. If I click on the attachment icon, then on gallery, I only see folders for chats. I don't see my camera folder or any of the folders that is in my gallery. There is 3 dots in the upper right hand corner, I can go to gallery there, but no video in camera fol"
This app was good once upon a time. Got worse with each update. Even when messages move from one tick to two ticks it's no longer gone to blue or worded as seen. Developers take notes please.
"Hello. I opened my WhatsApp to see that all my chats are gone😭. I didn't tamper with it, or change my phone; when i entered my file manager, my WhatsApp data was still intact, but my chats and messages are not displaying 😭. What is wrong with the app. Reply or i will sue the company. Restore our messages. This is not the first time it has happened, i get some acquaintances telling me same of the app. I lost messages, I'm yet to read and process; business related especially. This is bad."
"The app is the best in everything. But I have a problem right now of not receiving messages when my data is on, rebooted the phone also. I have data but for some reason I'm not receiving my messages. It's frustrating because it is the most reliable means of communication, what happens if now I can't use that? I can log on Facebook right now but I am not receiving messages on Whatsapp. Business associates are calling me asking what's going on. I need to review that 5 star rate I gave."
Good A perfect way to get connected with friends and family Overall it's a positive contribution to the community and people love it well I can not describe the feeling it gives me to be connected to friends and family so easily We love the video and chats as well as the texting It would be almost impossible or very expensive to get these things without this apps In my opinion everyone should be grateful and thankful for the service. It has eliminated boundaries and brought friends and family in
"This app is really annoying as: it doesnt notify me of messages half of the time and sometimes i don't get them (even thought my wifi is on and is very good) unless i literally have the app open allllll the time. And whenever i'm on call, after a while, it just starts cutting out and the call ends and needs restarting. Why?? Also, why do my reviews keep disappearing? So stupid"
"I lost all of my WhatsApp photos and videos, years worth of memories. After filing a complaint with WhatsApps help center, all that i got was a very unhelpful automated message. Please do better. This is unacceptable."
"I love WhatsApp cz its easy to use & has many great features. But i recently installed dual WhatsApp and i noticed that not a single media shows up in my gallery or storage. I need to manually click on each photo/video and upload it to Google photos only then can I see them in my gallery.I have media visibility on, i have selected all media even for mobile data, restarted my phone and much more but nothing seems to work apart from manually uploading them on Google photos. Pls fix this."
"After the latest updates, while in WhatsApp call, playing any videos in any browser such as Chrome or Brave will not work because of WhatsApp call preventing any videos from playing by pausing the videos every seconds locking it on pause constantly. This is ridiculous, this never happened before and all of the sudden it happened. Please FIX this immediately."
"It was working fine till now but after recent update , whenever i try to send or forward the message the search option on forwarding screen become blank. So either we need to go back and try to forward again or scroll manually. Please fix this."
"The application was good until the recent update.. after updating, the new feature called ""Message yourself"" is actually not working properly and whenever i text myself and delete the texts, at the same time the display picture getting disappeared. I checked for several times and it's happened again n again. Kindly fix this issue."
"Ever since the 2 latest updates, I've noticed I'm not able to send any videos. It keeps telling me there's been an error to try another video and it's the same. I have a Samsung galaxy s22.."
"Only good for messageing family but otherwise I don't really use it and is very glitchy and would not use if there was emergancy and had to call a pearant also why do I need WiFi (mobile data) to message people like if I was dying I'm not gonna go ""Oh let me just wait for my data to turn on."" what if u don't have any left u want people to die why can't u do no WiFi ( mobile data) like messages on Samsung and probably on iPhone please fix this Thank you."
"Nice App. But there's something I hope developers can do it, it's to make accurate digital input for Status videos. For example a video 1 minute but I wanna add it accurately between 25 and 50 seconds through digital input instead of editing the Inaccurate editing bar which makes many of us angry.."
"The app has been an effective communicator . Keep up . However, personally, I wish the problem of disappearing msgs can be solved eg an option to archive up to 6 months then erase automatically after 3 reminders?"
"Sometimes if someone sends me a video, it doesn't get saved in my internal storage despite of the fact that I've made sure the WhatsApp setting to save to internal storage is on. It's irritating. Also I can't edit the polls. People are choosing multiple answers at the same time."
"After the recent updates, there are a few issues that are starting to pop up : 1. Video calls are consuming a lot of battery. 2. As soon as the participants increase over the call, the frame do not fit the participants appropriately anymore. 3. Last seen time stamps are inaccurate."
"the structure of the messages are so disorganized cuz when u delete the texts of a particular chat, it still stays on the top..which is v annoying..PLEASE PLEASE fix this and make it like how it was before..basically when u delete messages with a person n the last texts were few days before it is in the same order n not on the top"
I can only send one photo at a time and have to navigate through extra steps to my photo folder. Something isn't working properly in the latest update. Please fix this issue. Thanks.
"The WhatsApp team is doing good to make it more user friendly . There is one suggestion from side. Please provide a ""Saved Messages"" section in the chat just like Telegram ; so that the user can put some text, reminders, pics, files, docs etc. in it for quick access rather than sending them to any of their friends. I used to send such files to one of my WhatsApp contact who had blocked me 😂😂.. because it didn't get delivered 😝 But now I really feel the need of ""Saved Messages"" section."
"I used to be able to send voice notes but now I cant. I can receive them and listen to them. When I press and hold the mic it just says recorder can not be set up right now try again later. This has been going on for over a year and no one has fixed it and say that it is a phone issue which it is not because voice recording works in every other app (Instagram, Snapchat etc) all permissions are granted, I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app many times and cleared the cache. Very frustrating"
There needs to be a way where people who aren't in your contacts can't contact you. It would be good if you confirmed a request THEN they could message. Need a way to appear offline. Update: i deleted whatsapp. It sucks and is one step away from a dystopian nightmare Update: i reinstalled and it's better how that i can appear offline and that there are avatars.
It's a very nice App and easy to use. Please work on the part that notifies someone of deleted file or text and the view once too. It has to be a surprise else the recipient will take a screen recording before opening what you sent. And please include the number of times your status is being viewed by one particular person. Would definitely give this amazing app a 5 star ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"I think everyone will appreciate an option to edit any misspelled message like iMessage in iOS16. The message will be marked as edited and even there will be an option to see the real message. Another third-party app Telegram has that feature, Whatsapp is everyone's favorite app, so I'm begging Whatsapp team, please add the feature."
"There should be an option to delete a message already read by someone. Cause sometimes by mistake some messages get sent unintentionally and even though those are read by that individual, those messages still make the conversation awkward."
"Edit: I take back my 3 * - I can't even post a photo status, it shows up blurry to others! Usually would be a 5 * but like so many others have said, since the latest update, the gallery attachments don't work properly now with android (Samsung) & now not even photo status. Previously couldn't send edited videos with sound. Why do these things keep happening?! Can this get fixed please WhatsApp?"
"A lot needs to be fixed, you mute the video sending to your status but still has sound when it's posted, also i can't crop the videos I'm posting to my status why??you think it's crops but starts from start when it's posted, that's very frustrating"
"Why has no one from What's App responded to all the complaints about not being able to upload pics from phone camera/gallery to send on Android?? I, too, am having this issue after over 6 years use of no issues. I would gladly rate this app 5 stars, but this latest glitch since the end of November is extremely frustrating. This is how I stay in contact with family overseas and not being able to easily access my photos and send multiple at a time is very, very disappointing! PLEASE FIX the ISSUE!"
The last versions of whatsapp are actually taking away the originality and utility of this app. I cant see if people are online or not. its creating misunderstanding. The shared photos are gone after reinstalling the app even though i had made backups. New messages disappear while the app was reinstalled etcetc....bottom line Its really disappointing using WHATSAPP now a days.
"If you have given the option to upload media file in high quality then why always we get worst quality when uploading status of images or video. I humble request to you make this setting useful,and update with a new features for people. Who can share images or videos in good quality. And stop us to go from mod version of whatsapp."
"Very bad experience on the app. I am using this app because I have been forced to use this app literally. Nowadays it's one of the vital social media platforms from schools to offices. What I found is that all of a sudden, one of my very important chat's entire message history got deleted! How is that possible? It's a massive loss to me."
"I like using Whatsapp a lot... Last week i changed my phone so i wanted to login into my WhatsApp account on my new phone... It goes very well in the beginning but when it reaches the ""initializing... Please wait a moment"" page, it goes back to the profile info page after a long period of loading and then provides a message saying ""unable to connect, please try again later."" I thought the fault was from my internet connection so i used a much better on but still I've not been able to login."
"most of the time it is great and my favorite app.for messages. however i have to force stop the app frequently, like 7 times daily! for my stickers to work and had to uninstall it and reinstall it recently to be able to send vids again. update- had the same issue again 3 weeks later too"
This is a very good app but I have a few complaints one is that I wish whatsapp could support status videos over 30 seconds or even a minute. Also I wish we had free mode like on facebook for at least texting. Another thing I'd like is the ability to post voicenotes with no length limit on status
"1. cant paste images 2. when i try to upload a file aight, and i press ""upload file"", pick an .mp3 file it treats it as a document (without preview) cuz i didnt specifically press ""upload audio"" 3. more support for file types. go take a look at discord, they actually managed to do that 💀 also can i react with more than one emoji? damn, what a shame this app is, i rly rly dont get why so many ppl use it, unfortunately im forced to use it bcuz of that reason, damn i hate wa bruh 💀 peace."
"The Whatsapp product team needs to work on picture and video quality after they are uploaded to whatsapp statuses. It is very discouraging to see your picture quality drastically reduced. In this wayz I'm not sure this would help businesses or creatives that want to advertise or post visual-related works. Let's work on this. For other features, they have been great all along. Big ups!"
I can't use it because everytime I try to receive a sms with the code it says you tried many times which is not true. Someone else is trying to take over the account and even though I own and use the simcard still I can't use watsapp on this number. One month I have been trying to email the customer service the errors and shared screenshots but nothing has changed. They just don't want to help. Zero for customer service.
"Actually watsap app has been and is still one of the best communication app, though I do love it if the creators of the app include a scrolling bar, so as to easily visit the old messages and also sometimes you want to block someone but you don't want them to know, so if possible make it invisible to the blocked person that he or she is blocked. This are my suggestion but presently watsap is so superb and I am enjoying it and I wish to enjoy it in future too. Thanks!"
"The most garbage fluke, my data is on, every other app functions on the network, WhatsApp neither sending messages, downloading statuses, receiving messages, I had to test out whether internet was working with other apps, most idiotic malfunctions when you actually need it to work"
"Ever since i last updated my whatsapp, there are some bugs. For example it glitches and doesnt show if my message have been delivered unless i close the chat and re open it. Or if i'm on a call and the person doesn't respond and i call back, the camera freezes and it unfreezes unless i close the call. Each of your ""updates"" are just downgrades. Really disappointed of how WhatsApp have turned into. What is the use of this community thing? Why does my photos/videos compresses each time i send it?"
"I only use this as no one answers texts anymore, as they prefer doing it on this app as it is 'free'. But for me, it has zapped my 8gb internet usage on my phone several times. I was once in the gym for one hour after topping up my phone, I came out to find that all my internet had been used due to this app downloading pictures/videos off messages in the background. I then figured out how to turn off the the stupid auto download of the pictures/videos, which isn't said when first using the app."
"Sometimes all of sudden WhatsApp server doesn't works properly, I mean my internet connection is working properly but then too When I send a message to someone, the message doesn't send. And that freaks me out !! Suppose if you want to have some important conversation and you prefer WhatsApp and WhatsApp does this, what will be your decision..?"
"First of all, this app has some serious issues with backup, at first backup takes very long time than expected even after good internet connection and due to that sometimes it says that it couldn't backup. Secondly, I didn't like that fact that backup schema is so much wasted here, for instance why customer has to backup everytime, why can't it be serverless like in telegram, please do learn from them. At last, kindly bring the option of pinning messages in group and channels."
As the app working is good but only one defect was found that when we delete a person message then after chat list was not showing based on the date list. It is showing the deleted person contact as a top list.previously when we delete anessage from one contact it will be removed and sorted based on the date of conversation now it's not working in Android users. Thank you
Latest update limits photo/video share. Hopefully they resolve soon. Update: If you want to share multiple pictures or videos. You must do it from your gallery. Select multiple pics or the video - use the share option - choose whatsapp App - select your contact you want to share and it will send like normal. This is the work around I found to share multiple pictures at once
"I think there's a Bug in the Software. If we delete the present days chat, earlier it uses to Que in with the previous Date. Now it stays in the present date and this confuses the user. Please check and correct it immediately. Never expected such a lag from this developer."
"I have a wish from whatsapp so i wish that All the features of WhatsApp are good, but if WhatsApp brings one more feature, it would be great and that feature is that like Facebook, it would be nice if there is an option to set songs, so that when we set the status,If we want to put a song in our photo or video, we can put it And the way we get the list of songs on Facebook, in the same way we get it here. So please make these changes in WhatsApp. Thank you"
"I've been using WhatsApp for years and overall, I love the app. Recently though, I've noticed a change to the voice note. You can't play it mid voice note anymore. It makes you listen to it all over again, which is annoying and doesn't make sense."
"I don't see why if you don't have the newest version of a phone you need to sacrifice receiving notifications. Twice now this app has stopped allowing me to receive notifications, claiming that the option is no longer available on my version of Android. Getting a new phone fixed it at first but that's not going to be an ongoing occurrence."
After having latest updated version.... what's app had lost its originality ......now it seems like clone of Instragram......it's not good...... every single thing(especially what's app) has its own unique style....why don't continue the same?????it's not good showing status at the place of profile
"Great App DEC 20, 2022 Not a Great App for me anymore Dec 19, 2022, I woke up to realise that my WhatsApp was reset to when I started using WhatsApp. Lost ALL chats and media. Haven't been able to restore backed up data because apparently was deleted from my Google drive. Still don't understand how this happened. Has been very frustrating and WhatsApp support has not been of any help. So I have changed my rating from a 5Star to a 1Star"
"find it a decent app but really don't have a use for it other then chatting to folks on a personal level, sharing images and videos from my content I've gathered and also like that it's another way to securely log in to other apps and for my device to use a secure password and to also help keep my passwords in check. problem is it doesn't desply your own whatsapp number for the end-user conducting the app to talk to other folks. has many features to change chats and group chats."
"What have you done?? The best thing about the app was the ease of adding photos and messages together. Now you have to go searching for photos. You can only send 1 at a time, and you can't add a message. Please sort this out"
"TERRIBLE , TIME TO UPDATE !! can't send photos through the app anymore, nor we can send multiple photos. It's been a while like this, and it's taking too much time to fix suxh a simple solution. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼"
"Messed up. 😡 They left everyone (even landline & toll-free numbers) in your Whatsapp phone book with an ""Invite a Friend"" link for each entry in your phonebook--Even if already listed as whatsapp users. Now cluttering the whatsapp contact list with this USELESS feature in the send a message screen. NO WAY to hide/remove. It's obvious the developers/owners are trying hard to get you to invite everyone to use whatsapp. Don't bother asking for help. Their auto responses don't help either. 👎"
"I love this app that allows me to co tact and keep in contact with people in other countries. The sound quality is fantastic, as if the person 10,000 miles away is sitting right next to you. Also, I have nit experienced any dropped calls this whole year! Also love the voice message system!"
"Sometimes I don't get messages as they are sent and they then come all at once and sometimes it doesn't notify me when i do get a text, regardless of my phone being on vibration or sound, it just comes in as if my phone is on silent."
I'd prefer the blurry version when someone paused it when videocall because if anything happen we can still recognize what are they doing especially if something happen like car accident or something else we can still recognize what happened even it's blurry.. please bring back the blurry version 😔
"Easily the worst app I've ever used. Meta claims that the chats are encrypted and your info is safe, but they can't keep your number safe from leaks or bots. I've gotten so many scam texts and calls, that even if I uninstall I get them on my actual line. Meta needs to fix this in a way similar to Telegram or Signal before bragging about security they don't have."
"Worst app!!! I tried the new feature end-to-end encryption password on chat backup, but while trying to restore the chat backup, whenever i enter the password everytime it shows ""something went wrong please try again later"". I contacted WhatsApp and sent a mail along with screenshot but got no solutio. Why you introduced this feature when you have no solution to this problem."
"Worst update ever. I can't send videos from my gallery anymore and when you want to send pictures from your gallery you have click on the three dots and go to your gallery separately instead of having acces to it immediately when you click on ""gallery"" in the chat. I'm so frustrated with how inefficient this update it, throw the whole app away"
"Hello WhatsApp LLC! It's a great app but you will get 5 stars from me after fixing following issue.. 1. Earlier when we used to upload status, the text was automatically center aligned which was good but now the text is left aligned even if we write in a right-to-left language. 2. There should be an option to edit status. Thank you."
LATEST UPDATE IS TERRIBLE. this is my worst experience since I've started using WhatsApp. it's been so bugged ever since the latest update; messages be sent and still be marked as 'unsent'. I literally have to close and reopen the app multiple times to view images sometimes or make sure my messages were actually sent.
Trying to send pics from a wedding and can only send one picture at a time and have to go thru multiple layers each time. Will take me forever to send pics using the app. Back to sending thru text. Going to delete app unless they can fix this. Very disappointed!!!
"For anyone struggling with the new update, you need to go into the app permissions and enable photos and videos as it no longer appears to have these since the latest update. Why the hell would I only want to send photos that someone else has previously sent me, instead of being able to send photos from my actual gallery?"
"No avatar settings as advertised. It's also a complete ball ache trying to upload photographs from your galleries as you used to be able. Now you have to come out of WhatsApp, go to your gallery and find a picture. You used to be able to access all your photos straight from the app."
"Hello I'm not the one that is complaining but recently since I upgraded my WhatsApp it has been freezing while having a conversation, suddenly there is no sound and then I must wait for the sound to come back on, or the screen on freezes before I can continue with my conversation all this its data and it is quite making me irritated i f always been happy with what's up so i don't know what is going on there i will see really appreciate it if you could keep into this matter for me."
"Regular calls and video calls keep dropping. There seems to be alot bugs with the app, as it shows that I am still in a call, but on the other person's end the call has ended. Also would like a screen share option, if possible."
"The only downside is while in group chat, if someone is sending the video and it has pass a few days, u can't view it anymore and hav to ask that person to send it. Unlike telegram it does not hav expire time so u can view whenever u like. Pls implement this function on the next update. Otherwise its sucks."
"Having issues when sending and receiving messages, not sending straight away regardless of mobile data or WiFi signal strength. Have to enable and disable airplane mode to get messages to send. WiFi seems to be worse not matter what speed of connection"
"FRUSTRATED, after phone updating all my images and videos turned blank, I can't download from pintrest anymore it shows downloaded but nothing appears keep on saying 'format is not supported' when you want to send images, nobody is able to help I tried everything, for new users please think carefully before you download this app, suddenly if I want to update I must pay R7,00pd??? Only reason I keep it on my phone is to get information"
"This app deserves -100 stars!!! Calls are never placed properly (everytime it shows ""calling"" and not ""ringing"", nothing wrong with my internet!), Can't see my pictures from the gallery anywhere. The app has become worse than before!!! Fix it!!!!!!!!"
I was not having any issue until the app had been updated from few days. I can't delete the conversation I don't want to see anymore. And I don't see any positive point of this update. Kindly bring back this thing to normal where one can delete whatever he/she wants. Hoping to see positive response
In recent update.. we can directly see the status on profile if someone has added newly status..but I have noticed one thing is that.. while visiting someone's profile & if that person has added some status..then at this situation we won't be able to see his/her dp.. instead it will directly jump to his/her status . That problem should be updated..
"Nice app! However, it would be great if one can easily edit a text posted on one's status especially when there's a typo. If there's a feature that allows one to correct typo after posting on one's status, I think it will greatly be of help."
"I've been having so many issues since the last update. From sending media files to connecting to Bluetooth headphones l, everything has become more tedious and there seems to be a lot of bugs on this update. Fix it please"
"I don't like this update... Please take it back to the former one....... The emojis that shows whenever you want to reply someone's status is not necessary, again when replying someone's status on game mode you won't be able to see what you are typing........... Another problem is still status....... When playing music with an output device (speaker) or input device (earbuds) despite the fact that your phone is still on silent mode, the status disrupt the music and is really terrible"
"Please remove the "" muted this call"" text from middle of the screen. It was in the corner of the screen before recent update. Thats looking very bad. You should improve user experience with the update don't ruin the user experience."
"Please help, I recently discovered a glitch. I made a sticker in sticker maker and put it in a photo but then i thought it looked weird so I deleted the sticker pack. However, when I go to add other stickers, the recent same sticker just stayed in the same spot in the recents place and it is stuck there. Please help to stop this glitch, the stuck sticker feels weird. A suggestion is to make it possible to delete some recent stickers in the photo editing menu. Will raise the rating, ty!"
"Every once in a while the app crashes and then I can't open it. Very frustrating. When it first did it, I uninstalled and reinstalled to get it to work. But after trying that again it won't work any longer."
"Has become frustrating. Why cant I attach multiple images to messages anymore? Also, when selecting the gallery from the message attachments, the first thing that opens up is Whatsapp images folder, not my phone albums, which is annoying. Why break something that was working?? I contacted support about this and the only thing it replied was that Im probably using an unofficial whatsapp app, which is ridiculous. I'd give 0 stars if it'd be possible."
"Can you add the features to swipe slide bar in chat. Because when I want to search some text in particular chat,i want to swipe the screen to hard to get that. Enabling swipe slide bar on the right of the particular chat, help us to read the chats whenever we have to."
"Dear whataap team kindly request to you whenever we do video call on whatsapp, Video call as well as when we are doing other work in the phone and when we minimize the video screen, the screen of the outgoing video released from here comes down. Earlier it was not that his screen was always set wherever we wanted. If we talk in a full video call like in a video call, then I can put my own video of any other video call there, But since this is your last update problem happen"
"Trying to send a random video and see a message: failed to process video, please try again later. If you keep seeing this message please restart your device. BUT! Even if I restart my device I can't send any damn videos!!! Since yesterday I have restarted many times! It doesn't work! Why you advise the action which does not even work?!"
"This app has become a joke. Message count in the status bar on samsung is non-existent, more over for each chat like it used to be, I get randomly sent back to messages I have already read, it never properly syncs with my pc, has a ton of lag... how can an app work wose than it used to 1 year ago... how am I supposed to bring up the lack of customization when the core features are broken... this is genuinely sad... please at least fix the number of messages in the status bar, that was important!"
"Account stolen 2 weeks ago. Someone is messaging and harassing my friends from my name. I have contacted Meta multiple times. All I get are variations of ""request a text and if you had many attempts - wait"". I do not receive texts I have waited for way too much time to get it resolved. There is zero help from Meta. At this point I have had enough and ready to switch. If your account is still ok - set up 2fa. I would not have this issue if I did."
Nice but then suddenly notifications stopped showing like what kind of whatsaap is that and again the way the voice in the calls keeps on cutting is very bad. I can't even hear calls anymore because of this notification problem. Please fix these as soon as possible
"You must include chat locker option for privacy asap because iss so annoying and irritating when someone else sees your message do you don't get the notification further and it can cause many problems, dear whatsapp I have a humble request pls ensure that there is a chat locker option within this app for privacy within the next update. Although this app is very good and gives excellent service.. THANK YOU"
"It is very good conversation way. But what's app groups and contact are separate, it is more visible to check the massages from groups. It is like GB what's app and yoyo what's. Many people like this apps only this future. So, you also improve it. It is more useful to students and employees...."
"After facebook bought this app for money this app doesnt work the way it used to. Uploading files taking forever, connecting to laptop takes longer. Even unable to download some files sometimes. I have send it to someone else to download it on PC. Fix your app. Iam typing this after an incident also. I am so frustrated. Iam pretty sure its not a issue with my connection or my device because all are up to date. Updated review still not fixed"
"You have to improve your security. You should not allow screen recording while video calling for user's privacy. Anyone can record video calls and misuse them for blackmailing or another purpose,mainly this is used against girls. So please update whatsApp and stop allowing screen record while video calling. Thank you❤🌹🙏."
Popup notifications have neen disabled on my s10 & cannot be enabled after upgrading to android 10. I've been using this for work daily with android auto. But the only notification I get while driving now is just a brief drop In audio with no notification of messages. Feels like a giant step back. I'll need to use another app.
"It often is crashing. In the last one month time, this app has crashed for the third time, and wont open. How many times do i need to uninstall and reinstall and backup so this app works fine. Urgh!"
When are you guys going to sort out the below problem? It's been a year already!!!! . . . New update yet no improvements to photo quality after posting a status. It's so sad that my friends and family does not get to see the pics I've taken on my S21 Ultra.
"During calls when I switch to Bluetooth device, it doesn't transfer my call to the connected device. I'm not sure what's the issue. I tried with different devices, the result is the same."
Since the last update the photo selector is completely useless as others have mentioned. I also couldn't restore my back up when I switched phones and ended up losing a LOT of conversation history.
"The bugs have been progressively increasing for the past one year. There is a weird bug while scrolling up the chats whereby it scrolls up to 2 or 3 days earlier instead of the recent chats. I suggest you prioritise squashing your bugs than providing new features, the app is getting less stable by the day. The community feature you introduced wasn't necessary in my opinion."
Since latest update it's lost ability to easily attach recent Camera photos other than searching via Google Files and attaching. In doing so it loses any Caption text which has to be rekeyed. Also can't now attach multiple images. (Motorola G22)
"Since the last few updates, clearly an issue with the app is the inability to end calls. Menu doesn't come up at all during a call regardless."
"Trash app, I am trying to enter verification code and it keep crashing whilst also keep sending the codes to the other mobile. Then now keep force exit after saying I need to wait 24hours just to send same exact code that I cannot enter at all. Fire yourself, dev, I don't need auto recognition from messages since my card not always on the mobile I use WA on, so dumb."
"I have never had an issue with Whatsapp, love the app. Recently not all my photos and images show up when I want to attach a file. Media visibility is ticked. Please advise?"
"THE best communication app available. Top-quality video and audio, AND it lets you write in italics. Italics, dude. Tell me another app that lets you do that. You can't. These people know what they're doing. BIG TIME. Ditch SMS! It's worthless! WhatsApp 4 life!"
Its an ok app everyone uses so have to. status can have only 30 secs videos so bad should increase to 1 min hate it i have to split insta videos to put on status &cannot share videos higher than 16mb. DP pic is just 1. Telegram let's you keep 9 Too many negatives.
Latest update was not satisfied in video call.Because video call once minimize totally minimized. I Couldn't continue to normal chat in video call at same time. This update was more irritating. Old update was good in video call with chat at same time. So rectify this problem in future
Can neither use emojis nor stickers anymore. The app keeps breaking down if I'm trying to use them. Calls don't work well anymore aswell and the gallery thing gets mentioned in every other review here too. It's been a cool app so far. But now it's just exhausting to use it.
"My WhatsApp has been so slow in receiving and sending messages. I have uninstalled and reinstalled but still same issue. And also, it's always showing WhatsApp isn't responding. Why these problems? It's so annoying"
"Im unable to connect to incoming audio calls. When I try to attend the incoming call , it shows connecting and doesn't proceed ahead. Some bug ...it shows older version of WhatsApp on some messages"
"I have an issue while using Whatsapp on Redmi note 10 pro (128GB/8GB). When ever I type a message, it doesn't get delivered. That is, the clock sign is there. No single or double check ✔️✔️. Whenever I exist the app then open again, the message will deliver. Every other thing is running smoothly, status are coming in, and no lag. But whenever I send a message it doesn't get delivered until I exist nd open the app again. If I type another message, it doesn't send. This is a bug"
"I'm not happy with the recent update. The media (photos, videos) that I receive, no longer appears in my gallery! I have to save the image while in whatsapp."
May I suggest a feature or update where users can write status or post two connecting write-up at one go if the word limit exceeds in one post just for the simple reason that the readers can go through it in one go without taking a time gap. If you know what I mean.
The latest update does not allow you to play music in the background during a video call. WhatsApp use to allow this. I loved it! I would call someone and talk to them while I listened to soft music or if I felt like having company but I needed to study then we would have a muted call while I listened to music. I am very disappointed that this feature is not in the new update. Can this feature be added for those who like to the same thing as me. I am sure I am not the only one. Thank you.
Changed the layout on android. It sucks! Cannot select photos easily like I used to. Also cannot send multiple photos at the same time. What was wrong with the old layout?
The new feature to see status by clicking just on profile picture is so frustrating. If we want to see status then we can go to status tab but since we want to see profile picture we click on it but it forwards us to status making it bit of useless. So I would suggest you to remove it from main screen or it may ask us on main screen whether to see profile picture or status. Thank you ..
"Having problem with restoring my data that i kepted since more than 8 years (chats, media...). To find out later that everything is vanished and no one helps you even the whatsapp support group of help it's an automatic response. Really disappointed for my main messaging application. 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎"
"Sometimes, massage is already sent but any tick didn't appears , same is with media and if someone sends me any photo or video and i download it but even after downloading it, it will appear in gallery but unable to see it chat bot. Facing these glitches since a long time, please fix it!"
"WhatsApp has always been a great app, however as with other people since the last update I can no longer see my camera/gallery photos in the share tab. It'll only show me photos that are already in WhatsApp galleries/other conversations...which is useless really. I too have a Samsung S21 as other people have started. Hope this gets sorted soon."
"Need improvement in status reaction.  It is to send a message to the person, but it's not good. Can you update like, insta, just click emotions and we will check who is all given emotions through the status viewer list."
"Not sure what happened but it has a tendency to freeze and it's very annoying if I have important messages, the app would crash and it seems like it's only on very few phones that this happens, please fix this as soon as possible."
"It's a good app but I wish to see an update that let's you re-download old deleted voice notes and images instead of saying ""this media file appears to be missing. Ask the person to resend it"". Really looking forward to see this update soon. Will edit my rating and comment once this feature is introduced."
Notifications stopped working after the last update. I've tried to clear data and re-install but it didn't help. Support was completely useless.
"I launched whatsapp on my computer for work. But I wasn't able to use it because apparently I'm not allowed to without the ""performance improvements and features"" and have to click update because in 2022 it doesn't do it itself. I click and... it opens the windows store, which in turn only launches whatsapp again. I go to the website and it simply has no download button on the download page. It's one of the stupidest things I've ever seen. I wish meta it's deserved bankruptcy."
"This app used to be my go to for communication between me (USA) and my family (Germany).i have used this app for over 10 years and will no longer use it. Getting interrupted every 30 seconds takes the point out of a voice conversation. Thanks facebook for ruining this app, as well. So aggravated with this and once i find a suitable replacement i will uninstall this and never look back. Good riddance"
"Why ""deleting message"" always showing in the notification? It's already been week, how come still loading to delete messages. It keeps my battery draining fast and make my phone hot. I already update, uninstall and re-install, still can't be fixed"
"The best chatting app I can choose either want to download pictures or video or not.The new update, messages reaction is good for me because I don't want to end up bluetick my friends.The status feature is very good since I downloaded this app. But please don't low the video's quality on status"
"The latest update has RUINED my whatsapp experience!!! There is no direct access to the main gallery, and it is very upsetting. It just takes more time for me to find stuff, and making things slower equals a huge step BACKWARDS! Unsatisfied...Change it back.."
I was using this application for many years but this problem arrived this time only. If I contact a person from my chats and delete the chats too then the chats shows up in the whatsapp. Whatsapp chats are not arranged timely. Older chats are shown up and newer in down. This is really very problematic. Is this problem being faced by me only or anyone among you is facing the same after recent update?? Please let me know if it is a setting changed or anything too. Help please if anyone can
"It's an amazing app!! There's just a few things I would like to request. We need more emojis!! For example a Spider-Man emoji. Ohh and also all sorts of guns! There's only a water gun. Now, with the wallpapers that WhatsApp provide: I would like if you could maybe add some more wallpapers with holiday themes, for example Christmas, Valentine's day etc. I still give this a 5 star, since it's such an amazing app!!"
I am disappointed this time by this app first it used to show time when the messages are sent . It used to show last seen it used to show yesterday and date if we need to find something important but now i don't feel like this app is same as before u should do change in the things which require changes in them not on the things which are way more good already. I hope u will change this mistake of yours.
"Love this app , it's convenient for people who are far from their families to communicate . Everything works pretty well . We see all updates added and we appreciate them all , although now we need a ""WhatsApp live"" feature . Also we need more languages . Keep up with the good job !"
"Why does swiping right on a photo go to the previous photo? It should go to the next photo. Also needs more features such as 60fps video upload support and ""read counters"" to show who has read your message in a group. Deleting messages shouldn't leave a trace otherwise people know you've deleted a message"
"Whatsapp banned 3 of my accounts without any reason. I lost all my important groups especially since I was the admin. Some of us share job posts via the app, we use the app for important things other than just texting friends and family and if the new updated policy will flag your account without warning and flag some activities as ""spam"" this makes me wonder if the app is really end to end encryption. I lost information that took years to get SHM!"
"peace be upon you all. I have just now lost all my information stored in last 3/4 years of my use. this is absolutely disappointing please let me know how do I restore. if you are a good service provider for the interest of the users, you will surely have ways to restore my audios,pictures and messages.but if there's no way to do,why you did not inform me since you know who is your old user who is new user? very naturally all user will want to have their information stored safe. help."
"I was forced to update the app to latest version. That's bad. Frequent crashes when using it with wireless earbuds during the call. The main problem is for sure we can't listen to de Voice notes in private way, I don't wanna listen to my audios through the speaker! Added to this, keeps the screen on causing accidently touches. Summary: used to be really good, currently is very poor."
"Why is it suddenly a pain to attach photos? Most images aren't available within the app, forcing you to go the long way of finding the pic in your gallery and sharing back into the chat you were already in. Worked fine before?"
"From bad to worst after the update. All files that wanting to share and send have to go to the most troublesome ways by going to files and select it 1 by 1. The camera taking through whatsapp is still blurry compare to taking pictures using camera app, and also the delay even at the best network area. Also this problem has always occurs everytime when there's a big update."
"Recent update really annoying. It's now so counterintuitive to send a photo. It's defaults to photos you've already been sent in WhatsApp, and you have to jump through hoops to get to your phone gallery."
"nice update but it bothers me when I updated, I can't ss the one view pictures, of course but I'm confused to how come my friends updated WhatsApp and still can ss one view pics? Some of the people I know hasn't updated yet because they still wanna ss one view pics. My suggestion is to pop up a force update notice on the screen when they enter the app, it will not let you continue until you updated it. I know my suggestion is a bit harsh but please do understand its for the sake of privacy.."
"Terrible update. You can only select photos that have been sent through WhatsApp to send and have to press thee 3 dots to select your gallery, which then you can only select one photo at a time and you can't send videos! Why on earth would they even change this!?!?"
"Should improve on flexibility to those having 2 or more devices with same account. Can't be keep swapping phones, sync and updates on different devices if only decide to bring one device out."
"I have enjoyed the App and am ok with what it has been given, it nice knoww that I could chart and call at the same time and still enjoy the internet service but you need to improve on the calls network and the picture quality and most of all the data should be less for people to be able to continue to work and enjoy your services. Thanks"
I am using OnePlus 10 pro.. Recently i am getting problems while connecting calls on data.....and it is working in wifi.....i have done all process through operator also changed sim card.....and also connected whatsapp support.....but not getting any help so far....
New multi click photo sharing is a major irritation. I sent an email to the WhatsApp team when it happened and got a generic response... don't the people who make these changes use their own app? How can they think this is an improvement? I've been waiting patiently for them to fix it... I'm not holding my breath.
"What happened to my photos? Everytime I want to send a photo while in the app it shows ""recent"". But they are ONLY whatsapp photo I've received or sent in the past. When I open the photo button I want to share directly from my galery again and not go through 5 steps to do that! Please reverse this update. It sucks."
Since the last update I don't get any notifications when messages come in except I open the app. This is really terrible. Wish I can give zero ratings. Pls fix this. Been making me miss important messages. Having issues these past few days. No sound when messages come in and doesn't pop up or notify. Have checked my settings for WhatsApp and its not restricted in anyway.
"I keep getting ban on my account for no reason. I accused for spam that I never done, got that 3 times within 2 days! Even the appeal need couple of hours, so I can't used this app for that long. Even more, the support service doesn't willing to help me. So annoying and frustrating"
WhatsApp first of all I am thankful for you've added the poll feature which is super essential nowadays.Now secondy requesting you to add two more things.Adding a survey option in which questions might be asked and people might give the own replies instead of selecting pre-written replies in Poll. 2nd. Add a highlight message option in which the message might be highlited by admins/owner. This is not to be confused with Starred messages
"What'sapp has been the best app ever. Everything does so cool and sweet, I don't really know why people are complaining about this app, maybe the problem is from the network or their phones. As for me what's app has been the best app, better than, telegram other similar ones.... So u people should keep your good works up and put more efforts for the more best features.... Thank u"
"Transferred app to new phone, still works perfectly on the old phone, keeps crashing on this one. I uninstalled & installed again a couple times, a pop up appears saying a bug is in the app & it's using too much battery power, recommended to deep sleep, I need this app on new phone. Fix please."
"My experience in using the app is nice but I would appreciate it if you add my suggestion in your settings. I suggest you add a setting where by you can set your WhatsApp in such a way that only those people in your contact list can chat you up not some stranger you don't know, and not for one to wait until the stranger chats him/her up before blocking, but if there is such in existence already please I would love to be directed on where to see the setting in the app, thank you."
"Dear whatsapp I have a small problem, the other day my friend sent a one view to my other friend and i was there and realized that the new update doesn't allow screenshots right? But my friend uses a IOS device and screen records and it still counts as capturing the one view still and find it unfair..if you understand what I mean thank you can that be fixed?"
"It's fine as a messaging app. Audio quality is fine, video call quality is pretty garbage at best. Video looks compressed and looks like it came from the 90s"
I am rating 1 star just for new updates for status otherwise whatsapp is a good app. Font size in status is too small and there are alot of difficulties in typing specialy in urdu the position of word changes automatically.Did not understand where to put the cursor. kindly improve this feature
"Fix the issue!! If you try to connect to Bluetooth after a call has started it shows the symbol on screen but dose not connect and will have to End the call. Very inconvenient it you are switching from headset to car audio many times a day specially on business calls, not professional at all having to say I'll call you back to s client."
Whatsapp is a very useful app but the new update version lead to some awful and unwanted experience b/c if I delete some messages from a chat that specific chat/contact no still remains at the top of the inbox please someone fix that unwanted feature..
"My app crushed twice in a month with an error message. All my conversations disappeared and finally l wasn't able to restore the latest backup, but the previous one."
"Latest update is not providing option to upload photos from gallery when the camera icon is clicked. It is only displaying whatsapp photos. It is inconvenient to go to the three dots, choose gallery and choose photos from albums!"
New update is awful. Hate the fact you cannot send more than 1 image and the gallery is a pain to get to. I don't like the new layout at all. It's horrible and not nice to navigate through
I can no longer send multiple photos of my child to my grandparents. I can't send them videos of her as she grows. What is even the point of a communication app THAT DOESNT DO THIS BASIC STUFF?! They are not tech savvy enough to learn a while new app. Fix this ffs
New update sucks!! I can no longer see any of my new photos in Whatsapp when trying to send them. I have to exit out of the app to my phones gallery and send it from there via the Whatsapp link. Who thought this was a brilliant idea? I will no longer use this app if this becomes the norm.
"I don't know if its because of Android 13 or the new update of WhatsApp, but now the app is BROKEN. If you take a pic or a video it's gonna take the app hours to realize that you did and before so you won't be able to send it anymore from the app. You must get to the gallery and share it from there. For example about 12 hours ago I took a pic and UNTIL NOW it's not shown im my recent pictures and i'm not able to send it easily. Let alone the videos which are a whole different kind of ball game.."
"A very good app to use and it could have been 5 stars, but the problem now with the new update Is that when you want to view someone's profile picture and that person has uploaded status it will automatically go to open the status even though if you do not want to view the status, that is actually wrong. Please do something about it."
"Pleaaseee for the love of god stop reducing the quality of pictures or videos when we upload them either on our story or display picture! Please consider adding a replay of a story instead of automatically going to the next contact's story, also try adding an option to select the duration of a story instead of just 30 seconds 🥺 its frustrating of only being able to upload a 30sec video!"
"Whatsapp interfering with other apps on android. While on video call on whatsapp you can not listen to other videos on websites. To be able to watch the video, the video's audio cannot be active. This started happening on last update. Once you end the call all videos work fine. Please fix"
"This is helpful to contact people you want to contact yourself but is also unhelpful in the sense that it won't even let you send a message to someone without requiring access to your phone contacts. If I want to add them from my phone, I will, I don't need WhatsApp making it so that the option is forced out of my control."
"User friendly. Simple but effective. I really like this app, one of the best ways to keep in touch with friends and family. I noticed you introduced a poll option in groups. Can you also add that poll feature to the WhatsApp status? And also, i think going LIVE on WhatsApp would interest people more."
"Whatsapp itself is fine as it very easy to communicate, however, in terms of customer service, its very different to ask help. I have provided the details, and kept on repeating the troubleshoot I should do, which sounds like they are not reading the exact content of my email. Very frustrated already"
I actually really like the app hey. I'm able to chat and video or voice call with my family and friends The only problem is that it limits the seconds your status should be(30secs) and how many videos and pictures you are allowed to send to anyone(30 videos/pictures) but overall.....I really really really like the app😁
"New community feature is terrible. It's not useful for 99.99% of users. I thought it's up to me alone to control it. But when I used it, it merged ALL contacts in the 2 groups that I added to the Community!!! Without prior notice and it notified everybody in those groups! As a result, some people left, because you can't use their numbers to merge in same community WITHOUT ASKING THEM! I was ashamed of what the What's App did."
"After the recent updates, the app runs slower and heavier. The photos downloaded are blurred before i opened it. I have to tap to open the photos so i can see it without blurred. And somehow people's stories with photos are also blurred i cannot see the photos please fix it ASAP. It's inconvenient"
"Edit: have tried using wifi, cellular, app with cleared cache and two seperare Google drive accounts. Backup constantly gets stuck. Of you do a Google search on the topic HUNDREDS of articles are written on it. Meaning it's been an issue, and for so long that hundreds of people wrote about how they fixed it. Shows that Whatsapp cares zero about the issue, or it'd be explained or solved by now."
"For those having trouble sending videos because its taking forever to upload, doest upload at all, or plays fast and doesnt sync audio: lower the resolution that your camera takes video on. For some reason it cant handle anything longer than 1 minute on high resolution. Solution: lower the Resolution Example; From: 2320x1080 To: 1920x1080 Started happening after the latest forced update 🤷🤷"
It's a good app. But i think it must need some new salient features such as a Like❤ option on a status like an Instagram which may be helpful for the people who don't use Instagram. Through this they can show their feelings towards that people whom they like the most. Through this option the people who don't talk to each other due to shyness but they like each other can share their feelings. So i think the whatsapp should add this feature for making it more worthy.👍👍
"There is no way to turn off receiving calls. Whenever a group you are in decides to make a call, there is automatically a full screen popup to tell you and there is no way to disable this. It has interrupted many important moments and has made me consider uninstalling. The only thing that has kept me installed are family groups."
"Good app. Works well for me. 12/01/22 update: since the last 2 updates I now have issues with notifications. Sometimes I get notified of new messages, sometimes I don't! Very frustrating! 🤨. I have to constantly go to the app to see if I've gotten any new messages."
"New update features are good! But earlier when I sent videos in my group, the video thumbnails were also visible to group members. This feature is no longer and now only the video links can be sent and not their thumbnails. If u guys can add this feature back, it would be nice!"
"I am not being able to use the camera, or send any picture to someone while in video call. Previously, my camera would just turn off while the call would continue. Now , every time I open gallery in WhatsApp the call gets cut. It is really annoying, please fix this."
"Yea its good and all but one thing that frustrated me is the quality of media that i posted on status. Why cant i post it in high quality? Developer should add the option for the quality of media that users uploaded. I took a nice pic on my cam, in hopes to share the result only for the quality to be reduced. The app really doesn't feel as smooth as telegram maybe optimization should be added"
When we do videocall....for first 30-40 seconds it is going smoothly....after that video stuck suddenly and didn't resume again...then I have to remove this from recent open application it shows...whatsapp is not working properly...either wait or cancel....when we cancelled the call....call was cut but time is continuously shown on the top of notifications.....I have faced this issue from last 10-12 days. Plz concern this issue...I have explained every single detail.
"Previously when I used to delete a message from a chat, whatsapp automatically use to resort the chat list according to date. but now when I delete a message, it does not change the chat list by date. For example, if someone messaged me last month and then again today, if I delete todays message, his chat will not move down to last month. In fact, it will remain on top of the list with last month date on the right. Does anyone know how to fix this issue?"
"Great app. What I found annoying is that I can not edit the messsage after hitting the send button. I do not like auto correction becuase is not that smart yet. So this app force me to delete and send a new message. Most likely with new typos. Please implement: updateSentMessage(msgId, newMsg) Thanks."
"As mentioned previously, the latest issue now prevents the user from directly attaching photos taken with the camera. The only way to do it is to go to Google photos then share to WhatsApp and select the chat, whereas previously you were able to access the photos you have taken directly whilst in the chat. Needs fixed!"
"There's some issues for me if i compare with the precious version when in the previous one we still can take a screemshot or screen recording while we see a view once message from somebody but in this version we're unable to take with it, which is this feature decrease of usable storage just for sending or receiving some images or videos if it's not very important while in the otherwise there are some of messages that very important that we want to know secretly and wihout using so much space."
The latest update has RUINED the text status feature. Before the update the text would change size gradually from big to small depending on how much text was used. Now the text just drops to a very small font even with just 10 words. What's the point of text statuses if we have to squint to see them?
I recently updated to Samsung A 13. I am having issues with very slow up and downloads. Used To be super quick. Not sure if it's my carrier or what. Also people not in my contact list show up and I have to delete them. This app very useful hope I can get it to work correctly.
"WhatsaApp is a great product. However, lately I have been experiencing this issue in which anytime I listen to a voice note, I can't change the speed from 1.5x. Also my chat box is locked ie. I can't type while listening to a vn. Please help resolve."
"The data restoration on this is absolutely awful, the app recognises that I have a back up in my drive, SO WHY ISN'T THERE AN OPTION TO LOAD IT RATHER THAN JUMPING THROUGH FLAMMING HOOPS TO GET NOWHERE!?! . . Edit: I finally did it after copying the files from my old phone, and reinstalling the app by uninstalling and reinstalling via the app store rather than uninstalling from the home screen"
"Hi whatsapp team, This is to inform you that I know very well you have added send document option but even then, You have to add an option If we send an image from the gallery then the options will appear whether you want to send the image original or compromise the image quality., And second thing if i select 2 or more image or audio video then option will be shown only whatsapp sharing option , but other app sharing option is not showing, why, so please add this option... It is very useful."
"Slow and horrible. Message received notification non existing. You have to open the app to see it. Trying to call it is a nightmare. ""Calling"" message on the screen than ""ringing"" but in the end line cut. You make it very confusing with this calling than ringing notifications without any tone. Just horrible annoying experience"
"It is the best application to work with, we can chat , talk to anyone .You can add status so that everyone can have a look for the picture for a special events. I 'd love to say that this is the best application to talk,chat with anyone . You can even send sticker , emojis , gif . You can make video calls and send images , files ,ppt , exel etc.. I think it's the best .........."
"1970 timestamp Bug on downloaded media, media appear to be download in phone storage, but not media on app not appearing (showing download icon on top of media). Pressing on the download button simultaneous will just add more duplicate downloads in the photo storage. Didn't have this bug prior to the this current update. Please help to fix this bug. Thanks developer. 🙏"
"Recently message don't come in until I open the App. Notification is on, yet there would be missed calls and msgs but I have to keep Checking to see if I have received any. I have been using Pop-up action for ever.. unfortunately doesn't seem to be working anymore. I probably have to get rid of the App because it's Ridiculous to be going through that Process to get ones msgs etc 😡"
I do have a suggestion ...why don't we include music options in whatsapp. And when we upload a status it's better if there is a option for mute the original sound ..and by music option we can add songs we wanted ...why don't we consider this option...it will be more attractive and useful I think..many peoples must be thinking about this
"Chats are flickering in chat page (display picture and chat) when something is happening in the conversation such as change from one tick to two ticks or to blue ticks, or if recipient is recording a voice note or typing. This will only occure when in chat page not within the conversation. Edit: issue solved with the last update, thank you"
"Screenshot folder disappeared. Since the last update, I cannot send people my screenshots as the app cannot access my Oneplus 8's (Android 13, Oxygen Os) screenshot folder. This is really frustrating as I have to go to my Phones gallery app each time to search for the screenshot and Send the file to the Whatsapp user. I have to do the same thing if I want to publish a Status on Whatsapp. I send several Screenshots on a daily basis as it also consists of my work proof and projects. Pls fix 🤙🏽😘"
"I want to suggest one ENHANCEMENT here. By mistake I sent an image in a different group. I didn't want to send message in that group, so I clicked on Delete option which has 3 suboptions. I wanted to select DELETE FOR EVERYONE but I was in hurry and I selected DELETE FOR ME. Now every one could see that image except the one who sent ( that's me). There should be a feature to RETRIEVE THE DELETED MESSAGE."
"I am facing quite a lot of bugs in the new update. I keep typing and sending the but it just doest not send until I close and reopen the app. There is an option of reply to a message in chats, in past after sending the message the app would take you to the most recent message, now I have to scroll back down"
"WhatsApp Web Update Makes my laptop laggy and constantly freeze while downloading messages. It's really annoying that it needs to charge every time I wanna use it, even when my phone is next to it. Takes forever to be ready to use, worthless. Return the ""Recent"" album to quick access when sending pictures."
a person is allowed to Share only to five people ?? YOU GUYS KNOW THIS IS A MESSAGING APP NOT COOL 👎👎. when trying to change/make names of contacts in the app sometimes it makes doubles of the same contacts and if I try to delete the doubles of the contacts it deletes the original contact completely ??. the app doesn't always work the notifications don't always work example: my dad's phone he needs to open the app to get the notifications. fix the bugs.
"My whatsapp can't connect to the internet. I realized this happening when i tried to send text just now and it wouldn't go through. Same thing is happening to my mom's whatsapp. Unfortunately, before i check in with my mom, i thought it was just a technical problem. After rebooting my phone didn't work, i tried uninstalling whatsapp hoping it would go back to normal when i reinstall it, but now i couldn't restore my messages and I'm panicking. Please do something I can't lose my messages."
Never had an issue with the app. Only had issues with the people on it. I'm getting really uncomfortable about people finding me that I don't know an never gave out my number. Getting really creepy. I had to turn off all my calling features or block calls from calling all thru out the night when I'm trying to sleep.
Has something just changed? Up until a few days ago if I had multiple voice messages they would play automatically one after another for however long they went for. But now they stop as soon as my screen times out so I have to keep tapping on the screen to keep them playing. It's so annoying! How do I make them keep playing even after screen timesout and locks?
"What the hell happened from the last update? I would usually tap on the attached button to select photos and videos to send, now it's not even picking up videos and not been able to select multiple files to send like it did before. Terrible update which needs reverting back"
"Please stop giving us sticker suggestions when we type a word and want to insert an emoji. If I wanted to send a ""hello"" sticker, I would go directly to sticker panel for that. But if I want to type ""Hello ❤️"", I want to be able to type that without having to go to the sticker panel and the switch to the emoji panel. Please.One last thing, the app constantly disconnects from the internet. Whereas other apps are working fine, it'll disconnect itself & I therefor cannot receive any texts or calls."
Overall the app is good and excellent. But now there is a time to insert some new and advance features like to have some password or pattern or fingerprint on some person chat or group setting will have also to be updated to have the lock 🔒 features. please make it sure for the case of privacy of every person. This will makes it more efficient and advanced for the users to use it as compare to GB and other whatsapps.
"Annoying! Since the last update it is now not possible to easily and straightforwardly access the phone gallery, also doesnt show albums in a logical format ie most recent images and videos first. Also when the gallery is finally opened it is now not possible to add multiple images?! Sort it out!"
"I have constantly problems while talking via whatsapp. While I'm in a call it ends suddenly, then when I call the person back it only displays ""connecting"". And every time I have to turn off and on my wifi or mobile data in order to call someone again. 17.11.22 update Watsapp keeps gettin worse and worse.. I haven't had a voice call that doesn't crash.. it's just frustrating.."
"After the new android 13 update, any call gets disconnected after a few minutes saying ""call ended because there's a problem with your device's microphone. Try restarting your device and try again."" I have checked the microphone, and tried restarting it and other calls are also working fine, everything is fine still issue is keep occurring so bad QA has been done with the new android version."
The app reduces the quality of the shared contents especially the pictures. Kindly do add options for us to add music to our status and also increase the status duration for videos to atleast a minute. And also adda tagging option on the status. And also add filters to the camera as well as add an option of status only being shared with close friends
"The latest update is horrible! I can no longer send pictures easily with my Samsung phone. I have to make multiple steps to choose a screenshot or a camera picture to send. Moreover, I can no longer choose more than one picture to send at a time! Please fix it."
"Since last week i am facing problem, whatsapp started crashing at random times and all chats disappeared. Then it gives option to restore which stucks at different percentages, and it also stucks and shows error when try to restore from backup. While before this issue my all data continue to backup on google drive daily basis. Kindly look into this issue as soon as possible."
"Installed today, can't even get a profile picture to upload. Gets to the ""initializing"" screen, then errors out on a 675Mb connection. Tried to sign in on the web, but it requires the app to work (and the website was spinning where the QR code should have been). The status checker says the service is working normally. How do people rely on something this bad? If this is normal, I don't want to see what a problem looks like."
"The recent changes in the app have been commendable. Just one more request, please add a feature where I can hide a group for a definite/ indefinite period. There are some groups you are a part of, but you really don't want to be a part of, and can't exit for whatever reasons."
Overall this app is great in every aspect I like it very much but previously some updated features are not good such as story update on overall contact in chat with green circle is the wrost way . If we want to ignore someones story but the circle remains there and second one when you open dp the status showa up. This is not acceptable at all.
"I have been using this app more reliably then text for the last few years, superior. However the recent update now only shows me photos that are inside what'sapp, and not my gallery or camera without a few extra steps every time. Can anyone help undo this!! frustrating it can't see media on my phone"
"Storage issue: Whatsapp is 80 MB. Let's say you are about to send someone a file and you also have a movie in your phone of size 2 GB. If you mistakenly click on that movie, even after canceling, whatsapp will save it somewhere and you won't be able to delete it. Now your app size is 2GB 80MB + other data. My current Whatsapp app size is 5 GB, while I only have files 1.8 GB of files. Privacy issue: End to End encryption is turned off by default. I'm only using this because everyone else is."
"Forced me to setup the backup settings with no skip options! NEVER block and force users to do anything, it is incredibly frustrating and against any interface basics. I had an urgent message to send and I was forced to spend 5 infuriating minutes to configure my Google account! It was definitely not the moment..."
I use this app more than any other messaging service on my phone... the new update has completely ruined this app for me! You can no longer send multiple pictures at once and finding your gallery was almost impossible at first! Put it back to the way it was before!
"I cant stand this picture attachment nonsense why would you get rid of seeing everything from your gallery, everytime I want to send a screenshot now I have to go from my gallery and click share to WhatsApp then the conversation such nonsense so long winded and for what reason, also not being able to press down on an email address and click copy only having the option to open email apps is very very annoying. Fix this please!!!"
Please remove the feature of veiwing status from profile picture by the side of the chat so that the mantra of connecting people of the app stays intact because I feel people will eventually start getting used to see status there itself then the status section of the app. Disappearing message is a really good feature🤩 include group chat also for Disappearing messages. Give edit option for caption in status after adding it to the status if any spelling errors would be useful.
"After an update, the whatsapp web really delayed. I can't view my previous message, document, links like before. And in my phone, it really not friendly user anymore. When i want to upload my picture , i can't attach it many in the same time. And i need to click it one by one. Please fix this. I prefer the older version of this whatsapp app."
"In latest update in Whatsapp as ""Introducing communities"" is might be good for family / organization and group of friends. I'll suggest that there should be another update like the upper mention option that separate the groups from the contact chats totally.... It looks like a bulk of data / messages / audio video clips / sticker / emoji's etc etc... that's awful 😞 everytime.... This new update will be helpful and attracts the previous and new user's as well... Thanks a lot for your attention."
While scrolling there seems to be a new bug which directly makes us skip a few of the messages and secondly there seems to be an error with the message delivery system where I have to reload the app to know that the message is either sent or seen by the other person ( the tick and clock remains static while in the chat without changing until I come out of the chat)
"Using this app is a terrific method to remain in touch with friends and family that live abroad. I am unable to send or share video media, though, as of late. Receiving this error notice repeatedly is becoming unpleasant and frustrating. Look into it, please."
"Normally, all is fine (edit) but this time around after my app and phone update, all the permissions were revoked for some reason. I could not see my gallery to send photos and files, until I realised it is due to the permissions (which were on). So no idea why was that changed."
"My server is working fine but the messages that I'm trying to send somebody shows that clock sign for hours. After I cleared the data and tried to login, It says try again after 5 minutes. I'm so pissed off after trying it again and again. I've some really important messages to send somebody for which I only rely on this app. Do something."
"Hi I really like this app, I do use it in a regular basis every day. But some times it does slow down and let me down. I used to use other similar apps but they are not as flix able as watsapp, that's why watsapp becomes a primary app to me. Also almost all my friends and family use watsapp so it makes it more comfortable to use. Despite all of its good points it has its own downfall as well such as when you delete a message it remain on the page and indicates that a message has been deleted."
"Chatting Interface is good enough that's why it's a highly used app but sometimes whenever I try to see a status in low network coverage zone, I can't and even after I come to a good network coverage zone, I am still unable to see it. It just keeps on loading forever. Hope that WhatsApp looks into it"
"Rubbish after update, cannot attach photos taken after a certain date, the attachment search only sees part of what is saved to your phone. To send them, you have to find the picture in gallery and send from there, one at a time. Annoying, please fix."
"This app deserves 4.5 stars, but there is no option. Sometimes we are not able to play the voice, I just click on the option but it doesn't work and second, you all should allow group calls on PC (Laptop and Computer) version. That's all."
"Why did you ruin the photo sharing ability? I actually have to go to my phone's gallery to select multiple pictures in my camera's folder. If I try to share through WhatsApp, it only shows contact folders and I need to click 5 times to find the camera folder. It worked perfectly for ages until the recent update ruined my favourite message app."
"Great how this app used to be great, but every update destroys it more When backups came out I always had it on, but when it became always on I did all I could to turn it off, the auto backups didnt delete the last save, meaning I had 5 500mb files, plus they removed the option to choose the time for back up, and I am still using the app at 3am Now, today I get in the app, and ALL my messages are gone, my last one saved is from March, and I have to reinstall the app to even get my backup to work"
"overall good...please provide the below things 1. provide an option to undo while typing.. 2. profile pic can't be uploaded full, it crops which is a very big problem.. 3. please provide option that message could be listened and allow to edit status after posting. 4. Option to schedule message 5. Categorise msg like individual and groups in another space"
"Same issue as other reviewers, latest version on Android 13 makes it impossible to send multiple photos within app, as it only shows limited images. Work around is the three dots to view all photos, but can only send one at a time and no video. Please fix."
"It had been the best app before, but lately becoming bad one, for not popup notification on some types of android, making ones to lose urgent and very important messages that requires immediate reply.. very bad, the settings need to be urgently restore, bcoz I expect WhatsApp to maintain one among tops that it is before, not other way round."
"My comment from yesterday 11/29/22 is not here.  🤔 Here is a new one: 1. Can't restore my data (account looks new) after installing it to an android phone. Previous was iPhone & old model - NO access to WhatsApp! 2. Asked for help from WhatsApp 3. Got a most ""relevant"" answer :  ""To turn media visibility on or off for all chats: * Open WhatsApp > ... The media visibility feature only affects new media that comes in once the feature has been turned on or off and doesn’t apply to old media.""🙄"
"The latest version is a total mess!when i'm try to sending photo,it's only show the recent send photo in whatsapp instead of phone gallery album and i couldn't send video too!the latest version only allows me send photo once at a time.this is really unfriendly for the user!please bring back the previous version to us!!!!!"
"Whatsapp used to be the best before Facebook bought them. Now they truncate videos and pictures down to terrible quality! And now since a Samsung update you can no longer attach pics or videos from your gallery direct from the message (same as last review), you have to do it a much slower way. Not sure if it's a Samsung or whatsapp glitch. I am messaging with a rep but feel it's a robotic rep. Added: I figured out the issue! I had to open permissions and go to whatsapp and add photos and videos"""
"The app is fine but when you try to send a voice note, for some reason you can't really hear your recording properly. Sometimes you can but sometimes you can't. This is really excruciating and annoying! It's not like I covered my mic!"
"This version has a lot of bugs. Sometimes we just scrolling a particular chat but for a single scroll it landed on somewhere else of the chat. And also when we are opening the emoji section, it will open for just half of the normal range. Only after 2 to 3 taps the section will open normally. Too poor version."
"Latest version is not functioning as previously. Now you can't upload a picture taken with the phone camera app. You have to go through this cumbersome 2nd step to access the phone gallery app at the top right 3 dots...then can you only see phone camera app foto's to upload. This is not a great user experience. Further, uploading a photo taken with the phone camera app is also impossible. Keep receiving an error which says can't upload. Fix this please."
"In the previous versions, whenever my phone is in silent mode and I'm watching stories and statuses, the videos don't play audio and I really enjoyed it that way. Now there's no way of watching statuses without the audio playing. Please do something about this."
"Transfer from old mobile to new keeping phone number it's literally pain in the as. Unseccesfully trying to do this longer than one week already. Somehow TELEGRAM make it in easiest way. It tooks approx 15 seconds. Also functionality compare to TG on level of 2015. No big files, nothing. Who seriously using WA in 2022. FRUSTRATION, bad user expierience."
"WhatsApp reinstalled to restore previous chat. Backup previously left on, and backed up to the device, daily. I reinstalled, and two years of messages, timetables, details, numbers, and sentimental media were wiped. I contacted WhatsApp who gave advice based on having an old phone and restoring on a new device - not applicable. I received further advice to rename a backup file - unsuccessful. I was then told my query had been addressed. Everything lost, no troubleshoot. Further messages blanked."
"Worst! Right after I tried to give a missed voice call to my mother who's in abroad via whatsapp, the voice calling is not working and after reinstalling the app it says that unable to connect, make sure that your internet connection is working. What's going on in here with the WhatsApp. Can't manage anything properly."
"Respected Sir, Can you introduce the feature of read receipt option for separately for each contact because in case i want to ignore one contact, but i can't due to lack of this feature. It would be really good if you could do so...... I am sure many of your users will face this issue. Thank you."
"the new update is the worst thing ever - you can't even send one time viewing pictures (which you cannot make Screenshots off no more either which is completely dumb) from your laptop no more let alone open them - and for me, someone who uses their laptop for everything this is just so silly. Also in group chats the profile picture is also showing up next to one's message which is just ugly and unnecessary cause the name of the person is there anyways?!"
I would have given it 5 stars usually but this morning it has completely stopped sending or receiving messages. I can't message WhatsApp to find a way to fix it because they only message through WhatsApp. I have tried all online troubleshooting. I am unable to uninstall as it also won't backup and I need recently sent / received messages.
"Gone wrong after november update. Initially selecting a photo was not working, had to change the permissions manually. Now sending videos does not work. I did everything... Even fully reset the app, still says it cannot send the video. Any video. Samsung S22 Ultra"
"I think there is something wrong with whatsapp team. From past few days I am not unable to use or login to this app. It automatically gets unregistered from my phone. Many times, I have requested whatsapp team via email since there is no other means to contact them to look into this. However, no action has been taken so far. They just keep sending the automated reply. This is just pathetic and bizzare. Big time disappointed ☹️"
"WhatsApp was great but since the way sending photos has changed it really annoyed me as I was sending 4 photos to someone and ended up sending 25 as there was no sign that photos were sent just took me back to the bit where choosing photos to send is and it didn't disappear, sort out the way photos are sent as I'm sure I'm not the only one who got extremely confused with the way choosing photos didn't disappear like it use to"
"I like this app very much. I can keep in touch with family and friends near and far. My only thing I wish for is, a way to delete people who I no longer correspond with and delete those unknown folks who ""slip in"" messages trying to engage me in conversation. Thanks for your time."
"Please note as I was unable to send messages hence Uninstalled whatsapp. After installing the app when I mention my password it's showing ""Unable to connect. Please check that you are connected to internet and try again. Please reboot your device if your connection problem continues."" With my network I am able to install other apps and send messages. Only whatsapp is not working. Please help. Shall appreciate your quick response."
The latest update has messed about with the phone's gallery. I don't want to see what I've received from other conversations - I want to see my photos so I can share them. If it's not sorted soon I will end up hardly using it and by default removing it.
Messages no longer get delivered unless that person in online and looking at you chat. No notifications nothing. There settings are set for all notifications. But get nothing unless they go look. Unless it's fixed this app is garbage. Very frustrating and wast of your time.
"Over the past two weeks using WhatsApp was fun. Previewing links from status was nice, but I want to ask if WhatsApp was made for iOS only cuz it seems we on the android are destined to forever be backward, why bring an update and then retrogress back into the former, I want to state that I hate the bing font on status updates, bring back the link preview Meanwhile duplicate the feature that enables users to click on profiles from chatlist to view status, android users also matter."
"Problem... photo galleries screwed up. Now cannot select multiple photos to send on one message. Can see other users having the same complaint, on different phone models, on various forums. Yet another ""upgrade"" that is poorly thought out/ tested screwing up previous functionality."
"Whatsapp in itself is a good app, but recently I'm being flooded with fraudulent and spam messages and its really annoying. It would be much better if whatsapp could add a feature where unknown contacts cannot message or call me on whatsapp unless they are in my contact list. Hope whatsapp team would consider adding this feature soon... it would be really helpful to protect us from fraudsters."
"There is fatal error when I do voice call in WA version 2.22.23.84 and android version 13.. Voice call error always disturbing and mostly ended by appearing messages ""call ended because there's a problem with your phone's microphone"". When I use another apps calling its normal, also when I use cellphone call its normal. I think its fatal error that whatsapp should be fixed. Very annoying!"
"In my phone popup notification got disabled and when my phone is in silent mode, no vibrate nothing. No notification showing, when I click the application then all the messages will come. I communicate with whats app developer they mentioned pop up notification is not available on Android 10 and above. I really don't know that how they doing this. It's really big pblm for me. I just need a solution for this. Other Android 10 and above it's working fine. But in my mobile not working."
"Those having issues with gallery not showing up when sharing photos or videos, go to your app settings and allow permission for photo and video media. I'm not sure why it was disabled after update. Hope this helps."
"I'm having same problem photos are blurry, got in touch with WhatsApp support and they said, restart phone, turn airplane mode on then off, also data roaming, update WhatsApp all of which haven't worked. Something is obviously wrong somewhere. Just restarted my phone all is well now, you should restart your phone every now and then it sorts your phone out, I do it every month or so."
"Hi, My Whatsapp lags during voice calls since the ONE UI 5 UPDATE (ANDROID 13) on my s22 ultra. Since then I am unable to have lag free calls. Its not a network issue cz I tried with wifi as well. Same result. The voice disappears from both sides for few seconds after every 20 to 30 seconds during the voice calls. It takes almost 10 seconds to disconnect the call cz whatsapp does not respond. I have alreadg given all the permissions to the app. Uninstalled and reinstalled but in vain."
Would be a 5 star but WhatsApp really needs to have a voice activated option for recording voice clips! Voice messages are the future of CB radio on your phone. The driving and Trucking world would be very appreciative to have a voice activated voice clip function. Or release a WhatsApp dedicated earphone which does it at the push of a button.
"After using WhatsApp for 10 years, I've felt the need to provide feedback today, today, whilst trying to share a camera photo/video I am unable to view camera photos or any other folder containing media (besides WhatsApp media) when clicking the paper clip icon. I know have to click on the 3 dots AND THEN Gallery AFTER clicking the paper clip icon. In addition, I can only attach/share 1 camera photo at a time. Fix your Android O/S WhatsApp pls. Update required asap!"
Since the last update nothing works properly. Cant send images and can only get on media between me and a specific contact. Constantly backing up for hours at a time and messages are constantly slow to send often showing as unsent even if they the other person has received the message
"All the functions are good except the video call one. By mistouch or accidental touch on video call button, it would start calling immediately. So for the next software update, developers should consider displaying a popup for confirmation to proceed video call or cancel on pressing the video call button. Please consider this!"
"Please I made a video of 3 minutes and 29 seconds and when I send it, it gets cut off to 2 minutes. I'm not allowed to send the entire video. When I tried to send it as a document it showed that it was over 200mb!!! The video is only 17mb. Please fix this bug. Thank you."
"Update:. App uninstalled. Would not connect. So far very poor. Recently changed phones, using the same SIM card. I can't get it to verify my phone number. It doesn't send the text with code, then I have to wait 13hrs to try again. Tried the call me option, nothing happens. There's no customer service contact option."
"Whatsapp is a great app for communication, however since I upgraded my Android version to 12 on my Oppo A74, I can no longer terminate my WhatsApp video calls. Initially, I was hoping that you new updates will take care of that, but to my amazement, I have downloaded and installed two of your updates all to no avail. What do I do to solve this problem? Thanks."
"Terrible update. First, when you delete the last msgs of a chat, the chat still remains at today's position in the list of chats. However, it should move down to the last msg date available in the chat. Second, the list of unread msgs in the notification bar freezesany times and doesn't let you switch to any other app."
"Please, one important feature to add before telegram and signal,when hearing a voice message, add the option to direct the sound only to main speaker, this is especially useful if proximity sensor is malfunctioning, and please create a lite version of WhatsApp for low end devices that's and improvement, there's no improvement for this app, it's disappointing actually just add options and features, other messengers are better"
"I have changed my phone and uploaded everything from the previous phone, to this one. Ever since I've done that, I have not been receiving WhatsApp messages. Can someone please help me? I have reinstalled WhatsApp and restarted the phone, but nothing. I am sending messages and not receiving any."
"After the recent Update i was linking my whatsapp account with pc while i was scanning the QR code on my Windows 11 computer the whatsapp app on my phone has suddenly crashed and when i reopened again it said ""can't backup"". Later all my data which was backed up regularly has lost. I used an android device running on Android 12. The Pc has Windows 11 Pro. Please resolve the issue."
Uninstalled and reinstalled whatsapp on my samsung galaxy z fold 4 but still cannot upload videos to be sent! The popped up message showed to restart my device but still did not work after attempting it for so many times! This has never happened to me before! Truly disappointing!!!
It is pretty good app.. Everything was good until archive option came at the top..I archive the chats that I don't want to see.. If I open the app and it is screaming out the presence of the chats that I don't want to see then what will be the use of adding it under archived chat? Can you guys please make the necessary changes to this archive option so that it can be moved into top/ bottom according to user needs?
"WhatsApp is a good messaging app but still lacks some basic features i feel every messaging app should have, like...separating group chats from normal chats...returning to messages that haven't been read yet and not taking me to the last message when I click on it later on...also make all the messages arrive at the same time and not one after the other it slows down my device...I'd like to see previous messages when i enter a group...more over it's still a great messaging app, fast and reliable."
"Whatsap call does not ring properly. Usually, there is no ringtone at all and just display missed call, other times the ringtone is my messages notification sound just repeated over and over. Now the media doesnt even show up when trying to insert pictures."
"My family and I, who are spread out all over the world have been using this app a long time & loved to keep in touch. This last month or so, my phone sends me notifications that an apps using up WAY too much battery & it always this app. it pops up even when I've not opened the app that day yet. I've started several ""help"" conversations in the app, & every time they answer something I didn't ask about. I explain again & am told it shouldn't use much battery & they close chat without any help :("
"Where is the warning when you people want to work on the app?, What is wrong with sending out a notice stipulating we can't use our WhatsApp because you decided to work on it. This is the first time you have done this, I tested everything including different networks to make sure it isn't my network!, Next time you wanna do this send out a notice"
"Recently I detected a bug. My friend A was using WhatsApp in a phone. He got a new phone so he gave the phone to another friend B. Now when B login using his SIM, A's local backed up messages were restored in B's account. And A could not access his GROUPs in his new phone but B have access to all the personal groups of A. I didn't get much into details as I was busy. I deleted all datas and back ups and relogin B. All datas were lost. This is a very serious beach. Hope WhatsApp correct this bug."
"Since the last update, going to attach a screenshot is a pain, it seems to want to go through all your WhatsApp received pictures instead of phone albums first. In the past, picture, screenshot folder, select. Now, picture, top right, choose gallery, in gallery change to albums, then find folder then select. Videos also dont show up so only option is to go to main gallery, select video, then press share a d choose Whatsapp. Who on earth signed that off! Grrrr"
"I can't see the status of anybody in my contacts.it was showing like ""There was an error in playing this video"". I was literally irratated after trying many attempts to see the status of all. WhatsApp .... You are pleased to solve the issue as many users are facing the same issue"
"I have an issue, about sending pictures / videos, it bothersome, it can't send directly from whatsapp apps, unless you took the picture/video by using in app camera, or you should access to gallery and tap share button, which is very ineffective, and took my precious time, this glitch/bug also affect even with screenshot, Somehow this wasn't happened before, my phone is Samsung Galaxy A53 5G, Please FIX THIS!"
"This version doesn't support the latest Android version as a result of which, the compatibility issues are there. If you want to download media, it needs a lot of permissions and practically everything tobbe accessed, which shouldn't be and was not there untill I updated my Phone today. WhatsApp team to please look into it and sort out the issues. I am using Samsung S22 Ultra Phone."
"When on a WhatsApp voice call, it doesn't switch seamlessly from LTE to WiFi or vice versa, when one or the other loses connection. You need to cut the call and switch to other connection and again place the call, which is very frustrating."
Too many issues lately. Tells me I have no internet connection when everything else works just fine. Struggled for 2days to get my backup restored on my new phone. It gets harder and harder to use the app. It was a good app in the past but now that Facebook owns it became useless.
"I cant send pictures or videos direct from whatsapp. I have to go back to my gallery. So annoying. The worst part is when making Call it will end with error that "" Call ended because there is a problem with your device's microphone. Try retartibg your device and try again"" ."
"The updated version is very cool especially the polls. But you should make it in such a way that someone can only choose one option. But here lies the case one whatsapp user can choose all the options available, it's very bad. Please do something about it. The poll should also have a deadline."
Usually A great app. Now with the change of having to go in deeper to attach pictures or videos is ridiculous. Please leave it the way it was. I'm not able to to select and view at the same time either.
"WhatsApp has a lot of bugs, especially when it comes to voice calls, sometimes you can't hear the voice. After that, when you're in a voice call, it suddenly end and there's also a broken radio sound.please fix it immediately."
"Hi, WhatsApp LLC. i rated this a 4 Star, because there was some bugs that was ALWAYS happening almost everyday! every time i'm chatting with my bestfriend, sometimes it randomly wouldn't let me send the message and its the clock logo. i don't know what happened, tried alot of tutorials but still didn't work. thanks."
V. Good. Needs notification sound option with word wattsapp morphed into it. S10plus.once I have granted all permissions I'm told to remove permissions to free up space. Needs method optional for reading messages. I would like option to record my calls. Sometimes difficult to select copy and paste messages.
Whatsapp has changed recently and now i can't send multuple photos from my phone unless they have been previously received via WhatsApp. I even need to go through a couple of extra steps to access my photos folder I don't know why they changed this feature and want to priorotise WhatsApp folders but it's gone from being the best messaging app to now worse that Facebook messenger. Who the hell are they paying to write the code for this app because if they keep this up they will kill it!!!
"The new features are great. However, I want to recommend that you introduce a link reset option for the call link. So that when a user creates a link for a group call, when it's done, the link can be reset and made unusable"
Quite disappointed that whatsapp does not let you choose SD card for default data storage. This should have been the developers top priority for an app that can fill the internal storage so rapidly. I know several people who have stopped using the app for this very reason.
Ever since I updated to android 13 I've been unable to send photos not taken in whatsapp. I used to have the option to browse my gallery within whatsapp but now I'm only seeing media sent or taken within the app. I have to go to Google photos and send it from there. Hoping this is a bug that can be fixed 🙏
"Previously had issues but looks like it has been resolved. The app appears to be more reliable than the network service providers, especially mobile calls. Really appreciative of the effort and service provided by the Developers."
"It's really good, but just one thing about the new updates. The feature that allows admins to delete anyone's message only works one message at a time. If you highlight more than one of someone else's message then it doesn't come up with the option to delete it for everyone else. Is that intentional?"
"WhatsApp Media doesn't show up on my gallery anymore for some reason and it's not a malfunction in the phone as far as I know. I can't even share the pics I get on WhatsApp till I transfer them to another folder, which is annoying. I liked WhatsApp in the past but due to this issue I'm starting to get annoyed using WhatsApp."
WhatsApp I meant tell you guys from a long while about this... I don’t who out there feels the same way also but is there way that certain videos can be sent to someone’s status without having to trim them in stages because it really takes up time esp. if it’s a min or two sometimes you have to just send the video link instead... Could you please do something about that limitation & give an update on that ASAP? 🎞️🤷🏽‍♂️
"It used to be great but sucks at transferring data. I wasted more than 30 hours to back up my information to move to a new device, and it was for no reason. Whatsapp support didn't help at all and made me feel like I'm stupid or wasn't trying everything they were telling me already. This used to be the best app for chatting with family but now I'm going to use something else. So highly disappointed, I've lost everything."
"It's nice o, buh I frown at the low features of the WhatsApp. It does indicate when a friend is _online_ It should separate friends chat from group chats...having different role for each...so that one can easily locate any chat or any group. If the features of Gb-WhatsApp can be included in this one, I believe it'll become more interesting.... Thanks. My WhatsApp keyboard has changed o, the place for another paragraph has changed to sent... And since, chats haven't been interesting 😩"
The app is much more secure than just about any other app out there still haven't gotten a straight explanation on how and where to retrieve the messages. This needs a rethink and going over to make it much more convient. So at this time because of that flaw especially in the business app it could negatively impact any businesses that needs and received messages. So thumbs down. Fix it gentleman.
"Great App, I'd recommend for any social media lover! The recent update on the app is really poor. You could make calls and still access other apps, what i don't understand is why there is now restriction on this feature. Secondly. People can still see and reply to a status update that was deleted. This doesn't align with the apps, privacy policy. I believe. All WhatsApp users would appreciate it, if these little flaws are fixed. Best Regards."
"This app has completely spoilt, to add recent pictures you have to click on the 3 dot line on the top and choose gallery before you can view the screen like it used to look and I cannot see how to make it stay in that view. What a terrible and pointless change. 🙄"
"First, WhatsApp is a must have messenger app here whole region. Second, the app works well..easy, multi features as a messenger app especially, broadcasting, assigned group communicating, now community this that..,external supports from other imperative apps (all in-app accessed), updates installed like on day-to -day schedule etc. Third and the greatest of all, it is totally free, no premium and it has perfectly all features even a premium can not compete with. I am decades user of WhatsApp."
"I don't know why whatsapp keep changing the settings and format frequently. Most of modifications were annoy and nonsense. The latest change was the sorting of contact persons. When I deleted the latest posted chat from someone's account, the someone wIll keep at the toppest sorting position (yesterday and before, the someone would be returned to previous sorting position)."
"TALK ABOUT GOING BACKWARDS. I had an old phone repaired and used a cheap one in the meantime. Went to download an old backup to find you can't do this now so, I've lost 8 years of chat history. Now can't register for 6 hours 40 minutes so, not even my customers can get through ro me!! Thank you WhatsApp. Great work you do!!!!!!!!!!"
The last two updates come with annoying issues when personalizing sounds for contacts. A real mess to the point that notification's sound plays along the recorded message or any incoming voice messages or calls. One stupid solution was to reinstall and not personalizing sounds for contacts.
"The volume can't be adjusted on a Tablet. This makes it very difficult to speak on calls. The tablet switches to portrait mode for calls. The handsfree mode on a tablet makes no sense. Overall, tablet support is very poor."
Mist ridiculous frustrating back-up and restore system. Why can't you back-up and restore your chats locally? Features are also behind every other good similar app. Hardly any new features ever added. Theming options are also ridiculously terrible. Only keep this app around because of a couple of my contacts.
"Overall good app but WhatsApp has a glitch that even if I have internet connection, I still can't send any messages. Some of my friends have also tried sending messages but it didn't work too. And if I call someone, it says that I don't have internet connection even though I do. Hope you can fix this glitch"
"Hello, The main function.. notifications are not working in what's application latest version. It is showing like, pop-up notification is not available in your android version. Dear devloper please resolve this issue. I will be thankful to you. I am a tech guy i have checked every possible way and contacting you finally. Kindly take action."
I switched to an older one plus phone. Since then every other day I get banned for an hour or two hours. It's just random. I don't even do marketing on whatsapp ..just communications. It's so annoying . I have uninstalled and reinstalled number of times. I lose all my texts! But this just keeps happening!
"I love WhatsApp a lot. The quality of the calls are good, the backgrounds and look is nice, and in general its a great app. There are regular but not too often updates and they always try to improve. BUT this app would be even more amazing and fun if we could and filters on the camera. Its would be great for people who arent allowes to have Snapchat or aby other Apps. Reply👍 if you agree"
Now this is a really good app but there are a few things I would like to be added! 1: I would love if you could make little avatars and I heard you might be doing that!! Also instead of the caption at the bottom it would be cool if u could move it and it be like snapchats! Speaking of Snapchat you should also add some filters that u can post on your status or just save them 😉 thanks for reading ! X
"This app is so frustrating. If i wanna upload pictures on my status, it takes up to 30 minutes most times, and if i wanna delete a post, it can take up to 2 hours and during that time, no messages will come in and i won't be able to send messages"
I haven't faced any problem yet using this app..i think it's very amazing the way it is.. Only a few features on privacy need to be updated as well as backing up of messages as it takes a long time to do so but keep it up..it's improving everyday.
"It gives me the opportunity to relate and communicate with people at a higher level even as a group to make better and easier contact with others,despite the challenges with the internet at times. Messages can be relayed at a faster paste."
"For some reasons my whatsapp is showing a few contacts that are nowhere saved on my phone. I tried reinstalling the app, changed permissions, resynced contacts but its still the same. How can I get rid of it ? I don't want to breach anyone's privacy as the phone numbers, display pictures and status for these UNKNOWN contacts are visible to me"
It's quite amazing app ... But now I'm going tell about a new feature... Sometimes I was writing a message but accidentally closed Whatsapp so my message that I was writing has been deleted ... So I thought if it has a feature that while writing a message if Whatsapp closed automatically then the message I wrote will be saved as draft it is quite usable... I hope you see my review and think about it... Thank you...
"Not sure if there is a bug, but I have just had Android 13 installed on my phone and now the only images I can attach to a message are images I have received through WhatsApp. There is a long-winded way to get to my gallery but it only displays photos, not videos. I now have to share the image/video directly from my gallery."
"Attachment options for pictures, no matter the method (in app) camera button, or paperclip, now only shows whatsapp photo folders, I then I have to hit Menu, then gallery. If I have already entered text and then do this method it also deletes the text after attaching. Please fix!"
"Can't attach photos from gallery. First thing that shows up when I click on the attach sign is whatsapp images instead of all albums. Then in the camera album, it won't let you select more than one image. Why change something that works?"
"Invasive ""backup"" notifications that can't be cleared, constant unwanted backups, and my account keeps getting messaged and called by scam accounts. Fix how how personal data is collected because it shouldn't be that easy for them to get in contact with me."
I think this app interface needs to be improved. For instance: 1. Contact chats and group chats should be put separately. 2. There should be a widget that helps users download photos from other people's status 3. There should also be customized texts and colors. As this helps users in generating their brand colors and text. 4. Incognito mode for preventing unwanted contacts from viewing wether you are active or not. 5. There should also be a widget to download texts from status.
From the last App Update WhatsApp Notifications and Notification Sound are not at all poping up. I have to open the Application to see the new messages and also there is no alert for them. This is a serious problem as from past 3 to 4 days this has started and since then there is no update pushed from WhatsApp. I request you to please resolve this issue soon.
"It's better the app stick to just texts; video calls are the worst, constantly ""reconnecting"" even when there's no signal issue in the area. Potential is present but it's up to you guys to improve."
It was fine and worked really well until the latest update. Now it's horrible to use. Bluetooth connections barely work and video call is impossible. You're better off using other apps at this point
They disabled the feature when you could play multiple voice messages in a row. This is dangerous when you have to listen messages while driving a car. Now you have to touch your phone to play every message and you could end up in an accident... SMH.
"All over app is good, but i would like you to fix the live location issue. The live location stops updating when the phone is locked. It should be continuously updating the location even if the phone is locked or the app is closed. It will be a really great update. I don't know if you read the reviews and actually take those suggestions. If you really read my review Whatsapp then do reply to it here."
I can't even access the app now. The past two days I've woken up to the opening screen with no progress past that. Ive reinstalled. Cleared cache. It'll work for a few hours after reinstall than nothing again. Started on Wednesday night
"This app constantly pauses or stops audio messages when I exit app and switch to another. Extremely annoying, it should continue to play audio messages regardless of whether I switch to another app or not, but continuously pausing messages every 2 seconds is infuriating."
No idea what's happened to WhatsApp but now it doesn't show my photos to send. It only shows media I share with other contacts. It's incredibly annoying when this my primary app for contact. Tempted to swap to something else if this isn't fixed.
This app is very good and there are a lot of things to like about this app but I am not going to talk about those I will talk about the things that can be improved and one big feature 1. It would be awesome if there were avatars you can keep. 2. I think you guys can add some animated emojis of ourself that can use the front camera of the phone 3. There can be a feature like you can send status to only some particular contacts. I hope these can be added quickly to WhatsApp
"If there was a zero, I would put it. Can't change contact name. Pictures took on the app is so trash. Loading is very slow even with good internet. Not getting all messages for notif. Always lagging. Better with telegram. So trash WhatsApp. Unless you change it base on my review which I think you won't since you people making this app is so useless."
"The microphone for voice recording isn't working. I noticed that after recording and sending, there's nothing to show for that because the microphone couldn't capture my voice. Please fix this, and maybe I'll add more stars. I already updated my WhatsApp too"
"After recent update I am facing following issues : 1. My DP is not visible to my contacts 2. I am not able to send many files. Even if the nuber of files is less than 30, a message is displayed that ""Can't send more than 30 files."" Solve the issue at the earliest."
"My experience so far using the app has been amazing, but I'd like to make a suggestion. Please make provision whereby one is able to block an individual in a group chat. Create an option where if one opens an individuals profile in a group chat, the ""block"" option will also be listed. If the command is set, both parties will not be able to see each other's comments or posts in a group chat, even if they respond to other people's comments in same group. Thanks."
great app. but I suggest to add some features: 1. If I see someone's status first and they send it to me via whatsapp then the media doesn't come to the gallery. Plz fix this 2. advanced privacy in showing the profile pic (ie. the person whom i want to include or exclude from contacts)
"The app is very good and help full app. Everyone can see is your google account. Dp, status and your available information. Everyone can voice call video call massage, voice message. And send upi and money send receive photos send receive. The app is most useful app .this app can is group study, discussion etc."
Ever since the update i can only send media that was previously downloaded via whatsapp only. Any media content and etc is not showing when i want to attach a particular media. The one showing available to attach is obly content that was shared via whatsapp before. E.g. screenshot is not showing as an available attachement. I have to go through gallery and select sharw via whatsapp
Phone's media not recognized after the latest update. You should fix that or at least tell us where we can fix that. It is very invovenient to go each time to the gallery to send an image instead of accessing it directly from whatsapp. This change should be mentioned in the update description. I WOULD NOT UPDATE IT IF I saw this change.
I am highly disappointed for the inconvenience in muting multiple contacts at once which was available with previous version but I found missing with this latest version. Now I have to mute one by one which takes a lot of time !!!
Om WhatsApp I'm not able to send videos to anyone I tried several times deleting and reinstalling the app to check for updates still it's the same problem. I talk to support and they were also not able to help me. It is awful and the worst experience.
"Your problem is making this app unusable when out of date. Some marginalized people like us will not be able to update it instantly as soon as you release a new version. Allow it to work and notify users of the new update, they can update if they like the new features. Some people are just here for text, audio and video calling and not worried about who last did what where."
"This is a very simple and easy to use app with recent and relevant updates. However, kindly consider giving group admins the capacity to create a broadcast list out of groups. I think the recent feature only supports creating a community. This is necessary because some group members pay swift attention to direct messages compared to group charts. As well, group charts are most likely to be flooded with irrelevant messages and thus some group members miss out on relevant information. etc."
"I love the creativity and innovation of the app! It'd really be nice if the ""archives"" can not be at the top of the chats' page. We archive chats for a reason, if you know what I mean😉. They can appear in the settings as a ""go-to"" option. Thanks in anticipation!"
Worked fine until the last update and now it won't let me share photos from my gallery... only shows all the images that have already been sent through the app in different threads... can't send multiple photos and won't let me send videos at all... absolute shambles!
"I don't know why and how, but I cannot send pictures/videos/audios anymore because of the new update. Maybe It's because of my phone but this happened when I updated the app. Please fix this immediately. I want to share pictures/videos/audios to my friends and family again."
"I have noticed a problem on WhatsApp. Whenever I share a photo from my gallery on WhatsApp status, it's displaying that the photo doesn't exist in my internal storage. But when I check internal storage, then I can see the photo. Please try to fix this issue as soon as possible. I think it's happening because of some bug. Thanks in advance."
"Good app, but I could suggest some app-changing features: 1. We should be able to see others' messages' informations, and not just ours. 2. It's so annoying when you chat with someone, and then automatically the next day, all messages self-destroy, can you please fix that? That is all, thank you for your care."
"The WhatsApp service is very sound and clear to the extent of the voice call is also very clear with out cracking, so the network very fantastic and serve as fast in browsing and gives excellent service. , The voice call sounds also very clear and the video call also have a service and give neat , only the voice call at times hangout without hearing the opposite well Thanks"
"Used to work. Now Bluetooth connection broken. I've followed all the online advice and the permissions for nearby devices are not asked for. Everything otherwise works fine, so I suspect it's not asking for a permission it needs, or not updated for the latest OS."
Horrible experience when switching from one phone to another. Lost all the chats and some contacts. Why make this transit from old phone to new one such a trouble. You should learn from telegram where everything works smooth and fast with no need to do back up or anything at all
After update I can only select images from what has been sent on this app. If I want to send something that has not I need to navigate to my photo album and from there I can send only one at a time. Further more I am unable to send videos this way as well. What kind of lame update is this ?
"Updates fail all the time, and it takes too much time. I play voice messages, but can barely hear them, my screen goes black and when i ""unlock"" it, it freezes until the end of message"
"it's been all whacky recently. When I scroll up, it skips to mf 1982 messages, when someone sends a video I can't watch it because its frozen to the first frame and won't start playing and messages sometimes take forever to send, sometimes just don't."
"Love the app, it awesome but I just have one problem, that I think need urgent attention, there is no media setting for video quality, there is only one for photos and its really annoying when you post a video and the quality get reduced, unlike other sociah media apps,hope its gets fix with the next update"
"If anyone is sending me some photos, it automatically gets deleted. The same is happening with me in messages as well. If someone is sending me a message, then those messages are getting deleted automatically. This is happening ever since I updated WhatsApp. Please tell me some solution for this. Overall it's a good app. But since the new update has come, there is a lot of trouble. This should be resolved as soon as possible."
"It is an exceptional app, since it makes messaging cup of tea for everyone. The only little problems that i have are as follows - 1. Before the latest update, It was hanging and bugging when i type something after an emoji, the keyboard would just freeze. 2. Please improve the photo system. I am glad you are so friendly and obedient with your audience... And the new updates are what the public demanded, so good job 👏"
"Idk why it did always worked on Galaxy note 20 with no problem.Now on Galaxy S22 ultra it's having a lots of issues.Not able to send video files anymore WTH 😭, tech support has no idea what is going on ☹️, ""Fail to process video , please try again later or restart your phone"" that's what I'm getting probably for 3 months now , restarting phone doesn't help, those new updates doesn't help either. Recently got several updates but still doesn't work I don't know what's going on"
"Its fantastic ! The features and all other stuffs goes well . I should say too good BUT I thing something needs to be added : as we can turn off the last seen , we should have a option to turn off the online / offline mode seen by others of ours .. not only i but many other want this ..thats it nothing else"
"What do you developers do? While sending any photo, its quality gets reduced significantly (even when the quality is set to ""best""). Please, please, 'please' give some heed to this comment and kindly add an option to send photos in their 'exact original' quality."
"before the update i have no issues with the PiP feature, but after the update i have issue with the PiP while I'm in video call. my window will always located in the right bottom corner and it can't move even though when in full screen i moved it to another corner. it's really annoying. please fix it"
"In the recent 2 update i have observed the some issue with the app. These are few pointers 1.when i am on whatsapp call i will be unable to play hotstar and amazon prime videos or other ott platforms except youtube. 2. When I am on whatsapp call and then i call through my phone's dialer then I won't be able hear the voice of another party and when I resume the whatsapp call it override on dialer and make the direct call on hold. So, ,now i think there is really something wrong in the app."
Whenever i sent a voice message it doesn't show those wavy things on the voice message and it also have some delays when i press the voice button to record a voice message. It's so annoying. I really-really hope that the developer would take this issue seriously and put out an update to slove this issue
"All is good but, Major problem is when we upload status or share a video clips of mobile camera recorded ,that might losing an original recorded clarity when we've use to share or upload a status. That's an issue for all of us. Please fix them as soon as possible."
"I love the app so much, but I will like it if you could add more status fonts, emojis and status background colour, and maybe the background could be mixed with some things and not just plain background.... And make it possible to join photos And for security, pin, passwords and pattern, should be enabled. Also create more wallpaper themes for whatsApp, Thanks"
"Usually in the status privacy i could only share with nobody, as in not picking a contact at all and i think that was a wonderful thing. Until the newest update... apparently it forces me to pick a contact and if i dont choose it will use the previous contact list. Why are you forcing me to share my private status to people? I am literally a minor. Atleast make a nobody feature for the status privacy."
Slowly but added new features but if i compare with other chat application then WhatsApp is under in midrange level. Some feature that should be in it. 1) exceed video file size 16mb(not mention document file) 2) added privacy to show profile picture *Only show* Not to *My contact except* 3) added Airplane Mode to swith off Whatsapp.
"It's free. Fortunately, people in my region, the entire mobile phone users, have this messenger app installed and used as first choice communication tool even as compared to phone app. All features in the app work great and very helpful, simple and complete."
Uploading photos has been difficult. I can't open up my normal gallery with phone only folders. if i took photos or screenshot something recently and want to send to someone. It end up showing folders of people name who i spoken to on whatsapp. This newer update made it difficult now.
"After you updated, things got worse. All my data was backed up and deleted, when I log in again, it asked me for a password, I didn't give any password, after the new update, I need to give a password to restore the backup, is this a system, first when I backed up it was Gmail. No password is required with the number, you are deleting all the people's data like this."
"Partner has the new single view image update, which means her version is protected against screenshots. But my version is not. So now we cannot use single view *at all* - it just says I need to update the app but there is no update available. Broken feature."
"For people who can no longer access their photos...go into permissions in the settings, scroll down to not allowed and change your camera and photo settings, I haven't been able to send them since the update but this seems to have fixed it!"
"There are many glitches with backup and restoration process and I lost my huge and important data and there was no proper response from whatsapp. The process of generate password is also not reliable, you can lose your data there as well. Best to have minimum features with proper stability and testing of it."
"Status review feature is very annoying. When we click on reply, to really reply or to pause a status, it often mistakenly clicks on the quick emoji reactions. Instead do this- when we click on an qick reaction emoji, don't directly send it. Put it in the reply section and then once sure, we can manually click send button to send it"
"Right now, I'm not able to send any message to any one this situation started after 12.30 PM of today. All the other apps are running freely except WhatsApp. Latest update have transferred archive from down to up, which is quite unhealthy because any one can open it from up. So if developers can provide a choice for users where they want to keep archive, it would be beneficial for us. Apart from that, they can give us private mode, too. Where we can put important chate safe."
Not Good on Pixel 7 Pro. The camera button in WhatsApp doesn't take as clear pictures as the camera is capable of taking. Particularly on the front facing camera which doesn't have a focus function at all in WhatsApp but also on the rear facing camera. It's far better to take photos in the camera app then click share and go to WhatsApp that way.
"Whatsapp is good and convenient communication app but some features are missing. I request you to add notification bubble feature for better and easy reply and secondly, whatsapp upload only 30 seconds video in status. Please upgrade the time limit."
"The autocorrect has become ridiculous. When did you decide that you should change the word even if its spelt correctly? I cannot physically count the amount of times I've written ""I love you"" with no typos and WhatsApp changes it to ""I live you"". And that's just 1 example. Do you think I don't have the mental capacity to type the word I want? If there's a mistake in the word then autocorrect is useful. BUT DONT CHANGE THE WORD IF THERES NO MISTAKE. Whoever came up with that idea should be fired"
"this application has problems. it's not possible that messages in a group chat were delivered to me almost 24 hours later just because someone wrote me in private while i've been online various times during those 24 hours. fix this issue. i am a student on stage and i missed one day because of you. i use this app almost everyday because people use it as the main chat app and don't even know what sms are anymore. so, in my case, it's important that whatsapp notifies me immediately. thanks."
The clarity of the pictures reduce somehow when sent through WhatsApp. Picture quality remains same only if pictures are converted to pdf. But this process is not know to everyone. It would be good if this problem is fixed.
"Why have you changed the image selection flow? Now it's close to impossible to attach photos captured from the camera. Attach - gallery is the flow I am referring. Once gallery opens ""all media"" only shows media present in WhatsApp, instead of showing all the captured photos"
"It's my favorite way of communicating with family and friends... it's free, quick and easy...calls may fail sometimes but understandably so due to the fact that millions of people are using the app at the same time...besides that it's effortless."
"Most annoying thing about this app is the function that allowes people to add you to groups without your consent. You can leave the group ofcourse, but than u get into socially awkward conversation as to why you left. You can block the group but than you still see messages piling up. I mean, there has to be a way to make a function that asks if you want to join a group or not. Or just get rid of groups all togethe"
Don't like that it changes my parameters/ settings when I update. Plus seems to use a lot of mgb to do so even though it only takes 30secs- 1 min to do so. I have lost contacts & other critical information when I have updated previously.
"I can't see the number of messages in the whatsapp icon anymore, and this means I don't see that I have new messages when I open my phone and I miss some important timely messages this way. This makes the app much less useful."
Also having issues with my photos. Anything I receive now no longer shows in my gallery. I've checked my settings. All happened after I updated. I'm scared to loose my pictures that I've received. How do I fix it
"Hi, my name is Ryan Brown and I have a samsung galaxy s20 phone. I am having problems with WhatsApp. When I send messages to people it keeps taking ages to send the messages even though I have WiFi or mobile data on , so basically it would come up with the loading timer thing. Please send an update to fix this."
"Force ""new"" versions. A lot of nonsense updates, but still we can't restrict sending voice messages to ourselves. Please, improve. Imagine someone starts to record a voice message to you and gets a pop-up ""this user restricted voice messeging"" instead. How awesome would that be?"
"Love what's app. Love recording voice message feature where you can hear the person's voice in a text. Quicker to record than typing for me too. Love how you can swipe a person's comment from above so that person knows what text you're commenting on. Overall, wonderful app."
"My account was blocked suddenly without even a notice stating some random reason which is unacceptable. Have been using it for several years, you can't just block it as it's an important way of communication I request to review and do the needful"
This app is becoming rubbish I can't increase volume of sound while watching a status and it keeps glitching every single time Your Video cannot play every single time I'll be trying to Increase the volume of the video watching a Status it will just show and stay the same actually telegram is better than WhatsApp this has changed my whole point of view
"Overall the app is fantastic. Everything is good but there is a need of one more thing in this app. The thing is there should be an apk file send option in files sending option. When we send image, audio or location etc there should be one more option of applications apk file."
It is a lot of fun using WhatsApp. You can message anyone anytime! It is very helpful when you doesn't have balance in your mobile it helps me a lot of time. messaging my friends family members by just a few mb minutes. It easy!
"I have just been introduced to Whatsapp by one of my nephews in the military also have another nephew in the military. I especially enjoy sending texts to them with a religious GIF. Evertime I have sent a text with a GIF the ""word"" ""GIF"" transfers right in the middle of the image. I have investigated this problem & tried several recommended methods. Please tell me how send the GIF with a text or correct this problem. Thank you for your assistance."
"Not that great, lost its charms and useful functions after the update and now it's just a hassle to use. Also, with the low range of media support, it's just bad."
"Although WhatsApp is very popular and easy to use, sometimes one or two functions does not work properly. For example, the emojis and GIFs does not appear when try to view it.......I hope we find a solution to this problem soon."
Everything is fine but the pop up notification is blocked because it say for the Android 9 and older version won't receive notification on the notification bar. Please fix it!! Honestly I regret losing the older version!!
"There's a new problem with the last upgrade. If I want to see their profile pic: After tapping someone's profile picture, if they uploaded their status, the app takes me to their status, not to the profile I want to see."
"Let us choose if we want *status* to load automatically or not. The data usage is unbearable for me as I have many contacts. Also, introduce ""filter by unread messages"" Thanks."
"the app isnt allowing me to send voice recordings or take pictures using the camera icon on the app after i updated i had all these issues! i have given permission to whattsapp through android and its still not working ive updated, ive rebooted and reinstalled app and phone this is ridiculous never had issues before!"
"It works fine, but after the most recent update, i have sent texts to a few people 30 mins ago, but those texts haven't been sent yet. There's no network problem because every other online app is working fine. I need this issue to be solved immediately, I have urgent things to do."
"The new update is terrible. Can't share many photos at a time anymore... And moreover, I have to click to so many places to freaken find photos from my gallery. Please change this back the way it 2as before."
"This has been fine for years, and now it's really frustrating to send images from the gallery. Can't get to them in the easy manner I could before, and I can't send more than one at a time. Considering thats most of what I use it for, not impressed."
This was great but I can't send vidoes anymore to anyone for the past few weeks. Redownloaded the app maybe times but when I try to send a video it keeps telling me to restart my device. Plus I have data backup that all disappeared or won't load
One of my family member has an account with WhatsApp and the account is put on hold saying that there is unusual activity in the account. I have tried to contact customer support via whatsapp group and email numerous times and no matter what I tell them the there is no response from them. Never thought what's app support would be that careless and dumb.
"I found this new application useless, if you mobile phone break down and you need to open in another device that no necessarily is a mobile phone, you won't be able to open it. Like in my case I have only a tablet and I can't scan that code to open my WhatsApp because my mobile phone is broken."
I have same issue so i went to my settings and allow my camera and video access to the app then now i can easily select pictures and videos to put on status and and sending to contacts now i no longer need to go back to my gallery and select stuff to send. Hope this helps👍
"Ever since latest update. Can't upload photos from Gallery via the app anymore, it doesn't appear and only shows WhatsApp media images (you have to select an option to bring up the images). Very inconvenient."
It is good until you need to move from Android to iOS. There is no way to move your chat history once the iPhone device is set up. Only paid 3rd party tools are available. Why don't you make it possible to restore Google drive backup regardless of the device type?
"Very useful for communication and we (users) benefit lot using this revolutionary technology. There are added benefits as this app keeps abreast with new facilities/features. The users feel very close with their relatives, friends, colleagues, their groups, etc. even they are in different continents. Best wishes for this app and it's management to grow more in useful way to the management and the users."
When I am on a video call buttons doesn't work after minimizing the screen and comming back to full screen mode this should be fixed . there should be a remove option to remove participant as sometime if i am talking with my grand parents they don't know how to disconnect the call so every time to remove them we all have to disconnect the call and reconnect. so you should add a remove participant option so we need not to disconnect it. overall features are good
"Why am I not getting notifications when I get messages?? I turned the option on in the app settings, but still nothing. Only way I know if I have a message is if I constantly monitor the app. It's very frustrating.."
Excellent App! But you have to add a new feature music to a status. When we add our status on WhatsApp their should be a new feature showing of Music which we put on our photos and videos. Thanks! I hope that you will add this amazing feature on WhatsApp..🙂🙂
OK the reason I'm doing this a 4 star is because the quality of the calls are outrageous I swear every time I call my friends they can never hear me and I can never hear them and if they share their screen or well at least show their video then everything just is super bad quality I don't know if it's about my Internet but also I have a really strong connection so I don't think it is my Internet please fix this if you can.
"Crappie after the latest update. No longer able to attach photos from your gallery without clicking top right and selecting gallery. Instead, just get a random selection of photos. Please sort this out was fine until the last update!"
"The bugs after the last update has been frustrating me. I can't open links sent in chats. It says ""You may not have the proper app for viewing this content"". Please fix this, I am frustrated!!!"
"After the new update, I am having problems during video calls. My video is always muted after pausing the video call by pressing the back button and returning to the video call again. Please fix it."
"Video calls and voice calls not getting connected after the recent update, can't even attach a image from the attachment menu, have to dig into gallery and attach a file or image to send, messages working pretty fine"
"Recent update is annoying. Now when I open the app, all my whatsapp contacts are there, along with all my contacts whom aren't using the app, and it asks me to invite them. These are landline only numbers and sometimes I only have an email address. How the hell am I supposed to invite them? It's so stupid. I don't want to invite anyone!! Don't ask me to. I only want to see my contacts which are already using the app."
"It's a great app ...but these days I have been having issues with receiving certain messages.... Idk what the problem is . Instead of receiving those messages I get "" u received a message but your version of WhatsApp doesn't support it..UPDATE WHATSAPP"" but when I come here to update the app ..there's no update...what's the problem???"
"I hate to update whatsapp everytime because I am aware it only brings something worst. Moving all chats from one phone to another has been nighmare. I have lost my chats so many times I forgot the count. Recently, I couldn't open a pdf document so the app forced me to update the app to open Pdf and we are still on not reading the pdf after the update."
After the latest update the new way to share media is AWFUL!! Why mess with a good thing?! The way it was before was perfect. It's so frustrating now and makes me not want to use WhatsApp. Hope this gets fixed or reverted back to how it was before ASAP.
"I am currently having a problem with receiving voice notes. It says downlaod failed. And it also does the same with status updates of people, download failed. That's what it says. This is the problem I am having with this app right now and I updated the app yesterday."
"Absolutely terrible experience recently. Calls are dropped, voice is cut all the time. Can't complete a single call without any interruption. I wish I could switch over to another app."
Overall its a nice app to use but in android there is a problem your backup photos and videos will blur after few months if you turn off the save photos and videos to gallery option. But in apple photos and video remains forever with backup. Whatsapp android version would like be the iphone whatsapp version. That is why 4 stars to whatsapp android version.
Had a good experience with this app. I don't use other social medias very often. But the live location map has so much delay. Sometimes it doesn't even move. Pls do something bcz i so much relive on this feature
"After recent update, I am not able to even start the app. As soon as I open the app, within few seconds the app automatically shuts down. Kindly resolve this error as soon as possible"
"The app is good but the feature end-to-end password reset time is unacceptable. We can wait long for restoration of chat backup. Please remove the ""waiting time boundation"" from the end-to-end password during entering wrong password. I can not wait also nobody wants to wait in this segment during restoring chat. 2 stars only. 😏😏"
Latest update has broken photo sharing functionality. As others have pointed out in recent reviews it's no longer possible to easily share images from your phone. I can only assume this is a bug but I've no idea how to report it so I guess we just have to hope they fix it and release an update
"This app is very nice,and excellent features but i want a feature that we can send message at a certain time. Like at 11:00am we want to send a message but i sleep so,i just set the message and it automatically send at 11:00am . Grant my request. Thank you :)"
Fix the pictures or videos sending error/issue. Can't see the latest captured videos in the gallery if we wanna send them directly from the chat untill we get it sent through anybody else and have that in the whatsapp folder. 😠😠😠
"I had good experience with this application but nowadays, the problem i am facing is that Whenever i receive messages i do not get notifications until i open whatsapp. As well as during video call i makes error on using bluetooth earphones.I hope you will pay attention to this review of mine."
"Used to be so reliable but after recent update, it is harder to attach photos from gallery and also unable to select multiple. I had to share via gallery app instead on attaching in WhatsApp message. Please fix it."
"When I'm receiving a view once photo from someone, it shows as 'you received a message but your version of whatsapp doesn't support it' with an option to update whatsapp when no update is available. This didn't happen before. Please look into the issue."
"Having issyes with the latest update. Not showing the full gallery when attaching images or videos from within the app. When selecting the gallery option from 3 dots, able to select only one photo or video. Please fix the issue quickly."
"What lame developers! I'm supposed to verify my phone number, but they put a popup over the entry field that takes me away before I can verify my phone number. Their help is halfa$$, it tells you WHAT to do, but not how to get there. The ""call back"" link in their help isn't a link. And you can't just type in a number to dial yourself for verification, you have to make yourself a contact first. And that's just in the first two minutes of installing this horrible app. Gee could you get any worse?"
"I wrote this review below, months ago Only one complaint has been rectified.......that messages can be deleted after more than 1 hour! Can't edit, cannot delete after 1 hr, cannot delete individuals messages sent via broadcast. Telegram has all these advantages, and more, that's why Telegram is becoming more popular!"
"It is a great app for exchanging our thoughts, ideas and memories. But, you can add an text/message edit feature so that it helps to understand the content. Because, some times we may miss any word or sentance in the text which might look unrealistic or unreadable at the receiver end. I request development team to make this change."
"After recent update i am unable to take ot make audio and video calls as screen gets stuck on ""Connecting"" but never connects. Though on wifi it works perfect."
"I have only one suggestion, hope it will be considered. I want WhatsApp to enable deletion and editing of messages sent without time restrictions and without notifying the receiver about it. We are all humans we make mistakes sometimes you would send a detrimental, insulting, derogetory, or an erroneous message that you'd regret a fraction of second after hitting the sent button. If implemented, it will go along way in improving relationships, businesses, etc. Thank you."
Very worst method in forget password for two step verification . It took mor then a week. I hate this email method. It will easy and helpful when you give other way of recovery password. Otherwise it's irritating to get after long time more than 10 days.
"I have been temporarily banned 5 times in the past 48 hours, and I have been in contact with the whatsapp support team (which proved to be a futile exercise). They told me my app version was unapproved, from which I uninstalled and reinstalled the app - twice - yet the issue keeps persisting. As I am typing this I have, yet again, been banned and no one is telling me how to fix this issue. This is very inconvenient as I use whatsapp to communicate with my employer."
"Since the last update, the camera turned off in the middle of the video call and i have to turn it on again and again during the video call. Also just like others complaining about the access to the gallery n stuff. Please fix this"
"I want to report WhatsApp a bug or whatever that... Once I send a reply of a status and if it is a video then the music starts playing in background.. I hope you will see this comment and work upon this... Else the animations in this latest version is awesome, I just loved those"
"Recent WhatsApp updates are totally waste of time.....it can not update the contact with recent chatting orders. If I delete some chat than beside going back to its actual time frame ,it show on the top of list."
An update should cause improvements not make things worse. 1 star until they fix the photo issue that everyone is having. Or they could just keep this up while people switch to other platforms.
"Awesome app! I can't believe I've waited so long to download it! I wish more family and friends used it, so I could use it more often. This app has a crisp & simple interface. So user-friendly and a pleasure to navigate. I recommend this app to everyone. Best-kept secret in the world of communication apps!"
"Contacts are not arranged on the basis of date but actually arranged on the basis of active chat that is not convenient ,but in previous version is according to date so it's an issue if I delete some chat but their contact seen in recent actions plzz resolve it."
Had a very good experience with this app.but after recent update chat history is not working properly as if someone deleted some chats ofa particular contact it does not goes down from screen as it was before but shows on the screen which is creating problem.....kindly set it as it was before🙏🏻
As much as I love WhatsApp..I was so disappointed to be blocked for 3hours citing that I was using an illegal version..which is not true.. I have been using WhatsApp since it was launched with regular updates and changes when I moved to another country. It suggested to go to the Google store to get the correct version.. which is exactly where I am right now. It raises suspicion about the controls that they have in place.
Since last 2 updates. 1. Repeatedly ends with microphone error message 2. Accesses microphone in the background when not on calls. 3. The sounds cuts out repeatedly when on calls both voice and video. Mostly NON FUNCTIONAL.
I have not been able to post full length videos like I used to. I'm limited to 11 minute videos which results in me having to edit the videos and post in sections. I may as well use the text app on my phone.
"Update 10/24/2022 I have recently switched to another phone. WhatsApp is unable to restore messages from backup. After 24% of restoring, it crashes. Phone:- S22 Ultra. I have tried almost a hundred times. The same problem persists."
"This version of WhatsApp is just useless. Immediately i play a voice note sent to me, my phone light will turn off... So it doesn't give me the opportunity to control or fast forward the voice note. Do something about it ASAP, I don't really like this version at all. Thanks"
"great app, been using it for MANY years now. Not many complaints really, other than the odd problem I have with the camera; if I want to record a video with the flash, I can't, the flash just doesn't come on? But it does for photos? It's very annoying. And another problem is sometimes when I want to shorten a video it doesn't work and just keeps playing from the original start and shutting down and reopening the app doesn't fix it. Other than that, amazing app, I use it on the daily basis. :)"
"At this moment my whatsapp keeps on closing, glitching and kicking me out. I've deleted re - installed it and done every possible thing google said to do and it's not working. I needed this to be sorted out like yesterday. Please assist me asap as I need it for university and work. This is a major inconvenience."
"When I receive a floating notification in Whatsapp while watching a video in full screen, the combination of translucency of the notification window together with black font make it incredibly hard to read the message. Yet, the notification window still does a good job of obstructing a part of the video. A much better job than of showing the message. I would have tried to tweak the translucency, the font color to achieve better results, but there doesn't seem to be such an option 🙃"
"Unfortunately, the new update has added a glitch that has narrowed the space to view when searching for gifs to ridiculously small. I tried to contact them on this but doesn't seem no-one wants to know, so downgraded it. The app was suprisingly very easy to use and setup, it's no wonder why it's so popular and is a great way to share photos and videos! I will strongly recommend this and those who haven't yet tried it, to put aside their fears and give it a go!!! There is no registration needed!"
"Hi, I've been using this since the beginning, and the simplicity is the best feature. Now with so many updates and upgrade, some just feel annoying. 1. The reaction to the message. It keep appearing on my notification window until I open the message. When I send hundreds broadcast and they reply with reaction, imagine that I have to reopen them one by one because I can't mark them as read."
"I've been using the app for a few years now. Normally, whatever the bug was, it was resolved pretty quickly within 2-3 days. But exactly a week ago, the contacts' names on my whatsapp disappeared and were replaced by their numbers. App is updated, phone is updated, and contacts are synced. A little frustrating because I need to carefully check I'm sending the correct messages to the intended party. I hope this issue gets resolved soon. Thank you."
I think it would be perfect if I can access Whatsapp on several (or at least 2) gadgets. It is a lil bit uncomfortable for me to switch from Android to iOS and vice versa since the interface looks so different. Maybe it will help a lot if I can access on both as I learn to understand and familiarize myself with the new device. Please consider this.
"Whatsapp is a good app for texting, calling, and finding people. You can make group chats with lots of people and call multiple people at once. Even if two users have different types of phones, pictures will still send clear."
"It's not perfect, I get that. I've just been having issues with the voice notes and occasionally the call feature. Both have bombed out either when I start or halfway through. I'm hoping that a ""clean"" installation will hopefully resolve this issue for me. ———Update——— After patiently waiting, WhatsApp promising they're looking into the voice note recording issue and and then closing it. I'm disappointed to say, 2 updates later and still the same result with no feedback on progress or cause."
"Overall the best messaging app I've ever used, it's easy to use, free and uses WiFi to message, when connected. But I'd like it if you could make it so that if you call someone but they don't answer/decline they could leave a reason why they didn't answer/decline, and you could leave a reason why you called and vice versa. I'd also like it if you could make status videos longer, so like 1 min/1 min 30 sec instead of 30 sec. And you can send any type of video and it won't just say can't send. Thx"
"Good messaging app. The fact that you can choose more than around five reactions is pretty great. What's still missing is the possibility to add more than one profile pic, which would be amazing since, the way I see it, it's usually not easy to abandon an image you've had for, let's say, months. Even a maximum of 5 would be enough. Apart from that, keep it up."
"Keeps crashing with a org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserException error when I do a long press on picture sharing mode. Customer support is useless as I sent 13 e-mails, sent screenshots, explained that I already restarted my device/reinstalled/updated WhatsApp and all they do is send some generic unhelpful replies. Says compatible Android 4.1+, and I have Android 4.4.4. Really a disgrace that you don't test your app properly on versions you state as supported. Not everyone can afford latest phone."
Overall its a good app. But when I'm on call with my friends it always reconnects even tho my WiFi is strong? It's really annoying when we are trying to keep track when how long we called but whatapp just ruins that's by reconnecting when both ends wifi is strong and stable
"Whatsapp was very a good app. BUT, you need to improve your features like add some options to create folder for chats. In example, me as student has many group for classes, and we used Whatsapp as our main platform to connect to each other.But unfortunately, when Whatsapp doesn't have that kind of features, it made my WhatsApp app looked messy. i hope that you can improve your features just like TELEGRAM as well. Tq."
"Until today, WhatsApp has been brilliant. But then my phone updated and WhatsApp isn't working for me any more. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, checked all my permissions etc. Same thing happened to a friend recently, what is going on??? 😢 I need the app to keep in touch with family across the planet. Any suggestions?"
"Overall it's a perfect messenger.... But after Android 13 update, fonts are not getting bold even after its bold enabled in settings. Please resolve it as soon as possible."
"I feel very bad experience because after update one major problem I am facing with is about the tick issue, before it was okh but now when the alternative person seen the message sent by me after that also showing single tick similarly when the person is online the send message was also showing single tick rather then double ,i think it was the most annoying thing , please @whatsapp fix this issue."
U Come wth diffrent updates but nothing sooo diffrent n what's the use if there is no option of exit or leave or who can send or add us to broadcast list..u shud come up wth these options on broadcast too as group options n features...there is no option we can remove ourselves if other person has added on their broadcast...sooo many updates but this is as is it...And that green circle around profile picture is not showing...
"I feel it'd be better if WhatsApp added this to their next update, which is while listening to music on a Bluetooth device and when opening whatsapp status at the same time, videos shouldn't interrupt the music playing, unless you want to listen to the sound of the video, then you click any of the volume buttons to listen to video sound, or an option should be provided after clicking the three dots at the top right of the screen while viewing WhatsApp status to unmute the video's sound."
"Your recent update enables users to see status by clicking on profile picture from chats, but when i clicked on a profile picture then reclicked it to see it then i was thrown to that contact's status. Happen with contacts that have posted a status."
"I love the app. It's good. But it would be really greater if a chat could be created for 'saved messages' as we on Telegram, where one can save info, recording, and messages, to be sent later and not immediately."
"WhatsApp is a nice application. I am enjoying your free services. Please, the recent update that changed the position of the 3 icons on the status page to the top right corner is not ideal for mobile devices. Stretching up there to select the desired theme of status is not necessary. Thank you."
"With the last update they made unnecessarili complicated the image sharing. The phone gallery is somewhat hidden, requiring more steps to access it. Plus, it's not possible to share more than 1 image at once."
"Ever since the latest update, it repeatedly crashes, does not allow me to send voice messages anymore, and keeps saying storage full when it's not even close."
"Very helpful, nice, powerful app for chatting and sharing data. But nowadays there is a big in WhatsApp as follows :- If we are viewing any video on status and then go to home suddenly, then the audio is still playing behind."
Return whatsapp features as before. Now I find it difficult to post recent videos / photos that taken from outside WhatsApp. Please bring this feature back. The current feature is very troublesome and annoying. Please. Return it or we'll change it to TELEGRAM
"It used to be simple and efficient since not everyone is tech savvy. However, like everything Facebook gets their paws into turns to garbage fast. Constant updates that don't make it easier or fix things, just for changes"
"It doesn't work,it used to but now it doesn't I tried to download it more than 5 times today but still it doesn't work and it doesn't allow me to download a new one or send it.I tried to find the problem but it seems like there is no problem with it and for sure the problem is not my phone too cause it's brand new, it doesn't have any difficulties with other apps."
"It was working perfectly on my samsung, now it change and for some reason when i go to send pictures now it doesn't show all the pictures like before, its becoming super annoying, now i have to go to the gallery to send pictures one by one, why did it change??? Please change it back!"
App can be more efficient if an email is attached with it for recovery.in case if we lost the number we can access to whatsapp through email. Also one more feature can be added that is message request. If any unknown person send us message it should have an option to check the message without the sender knowing.
I've noticed after the most recent app the camera on video calls switches from portrait to landscape mode for the person I am talking to and zooms in an extreme amount.
Thanks for the app. Very useful and efficient. I would like to suggest a feature that I would really like to see and I think would be very useful. Can you make a way to mention all members of a group at once? Something like @All ? That would be time saving instead of mentioning all names. Thanks for your consideration!
All good but when you send a video or photo on status it got blur which is a severe issue...Kindly it's a humble request to Whatsapp as soon as possible resolve this issue!!! Also react Option to Whatsapp status 😆cux most of times we're not in mood to reply on Whatsapp status but we have to show that your(2nd person) status matter to us...
"Love WhatsApp. Have been using it since it started. Although, I didn't come here to actually review though. I came here to ask if something is possible. A schedule send option for WhatsApp, don't know if it makes sense for a lot of people. But I think people using WhatsApp for work, an update like this might come in handy. Rather than remembering to send something in the morning, why not schedule it off in the night. Please do tell me if it's possible or even if it's not. Thankyou!"
I don't know why but it seems like every time I fix it so that I can get my sound notices it's goes back to its old way and I can't get my notices for my when I get a text from.my friend. This is very upsetting because I don't want to have to constantly keep an eye on the phone just to get a notice for my friend when I hear from him. I really hope this issue can be resolved now it's done it again so I got to figure out why it keeps changing and stopping
From last 3 4 weeks when iam going to update my profile it's getting blur and also when iam putting status of pictures which I captured in my phone also getting blur in the status please sort out this problem as soon as possible. Except this app was very good and it's updations was absolutely nyc....
"1. BRING BACK THE OLD VERSION OF WHATSAPP WEB, THE LATEST UPDATE WAS LAGGY AF, NO ON CARES ABOUT USING IT WHILE BEING OFFLINE, WE JUST WANT TO ACCESS QUICKLY 2. UPDATE THE SYNCING PRICESS between Contacts app & WhatsApp (I've edited some contacts & add new numbers in contacts app but nothing changed in the whatsapp app) 3. Can't screenshot only-once photos anymore :("
"Can't log in to my account. Try many times, install and uninstall again n again, when initializing it's always unable to connect and force me to check status while status system is normal and my internet speed is pretty fast, around 3,5Mbps. Please fix this. I have so many important thing and work to do in this app."
"I wanted to go and see messages based on specific date, but this feature not available yet. If I want to go specific date, I have to scroll many times. It would be helpful to us, if you give updated with this feature. Thanks in advance"
"Well, i believe there's something wrong after recent update. WhatsApp has temporarily banned my account for no reason two times since yesterday. People might have something important going on and all of a sudden getting banned and waiting for an hour with no option to open it is just annoying. Slowly moving my communications to Telegram."
"Very good app which makes one communicate with friends and loved ones through videos, images, etc. The only shortfall is its upgrade which disallows some handsets to have access to the app to operatewith ease."
WhatsApp is not 100% safe and it does share your data and read personal data.based on your data it also sends you unneccessary advts and offers.the msges are not end encrypted as stated by them. You can find it out from the advts and msges you get after your conversations. All policies are one sided and one has to either agree to them or simply not use the app.
"Messaging is fine, features are alright... But JESUS MARY AND JOSEPH (and the wee donkey)... Taking a picture is awful. Both on my old OnePlus 8T and my current Pixel 7 Pro, the images have the *worst* output. My friend sent me a picture of white chocolate (on a Pixel 7 Pro) and it came out pink 😦. I regularly close the app, take whatever picture I need/want in the native camera app for far superior results, and then share in whatsapp. @Meta, try harder!"
"Of the major messaging apps, WhatsApp is probably the most reliable, feature packed, and widely used, meaning most of your contacts likely already use it. If I have any gripes about WhatsApp, it's that I wish it had more backup options with different cloud services other than Google Drive on Android and iCloud on iPhone."
"Whatsapp app after update wont let me play any media in the background if im in whatsapp call. And only whatsapp did this. Any videos would stop and says ""this video cannot be played bcs another application is using the audio"" it works fine before but after updating it, it became like this. Fix it!!!"
Was working perfectly up until recently where its so difficult to be able to send a freaking photo. I don't want to send photos that I have received via WhatsApp I want to send ones from my phone. Its difficult to then find that option and when you do.. why can't I send a video?
"This update is totally not it especially the fact that message can no longer pop up at the top of one's screen. So annoying, I have to keep opening the App just to see if I have an important message. 😡"
"After the latest update problem in logging in...then after I had uninstalled it and again installed..the application was crash or hang and now it is showing that your number is ban after new update. And my telegram also having the same problem after new update of what's app version every time I have to restart my phone and show that your number is ban after latest update. So people i request you to uninstall this application,this is completely fraud and your data may get lick."
You have destroyed the picture messaging functionality of whatsapp. I am not alone. Who the hell decided that it was a good idea to have to go into gallery and then send 1 picture at a time. Foolish. I will go somewhere else if this isn't sorted. Stupid beyond belief.
"Multiple bugs.. difficulty in sending audio message. Also on scrolling up, the chat moves to a month prior chat. Too much of slow down and hanging issues being faced with latest updates"
"Great app, works well. I just don't like the fact that ANY number, even if it's not saved on your phone can contact you. It's actually quite dangerous. Especially when minors are on this app."
I installed a new whatsapp but I cannot access the app. An error report says the app has a bug and will not open. I've tried everything to fix the issue with no results. What's the issue here?!
"Can anyone fix this bug on s22 ultra? I try to send pictures and videos and it only shows ""recent"" ones? Like screenshots, videos or pictures from camera roll don't exist!! Just the one received on WhatsApp! It is annoying as everytime I need to go in my camera roll and share from there... What is this update? Since meta has this app stuff changed for the worst! I'll change my rating once this issue is sorted."
"If you are the maker or you can fix this problem, than do not ignore this comment. I experience when i create the Broadcast list of around 75 members, so, the message was not sent to all members but some of them not received..... Please fix that problem...as soon as possible."
I love all the features you guys added in WhatsApp gradually. Nd most new feature avatar. I just love it. I want this feature since u added it in Instagram & Facebook so really very appreciative.& Their is little amaze thing is tht i can massage my self but i was like how can i massage me on it. its Really strange for me. After all this things i love to use whatsapp.😘😇
"Can you guys fix the upload quality for stories. Every time I post a good quality photo it just looks bad to a point I don't want to look at it, fix this problem, stop reducing the quality period. That goes for videos as well."
"Just fix the position or timing of opening microphone. When I listen to music and send message, send button somehow lags and makes like I've pressed record button. And it stops music for a second or two. Please fix this"
As of this morning whatsapp has stopped working. Not sure what the issue is but cant send or receive messages or attachments. And can't download the app on any phone either.. Please resolve this if possible.. My Internet service provider has informed me that the issue is not at their end.
"The Beauty of WhatsApp is it's simplicity. Don't add unwanted features trying to make it the second facebook or second Instagram, just let it be WhatsApp. Simple, private, secure, messaging app nothing more. Need more features? Like community and organization of different groups on a very large scale? Use whatsapp business. Keep it simple aye? If it's not broken don't try fixing it."
It's a good app and the developer has actually attempted to upgrade it. One request though...if the developer can include the option of separating chats from groups and also maybe the one for being able to ghost view and save statuses as in the duplicate Whatsapp versions would be a total game changer
"According to my experience this app is very Helpful for us... watsap app is very safe and really most important and interesting app for all those person's who have a samrt phones...In my Point of view it's really enjoyable app.....also Very helpful app for us.....For example... Sometimes we have a urgent work with our friends, relative's,Even those person's those who don't know...or unkown person's for us ...then in our mobile doesn't balence and then we can use watsp to contact those person's.."
After the last update. The app is working very bad. The other person is unable to hear & voice is getting cut all the time & it's automatically getting disconnected . Pls solve this issue. Thank you.
There's this weird bug that changes my account's date (for example: 14th of April 1987) and it can only be fixed by reinstalling the app. And it just came back after barely a week.
"Hi! This app is very simplify life , it's very amazing, but , I am asking for deleting old messages or media from my conversation and the other conversation , because sometimes we regret about messages that we send and we need to delete it . So , please if you can add this feature 🙏, Thank you . 😊"
"Still Now It Is Problematic, While uploading video greater than 30 seconds on status, second part does not continue exactly from where first part ends, even I have started second part or status from 30 and 31 second of the video. pelase add option for trimming the video automatically"
"Dear developers! The app is good, but the new updates are a bit disappointing. I'll get to the point, please! Make it possible to log in to your account from another phone! I don't know what to do! So that there are no problems, they say that the akkaun is already busy, this is such a problem and the loss of time."
"This is the best platform I hve ever used, its so convenient, the video and audio calls are superb its just like u speaking to a persn in the next room, its so crystal clear, there is no delay in voice and video interacting like wht others do. Keep it up good work!"
Since the recent update I'm having trouble with the app. I get new messages but don't recieve any sound notification that I got a new message. Please fix this with the app. I have a Samsung Note 9 and it started about 3 days ago that I don't get any notification sound when I recieve new messages. About to permanently uninstall the app.
"Currently it's not reading the phone media when you try to send pictures. There's a backwards way of sharing it through your media app, but seriously."
"Whenever someone sees the photo or video send by us in WhatsApp,we get the blue ticks.but we can't tell if the other person has downloaded and watched our photos and videos of not.also we can't see if they have played our voice message or not or clicked on the links we send them.I hope that WhatsApp will bring these features in the upcoming updates."
"I love everything about the new WhatsApp update except for the fact that the search option under chats takes a very long time to respond.Everytime I try to search a friend's name it takes like forever to respond, sometimes I have to go back to my contact and search for the person and click ""message on WhatsApp"" before I can recah them please fix it"
This new poll feature is not up to the mark because the voters are able to choose all the options in the poll but will be good when only 1 option can be chosen.....except if the questioner need a multiple opption answer.so i request watsapp devolopers to make some modification in this feature...or else i personally think it will not be much usefull......
Pictures aren't available to upload easily anymore. Need to tap multiple files to get to the gallery page. New photos don't appear as an option to send.
I love using this app. Easy to use. I use this app for works. But it is quite annoying bcs i have to log out every time i get out of my desk at my office so that nobody can accidentally read my text on the screen. So each time i do this i have to wait a quite sometime for all of my massages to redownload and resyncing with my phone once i login.So I really hope that what's app could improve the What'sApp Web which to include password protection for web features so i don't have to log out again.
"I have been using this application for 5 years since graduating from elementary school until now. There are so many features that I like so far, but sometimes I find it very difficult to delete my chat history without opening a chat room. because sometimes there are nosy people who give me the form of virus text. I have to delete it without being connected to the internet on my smartphone but it can't because I must to enter the chat room first then I can delete it. Please Meta, thanks"
"Even though it's a nice app for communication, and I really like that I can call anyone as long as I have their phone number. It's pretty annoying that it uses more than 2gb of my phone, additionally it uses only the internal memory card and I can't move it to SD card. Since my phone itself only has 16gb of internal memory (since automatically 10gb is filled by the system I only get 6gb left). Isn't there any way to decrease it's storage usage on the phone or moving to SD card?"
WhatsApp on pixel 6 with Android 13 no longer respects device notification settings. Calls ring loud even if the phone is in silent mode or vibrate mode. Calls can't be quieted by volume button or anything else. Either answer the call or decline. This is horrible to deal with.
"There could be a feature such that we can delete the offline files of our chats, but they are not deleted in cloud. Therefore when we want, we can see them (like in Google Photos). If our chats can stay end-to-end encrypted in Google Drive now, I think this feature also could be possible. In such a way we wouldn't download all our chats (full backup) to see just one message which is in the cloud."
"I am facing a really big problem with this app.When I am logging my account,it is not giving any OTP and when touched resend,it is showing that I have guessed too many times even my account got log out itself without my permission.It is also showing that I have done spam but I even didn't use my account any purpose other than school work. When I am requesting to see WHAT I HAVE DONE? By mailing ,the team is not answering.It has been 3 days but I problem is not solved till now .plz solve my prblm"
Can't attach media (camera) after Android update. So dissapointed and had to open in gallery to attach it. Too much affort just for a simple task. Also not appear in recent media. Fix this!
Why have you changed the way we send photos/video from our galleries??? Now it only shows recents (things that have been taken within whatsapp) if i want to send a pic or video i need to come out of whatsapp go2 my gallery & THEN send... so annoying!! Used 2b simple attach from gallery WITHIN whatsapp. Change this stupid update it isnt only me complaining of this issue!
"I can't even validate my account! It's so annoying! I will NEVER recommend this app! I emailed support and I haven't even gotten a response! It has been FIVE days since I emailed support and I still haven't gotten a response even though stated in their automatic response, it takes up to TWO business day... I'm STILL WAITING! SMH! If you can't resolve an issue with YOUR app just say!"
"I had a very good experience of using this application, and it's so useful for the person to have a conversation with the person who is far from us. Just one suggestion you must add up the music in the story uploading so the people who wants to add music with photo or a video can be possible easily. Must do this change and update it soon, people will so happy to use it. Thank you"
It's really a good app the new features are awesome but it shouldn't have the feature of seen or unseen status updates and online status of contacts I wish there should be a way to turn off what's app even i am connected to internet and the feature of anti delete messages
"The latest update not good at all. The individual screen is cropped while on call. If you exit from the app, the video drops from top to bottom. Really pathetic now."
"Pls fix the bug where camera roll and screenshot from device's gallery cannot be found within whatsapp gallery. All i get from contacting y'all through customer support are automated copy paste reply and non-relevant reply. Edit: I contacted whatsapp through the app itself and they replied but all i got was a non-relevant reply, and they eventually closed the chat on me. If you're not even gonna try to help your users, don't even bother creating an app and a customer support."
"What's wrong with whatsapp? Like other reviewers said, now I have to go through multiple steps to select photos from phone album to send via whatsapp and even though only one photo per send can be attached, when previously I could select up to 30. Fix this!"
My dp automatically keeps removing. I even update it everytime there is chance to update. On one hand WhatsApp assures safety and encryption and on the other hand they remove display picture without consent. Worst experience with this version of WhatsApp. Highly disappointed ☹️
You guys need to work on your backup and restore option and the speed it offers no matter how speed your network connection is and also why can't you guys just give options to backup every aspect based on users usage like some people want to backup just chat while no media while some want to backup both while some have other requirements
New update change for attaching photos is TERRIBLE! GO BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS! Within the app can only attach 1 photo at a time and photos aren't easy accessible. Please change it back...whole reason I use this app is for photo video sharing!!
"Touching a profile picture from chat screen automatically opens their status. That's the worst update till now. Please fix it. Sometimes we wanna see their profile picture, not their statuses. If we wanna see their status, we will go into ""status"" and see their statuses. Please fix it ASAP."
This latest round of updates is deplorable. Having to dig into the menu and then gallery just to attach an image / vid and this floating call button no one asked for. This is how messenger apps go to die.
"App was woeking untill the recent update but now we didnt like the option last seen and online option its too stressing , then It is difficult to know when someone is block or not ,kindly add the feature if someone blocks it shows on window screen , that is particular person blocks you .Kindly take a necessaey steps to remove last seen option"
"Trying to restore from backup since last 15 hours by using mobile data as well as high speed Wi-Fi but not happening. Now it is totally hanged. Requesting to resolve this difficulty, otherwise there is no ultimate utility of backup process."
"Since the update, I cannot access my gallery to attach videos and pics. Before this, I always used Whatsapp to send videos because they came through clear and unpixelated. Now, I can only send pics and videos as document attachments."
I just found out I've been banned from using WhatsApp Messenger. Are you guys real? The app was downloaded from Play Store so what's YOUR problem? I've been forced to use the business app because the regular app is not working on my device. The app is experiencing difficulties and the suggestion is that I uninstall and reinstall the app. THAT DOESN'T WORK! I've done this a dozen times or more. Fix the issues so I can go back to using the regular app
"I've used whatsapp to share photos and videos without the downgrade of quality. Now, what ever media you send via whatsapp, they're all horrible quality. I also can't save files to my gallery anymore."
"This app doesn't mute conversations anymore. You press mute notifications button and all it does is not tell me who's messaging me, I still gey a notification saying I have a message and the vibration/noise. Seriously annoying when you get 100s of group chat notifications a day!"
"Just love this App. It's original, easy to use, private, and not full of frustrating ads or gimmicks that attempt to make you buy things you don't want or need! Simply great 😁"
"Hi WhatsApp, with the new update which supports 'undo' after deleting media from the chats. I am getting weird experience to use it. My medias are not at all deleting. Can you please look into this and solve this in the coming release?"
Pop up notifications no longer work in the most recent Android version and there is no way to turn them on which renders the app fairly useless if I have to keep opening it up to see if I have messages. Please sort this out WhatsApp.
"What need to add community feature every person unhappy from this feature it became useless this app. What was the need to add online status show or hide feature. Please remove online status hidden option. Simple WhatsApp was much better than this version. The option ""create call link"" should be removed from this version. When we are listening to the voice message in the background and it remains on the top after it ends, it should be automatically removed from the top after listening. Old V😒"
I haven't had any issues. Guess maybe people don't like the new Group settings. Why use this End to end encrypted app to talk to a group???? Please! Just go to Google chat! I hate Google Chat. This has way more functionality for real private one on one communication and better understanding.
"After latest update dring video calls whenever the person mutes the audio, ""ABC muted this call"" will be displayed on the center of a screen which is annoying/irritating. If it was on any corner would be good."
"Have problem when call, and often disconnect, on and off. Make it very difficult to have conversations. thanks whatsapp, for creating this app. Families & friends can connected. Sincerely. Happy Christmas & new year."
"Im still waiting for an update where people wont see the ""this message has been deleted"". Like? I want to delete it because i dont want them to read the message but oh thanks, now they know that I've deleted a messages. That is so annoying. If instagram and telegram can do it, why cant whatsapp? Geez."
I have a bad situation for about last week. the time is not accurate at all. Its changing every day to 19th and for example 50 years later. I updated this app. Turned off and on auto time and date for several times. Setting the 24hour format. But its not going to be right. Really suffering!!!! Xiaomi redme not 11 pro plus
The fact that every update comes with something special is 💯 dope. But why can't we still edit our messages? People make a lot of mistakes that they would like to correct but there is no room for editing. Do something about it. It's very important!
"The app is horrible and complete trash. On the phone it works just okay but when I want to use whatsapp web, I do the steps they ask and they are easy but I have to do that everyday. Currently my phone wasn't working so my last option was whatsapp web to contact the outside world but the stupid app asks me evey single day to scan the code!!! Bro my phone aint working so just do your job and remember me!"
"One of the worst chat app you can get. It uses your phone number as an ID so it allows everyone to see your number so ofc you will need to take extra steps to create a fake number just to use this app. Also , it has no translation tools what so ever!! And the chat is a split screen .. doesn't give u an option to go full screen. I messaged support a it this and they told me to reset my phone lol. I removed this app and moved my groups to line app. If I can give this app 0 stars , I would."
"There is some kind of bug evertime i face a problem. I m not able to see video status then i have to restart it and error is showing "" there was in error playing the video"" and this problem i . facing from last 6 month i updated this app so many time but still is is not resolving what are you doing man, this such a pathatic job. 😡"
"So useless! Keeps saying unable to connect, I have tried everything even went to google for answers, but not even that works. And even when it goes in, my messages tske forever to send and receive! !! Please fix whatever it is"
"Hi! Current version of Whatsapp has one functionality issue, once we click on friend's dp, unless to open it to big screen, it goes to status that's very bad behavior, please remove it and shift back to previous function."
"On my phone WhatsApp Notification bar for massages does not show. When I open WhatsApp, then I get the massage otherwise I can't understand as no number notification doesn't show. When I open the application , at that time if any massage come but don't read or hear that ,then the number notification can be seen . I have tried but this problem is not solved ! Many days ago such error had occurred in W-app , but it was gone later with new update . My other apps notification come . Solve it soon!"
"After install the app after sometine there is issue in the opening of the chat, if I wants to open a chat to see the message whatsApp automatically stoped and show my home screen, I request to you that please do something for it. I hope this problem will resolved soon."
"It always failed to backup, I need to manually clear cache, Then backup again. And the backup took me about 2 hour or more to complete for 500mb, sometime stucked at 99% for more than 1 hour. Very terrible backup experience."
"App s going worst day by day. During video calls including group calls, bluetooth on/off doesn't make any change. Voice come only through bluetooth device. New layout in video call split in two parts not comfortable, faces cut in view."
When there is a update in the dp it's immediately reflected when opened the app. But in the notifications the old dp is displayed still. Nothing disturbing functionally... Yet still a ui issue. Hope u fix this .....
"It's good but would be great if you have a unread msg tab which can show the unread messages only. Due to busy schedule, if I don't check for some time, it gets cluttered with many messages and i have to swipe sequentially to reach till unread messages."
"I tried to send pictures in whatsapp.then I select gallery from tools bar,but that gallery now showing the camera and screenshot images.after that i clicked right side corner three dots that's shows gallery and photos even that's shows camera folder and every folders but I can't select multiple pictures.i don't know why and I don't know how to solve this problem...!!!!"
"Why whatsapp is not working like before.... After i view a status and goed back to the home that sound still remain like in the back ground. What bug is this? And the second one, while i view statuses it goes black and only supporta audio remaining screen black... It occurs sometimes. Please fix it"
"Whatsapp update been doing good so far, like really good and i mean it. But one small issue. Make an update that can simply edit a status. For example, we can edit a video/image status with caption in it. Such as misspelling and so on. So we wont get embrass by others contact that seen our status lol xD. Hope yall read this"
"While playing voice notes/audio in a chat, the audio plays in the earpiece when the phone screen is touched or taken near the ear. But in my case it is automatically playing in the earpiece, turning the screen black and if I try to unlock the screen to stop it from playing the audio/reduce the volume, then the App is getting hanged! Please look into this."
This app has really turned to something else after my last update... My keyboard suddenly changed.. I feel bad because it will take me time to start mastering my keyboard again... I have checked my phone settings and everything is inorder and this particular issue is only displaying in my WhatsApp keyboard... Please I really need a feedback
"Why only a 3 star rating, when it is one of the dominant messaging apps? Because it isn't secure, irrespective of the end to end encryption it claims to employ. It is great that only admins can see certain changes, but admins should decide if a group needs disappearing messages or not. Indeed, it should not be possible for a hacker to take over another person's account !! I have received messages from people who didn't send them, many times...this is an identity issue and needs to be fixed ASAP"
"It cannot keep in touch with friends, when you use as another handset. When you open the account in that specific phone, need to go back to that handphone set."
"Since the last update, I can't select photos or videos for sending as before. Including the fact that I can't send multiple at the same time. What happened to make this so complicated?"
"I like the new features but idk why I can't view half of my contacts's status. It's gone. Like there's no one updating their status today. But when I ask them whether they hide their status on me or not, they deny it and yes they didn't hide it from me. This keep happening. The first time it happened, I decided to re-install the app and it gets back to normal. But this week it happens again. Pls fix this bug or whatever it called."
"Please can you fix the photo sending? It is very time-consuming, having to send 1 picture at a time. Also, gallery is no longer attached to WhatsApp. Please, can we go back to the previous settings"
To be frank I don't like the new version. Even after deleting messages the chats are remaining on top that is a serious privacy issue. This needs to fixed.. After deleting certain messages the chat needs to go down by date but it's not happening
"Annoying update... newly screenshotted images or screenecorded videos don't appear ""recently added"" section of the status updates. And I can't send images to friends from gallery either!!!! WhatsApp fix this please!!!!!"
"hey WhatsApp, we've seen such a major increase in updates in the last year, one of them which was totally okay until I used it was the poll's update. it's good and all but I think adding a setting where you can chooce that every participant vote for only one option or allocating one vote/p would really make huge impact on the concept of the entire thing. it might even change the livelihoods of children starving in Africa and bring and end to Ebola. please consider this and add a beam of light!!"
"Hi, I have updated my version of Whats App.. yet the photos and videos I send to my family via Whats App are of poor quality! They get blurred photos and videos. But in my photo album the same photos and videos are very clear. What must I do to fix this? Please help! Thank you."
"overall, its actually a good app for communication and calls since that i've been use it for years but sadly now i can't screenshot or screen record the one view images/videos that i use to show them to my friends :) i hope that i can screenshot or screen record them back cause i miss it :)"
"Is a good app for me and my bf, but drops video calls after 13hrs, eats my battery like nothing so have to keep my phone on charge and heats up my phone almost too hot to touch. Please fix these issues and I'll rate higher. Can't change contracts name either!"
I am having a very horrific experience with this after this much time of using it. In my app the chats are not sorted according to their timings for example the chats of 10th November are seen before the chats of 11th November. I tried to contact WhatsApp support but their solution is also unable to fix the problem. I think its a bug So please do the needful.
"Can someone fix the app for ipads!! There is no option to review it from my ipad so I will review it here. On my Android phone, Windows Laptop, it is great 5 out of 5, but on my ipad mini it is horrible 1 out of 5. I cannot make any calls, it takes forever to synch. It's just useless. PLEASE FIX IT. I don't know whether it needs to be fixed from the Whatsapp side or the Apple side but IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED!!!"
"Why do you have to give acess to camera 100% of the time, the ask everytime option only works once, then they stop asking. This is a violation of privacy. These companies want complete access to the cell phone, or the app doe not función. This is a scary. Use with caution"
The video of the callers in group video call in the new update is not complete. Earlier one was better. Now only half video is visible. The full face is not visible. Pls rectify the same immediately.
"Thank you for the opportunity. I would suggest that you reapply the forwarding of messages to broadcast list ..That was really helpful for some of us. And also, apply to the app that other apps can not view our deleted items."
"This app is good. But now i don't know what happened. Firstly, my WhatsApp was not able to send or receive messages and make calls. Then i reinstalled it. And now I'm trying to login my id after reinstallation, it asks to wait for 5 mins as whatsapp is not available. After 5 mins if i try it says the same thing again!! I seriously hate this glitch. Please help recovering this problem"
It is the best way of communication. This is so good and easy to use . hoping that this app can update for more security features .but it is so cool and add the features like we can even watch the msgs that deleted by the senders
"Dear sir this phone number is completely mine. The truth is that for some convenience in the status, i.e. when viewing the status, only if we want to show our name in the view list, I tried every time for convenience, from whatsapp to yo whatsapp app, that is also the same system but the facility that I said was there 😔😔😔 that's why it became such a mess. So I humbly request you to provide this facility in next update. I humbly request you to return my account as well🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏"
"Useless. I got a new phone and sent for the verification code, nothing came through. Followed all the online advice, made sure my phone was working fine, still nothing, uninstalled and reinstalled, still nothing. 5 days of this went by. Tried to get in contact with WhatsApp support who emailed me 3 automated messages and then closed my ticket after telling me my question had already been answered."
AWFUL BACK UP SYSTEM!!! I use this whatsapp for 3 years straight then it started glitching and lagging alot so i uploaded a local back up save then uninstalled and reinstalled only to find out there was no back up file detected. All of my 3 years chats are important to me wether personal or business wise all gone..the back up is trash...switching to telegram
"Hello i have a problem where my WhatsApp can not open any picture that set to be seen once. My WhatsApp is up to date for the latest version. Please help, because my work consists many picture to be taken and I don't want to compromise my internal storage."
"They have to stop reducing images and video qualities for me. It's my data network usage, it's my business. They reduce my images and videos into a very low quality and it annoys me."
"After the recent WhatsApp update, multiple stared ⭐ messages couldn't be deleted in one go. When several *Stared* messages from multiple senders are deleted simultaneously, only one message is got deleted and rest of the messages still exists in relevant chats. Most probably this bug is due to the introduction of new feature regarding undoing of deleted message(s). The system bug should be fixed on priority."
"It was all great before the last update. Now I can't easily send photos from my gallery anymore, it became super complicated and inconvenient. Please fix this."
"The app sucks a lot 🤞I downloaded the app so many times and deleted it so many times but I couldn't use it..bcoz I wasn't sent the verification code ..I tried everything I could but still, i never got any verification code ....besides that , the app is good...but please send me the code , I cannot wait 17 hours coz it's an emergency"
"Beyond Aggravated Due to the Meta drop I have had to uninstall and reinstall this app. I had my app to backup once a month because for some reason I had blind faith in your app. I have now lost everything since the 7th till today. Photos of my son that I can't get back, amongst other things. And now I have to set up this stupid thing to run a daily backup because you haven't got your ducks in a row."
I want to see one intersting feature that is 'Near to me'. This will make the journey thrilling. We will be more excited if we found our near dears with the help of WhatsApp 'Near to me' feature. Where we will see the people distance from the current location. And of course this will opt user that he wants or not to enable his location. Thankyou!!
Can't send pictures normally. Have to open phone gallery and then share it from there. Can not simply click the media option on the app and send pictures through there. Very annoying now.
"Such a frustrating user experience. Everything from messaging a new contact to using a tablet are cumbersome and unreliable. Hasn't improved in any meaningful way, and now under Facebook (meta)'s ownership, whatsapp violates my privacy by tracking to monetize my data me in and out of this app without any ability for me to stop them. If I could rate with negative stars I woul."
"I have very bad experience while using video call , after few minutes of video call rear camera which is selfish view gets stuck , but opposite person can see my clearly and after that it's not possible to drop the call nor could use any options in WhatsApp and later automatically app gets close"
"Since latest update to Android 13 (Samsung S22) I am unable to send photos from my folders which I saved (camera photos, screenshots or downloaded images), only those which were received via WhatsApp. I can no longer copy an image from online and paste it into a chat to send."
"Thank you WhatsApp for making an easy and convenient app so that I can connect with my family members daily. All features are good and work excellently, but can you please make the call feature available on WhatsApp Web also? It'll be very helpful for me, especially because my phone isn't always online and I use WhatsApp Web more often than this app. But overall, this app is very wonderful! 😀"
"i don't want to see the updates my contact has a status shared. I constantly mute most of them in order to cut off distraction, now you put a circle around the contacts picture! Please give an option to stop seeing that circled profiles."
Forces you to give permissions you don't need and don't have a reason or want for just do you can recieve your weekly roster at work that you only need to see for a second. Good one. Hate having to have such an invasive app. I really did NOT want to give you that permission but you blocked me from even opening that 1 message until I did.
"After choosing weekly backup the app keeps attempting to backup daily then hangs. Uninstalled/Reinstalled the app & same. When an app works fine to have your developers mess around with it, is just plain stupidity."
Good app but please allow bigger files to be sent and also allow a feature that allows the app to automatically select 30second intervals or skip 30second intervals on a video when posting a status to work along side the ability to manually space the duration of the video which should accommodate in chat videos as well when sending a big video clip longer than 12minutes
"Its been good recently i especially like the polls but u should add options for the poll like if ppl could have on or multiple answers add images, make it anonymous like only u could see who picked what or not even ypu could see etc, i also wish we could specific ppl on voice calls, it was supposed to be implemented but it hasnt, also i think if u could make a system where you can share someones status is cool, goddamn update the laptop version for group calls and polls for statuses"
"Since a month ago, it turned into a time traveling machine! For example it says I am in 2041 and the one who I am sending message to, is in 1993! So when people send me messages, I have to scroll down the chat list to find their chat! And I can't see statuses because they were sent in 1993 so they are expired in 2041! Everything is messed up and I cannot even explain it! What the hell are you doing?!"
"After latest update, can't send more than 1 photo in 1 time. Can't send any video. This is ridiculous. If WhatsApp still going this way, Im thinking to switch to other apps."
"Overall its good. But when clicking on DP, and clicking again on picture, it is redirecting to their status page if they have any active status. Or else it is displaying their dp only."
"Hi developer, for WhatsApp web, require to fix, during searching in any group at search tab, results appeared. But after select 1 of the results, the search tab closed back. User have to retype again, to click on other result messages. Please fix this issue. Ease for searching history messages."
"It was great until I lost all my chats.. The app crashed 5 times in 4 months, each time it was struggling to restore backups and it would show no chat history. The last 3 times I somehow managed to restore it by, ironically, skipping the restore option.. I would lose a few days/weeks of messages. This time I've been trying for 2 weeks in different ways, following tips from others users experiencing the same issues, but it's not restoring the chats. I'm very disappointed and frustrated. Any tips?"
"All of the sudden ,its hang up my freaking call without me doing it .Always connecting while in call but I can clearly play games .please fix this asap. edit : everytime when im playing games while on call its suddenly disconnected on its own . please fix this as well . been going like this for months. edit : 27/12/2022 still the same problem"
"Have been using this for a very long time, very good no problem.. but recently I can't send any text nor pic to my friend!! What the h*ll?? I check my system update, app update even my WiFi connection there's nothing wrong with 'em.. please fix this bugs so frustrating!!!!!"
Image attachment became very troublesome after it is not able to detect latest images. Can't send multiple photos either. Huge problem and super inconvenient!
WhatsApp is a good massaging app . The best in the word in my experience but I got one idea for the producer. I deleted multiple states just because the caption is wrong so it would be time saving if you guys add an edit to it in the future updates thankyou . From an angry user .
"I dont know what happened bith whats app doesn't work at all. I have done all what i could and still not work. They saying i have no network. Crapp i have two phone both different network and both whats apps not working, wifi is very strange so its not broadband issue or network"
The last Samsung update has made the picture albums unavailable and you can now only send one photo at a time unless you go through the gallery and select share! Needs to go back to the way it was previously!
"Even though the app offers good features, forcing the users to update to the newest version against their will and otherwise denying them access to their messages and whole interface is a no-go for me, especially if the update is still unstable or has some reported bugs."
"My notifications have started delivering as silent, went through all my settings and nothing is incorrect, contacting whatsapp support is like talking to a brick wall, nost useless support system on Earth, other than that the app us mediocre and I genuinely wish everyone would move away from it and use something else."
"Great app, I love it. Would it be possible to add a feature where we can pin texts?? Especially in group chats. That would make my life (as a student) soo much better. I'd really appreciate it 😊😊 Edit - I still stand by my 5 star rating, however, whenever I and others(I've asked around) want to send gifs, the gif panel doesn't go all the way up like it used to. It starts at the bottom of the screen making it difficult to search for the perfect gif. Kindly fix it. TIA 😊😊"
"What'sapp is wonderful to use, Hello dear reader I'm not able to use the permission only this time consistently, for all of the optioms like microphone, camera, location and extraWhy that is happening is that a by design behaviour or is it something to related to limited the usage of only this time functionality.After usage of one time the only this time the notification throws up to enable the always use permission. Is that expected or do I need to configure something. ThankPrem"
Everything is awesome. One problem is there is no option to backup only the msgs without the photos(media). This leads us to have the backup of more size. Kindly provide a option to backup only chat messages.
"Kindly,. 1. Introduce a ""Delete for All"" that Deletes messages completely, those on WhatsappGB are still accessing deleted messages. 2. Also, a DELETED STATUS must Disappear immediately and be unavailable to all viewers. Kindly work on that"
"They deleted 30 GB on my data over 3 years when transferring my chats. I downloaded an exported all my chats would it take an hours of work to do just in case and it wouldn't let me import it once I downloaded WhatsApp on my new phone. On top of that, I purchased a software that is supposed to easily migrate the data to the new phone, which it did. But afterwards what's up forced me to download a new version of the app which deleted all of my chats except for 100 MB out of 30 gb."
"What is wrong with the app? I love it because it works even if the internet speed is slow, and now it won't send the messages even if the seep is fast. It sucks. It deleted and tried reinstalling it, but it won't work whatsoever"
"There's a problem in whatsApp, msgs aren't showing any ticks ( like single when a msg is sent or double tick when a msg is received)... Internet connection is totally fine, I can see the status if the people, I can download images or PDFs, but msgs aren't showing ticks..."
"It is extremely annoying for business accounts to keep reaching out without permission. As if SMS wasn't enough, now this is infested with commercial messages as well. Make a feature to opt out of getting any business messages please."
"Often miss calls as it doesnt ring when device is locked, yes iv setup ringtones, turned off all battery options on the S5e tablet, it just tells me i missed a call right after person calls, so messages clearly work fine and give sound too, so only thing left is app issue!"
"It fine on most points, there are some annoying/confusing bits, but those aren't really issues necessarily. Though i do hate how it destroys picture and video quality, it reduces the amount of pixels greatly."
"As the previous reviewer, Robin Deacon stated, the last few days photos I've taken don't show in the folder when attempting to attach and send a picture. Requires a manual work around which is time-consuming and annoying. Please fix this problem WhatsApp!"
WhatsApp is doing pretty well but should consider including the feature that will allow and auto split videos longer than 30 seconds during status update and allow the user to select which part of the video he wants to upload
"Status video trimming is not accurate. It keeps on trimming statuses inaccurately after the latest Android update. Why!!! It's do frustrating, fix it!!!!"
"After updating the app i can't send video to my friend it keep saying "" failed to proccess video, please try again later. If u keep seeing this message, please restart you device "" Though restarting doesn't help since yhe problem still exist"
"The reason I achieve certain texts is so that I can't see them. Apparently you guys put the achieved conversations on top where I'm constantly tempted to check the achieved messages. Why not put the ""achieved"" button at the bottom? Change this and 5 starts are all yours, baby!"
"Wow really good. Only one tiny thing that I don't like. . . The phone number. The idea that i have is instead of adding people by phone number, a 4 digit code. It would be alot more easier. But no bugs so this is the best messenger app! You're a genius!"
"Hello Team, I would like to inform you that I am not able to send and receive messages from any user since 30 minutes ago. I don't know what is happening with me is this a global issue or only with me. Please look into this matter and improve it on priority or give some applications update or playstore. Thankyou."
"I have sent money to a person on chat through ""send money to UPI ID"" option. But there is not showing any transaction history like WhatsApp pay. It's more satisfying when WhatsApp add a feature to showing a message like ""the person send you XXXX money to your account using UPI ID"" and like a message on our chat also . Thank you."
"Great app, great experience. Please I noticed something about the latest update, that if you delete a particular thing in the chat, that chat remains at the top of your chat list even if the last chat after the deleted one is days before. Please kindly fix the error. Thank you"
"Great app for audio and video call. But I would recommend to add some features like, It would be great if there have a option that is ""marks As unread or read"" So That we can easily find out our new Massage and help to Ignore the Spam messages"
"Since last update. I am not able to send any media, it says I should restart my phone. I've done it and still not working. I even deleted and re install the app but still not able to send media."
"you just picked the right choice update 1Nov22 been a pleasent use, until whatsapp keeps on updating new features that r somehow unnecessary! I wish to degrade the new update to get rid of this status preview from the profile pic, if not then there should be a button to deactivate the status section. The only thing i can do mute. Its becoming more like Instagram.. will delete if further ""instagram-like"" features keep on being added in in the future.."
"Popup notifications unavailable on new android 13 for my phone. Can't change it from WhatsApp settings, it's locked to unavailable. Phone is Samsung f62. Basically wanted to keep the popups coming even through my phone was on silent. Can't do that without keeping sound profile."
"Pathetic customer support!! I can't use my old account. Error message says ""it's banned"". I tried 3 different ways to describe this problem to customer support with screenshots and everything. Everytime they send same massage saying everything is ok, there's no problem. Then why I'm unable to use my old account?!"
"You guys keep telling me I'm spamming and blocking me account, I have to verify myself everyday, it's annoying and frustrating. How can I get in contact with someone so this can be resolved. I have texted WhatsApp Support and they have done nothing to help."
I ve 2 numbers on the phone. I scarcely send or receive msgs on wars app as i am not very active in msging etc-only few necessary ones. But my watts app got blocked stating too many msgs are being sent-which is wrong. I started Watts app on same phone with another number but the same thing happened. Again watts app got blocked stating that too many msgs are being sent. Although we r not sending any msg. I have reset my phone. But still Watts app on both numbers is blocked. COULD YOU HELP.
"This is really unbearable now. If you guys don't want me to use your app again, just tell me straight up. Cos I don't understand this anymore. You keep blocking me and claim it's due to Spam, which I don't know when I ever sent. What's worse is even that anytime I send a review, it'll take almost a whole day, 24hours to be restored, and then, right after some time you log me out again. This has gone on for the past two weeks. Why???"
"Constant issues. It doesn't show me any usable photo albums besides ""camera"" or ... ""WhatsApp"" so I basically can't send a screenshot or a saved photo which deems some chats useless..."
"The app is great. My problem is it does not have a LOGOUT option, it only has a DELETE account option. Sometimes one will want to logout and take a breather but you will be forced to delete the app instead. PLEASE put a LOGOUT option in your next update. Thank you"
"A feature to hide a chat, or to hide the archived chats bar above the list would be good, i guess? Also, after clearing notifications from the notification panel, when a new message is received, the previous notifs done come on the notif panel again. What's the issue? And what's the solution, please?"
"Been having issues with sending pictures, normally when clicking the camera it shows the most recent pictures taken/screenshots. Now it just shows me most recent images I received on WhatsApp Opening gallery doesn't show recent camera pics either shows a random mishmash of pictures from ages ago and organises the albums by WhatsApp chat instead of my actual gallery albums"
"Very useless service, I am waiting for the verification code since four days, till now I have not received the verification code, all my work is pending.I have also sent 10 mails but there was no response to the mails as well on youtube whatsapp, tried all the solutions mentioned, still nothing is happening kindly my problem as soon as possible. Its a request"
"After the most recent update, every time the app is not visibly open on my phone, notifications would not come in until I open the app and everything shows up, I've checked background data settings on my phone and everything is intact, this has happened to me twice and always after an update. I really hope this could be fixed immediately. It's very disturbing."
Why am i not able to log in with my phone number? This is so frustrating. I installed the app but now i can't link in? I have to scan it with my other device? What an absurd idea. Fix it the way it was before. The way we could link in with our phone numbers and a opt.
"Every time I open what's app page on play store I have multiple problems, now I can't back up my chats, the back stop on 78% every time start, I try it all night and can't back up anything, fix ur stupid app please, what's app is everywhere and still it's so full of problems, hire some people to fix this app before it become complate useless"
"all fine... need some updates as well, like 1. we're unable to know, whether we did 'deleted for everyone' or 'delete for myself', it'd be better after deleting the message should read, 'You deleted this message for everyone' and '.... yourself'.... also we need to have a switch option for changing from both delete for everyone to myself and vice versa as well. 2. increase head count of groups 3. in community option, once created or deleting giving notification for all people is redundant"
"I have a problem while using the WhatsApp call, the speaker is not really good, there's no sound at all. My phone's speaker is doing well, but when I have to use WhatsApp for calling, it's doesn't work properly."
So... It's really interesting and i do find out good things inside especially with calls messages and so on ... Yeah ! I do really like it 😊! And now on with the new version updated with the group call! It became really good 🤩 that's amazing. ..
Suggestion: As of now status video length can be 30 seconds and if user want to keep longer length video on status then it needs to crop video for 30 sec again and again. So Whatsapp should add feature like once user choses longer length video it should allow to select from and to more than 30 seconds and automatically there should be split into 30 second chunks. May be the case like same feature is available but I am not aware of it. Sorry if already present. 1star for attention only else 5star
"Whatsapp desktop version 2.2245.5.0 for windows 11: The image editing menu does not contain the feature to crop an image. It was present in older desktop versions, but now this essential feature is missing. Please bring back image cropping!!!"
Too much privacy! We don't know our couple still on the call or video call with somone else or not. Please put in the notification while the person who we call still on another call with someone else. Caused now the notification was gone and we don't know the real status
"Recent update is Awful!! Can't send multiple pictures, cant send videos, cant send pucture from paperclip attachment. It's like trying to crack the da vinci code when I just wanna send a bleeding picture. Sort it whatsapp it's a jokeeeee"
"This app is becoming crazier everyday!! Firstly, when I have multiple inboxes or unread messages and I try replying these messages one after the other, WhatsApp suddenly blockes my account and asks me to go on a review, a Little while after, they will open my account for me and apologize to me saying that it was accidental that their systems flagged down my account. When I still go back to continue repling my unread messages, it blockes my account again.. this is very serious, pls do something l"
"It's has become a very bad application updating it to new version. No backups, even the stickers which are being add to WhatsApp will automatically be removed from what's app. Idk y it is happening so... Very disappointed with this app now a days 😐.... please rectify the error or no choose than uninstalling it..."
When someone calls me in WhatsApp it was automatically rejecting calls. It was happening for 2 calls and if someone keep calling 3rd time then only I'm getting calls. Its weird. I tried to uninstall app multiple times but still no success. Plz fix this issue ASAP.
"Photos' quality option is set to ""Best Quality"" but WhatsApp still reduces the quality to such a bad one that I feel bad to send it to others and putting any photo as status, it just blurres out the quality. WhatsApp team should look into this.. I am reducing the stars since this is a serious problem."
It is a great app so far but I have been experiencing problems trying to send audio then the the app stops working and close even after updating the problem still persists. I would have given 5star but due to that problem you get 4star. Try and fix that
"Please WhatsApp, on the status write-up feature, it would be best to alert the user when words has reached the limit the app can hold instead of cutting it making it look like an unfinished work to its status. This shouldn't be done without the permission of the user. Thank you WhatsApp"
App not accessing my phone's pics and videos. I am trying to add a video on WhatsApp status and there is no option for that. Tried to send the same video to another WhatsApp number and it is not recognising the media in my phone. All happened after app update.
I'm facing this problem- I did not receive notification when message in. Not even a beep tone. Can you pls fix the bug. Other function/apss goes well. Thank you.
"when the app crashed, ALL OF MY CHAT HISTORY suddenly went missing. And the number that shown in my homepage is the old one instead people that frequently I talked to. Also, I can't see all of the story from my friends. THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING."
"It's good but needs more improvement. And again security options of being able to lock private chats, should be looked into. Very important... Pls adhere Pls return the copy icon back on the screen like it used to be."
"Terrible update, most recent photos can not be view via whatsapp only through the gallery which is very frustrating when trying to upload something on to whatsapp, you have to go through so much admin to get a picture uploaded. Please revert back to old method"
"Yes, all albums are now hiding under 3 dots. Which is making use of or selection of media taking longer than ever. Never thought of an update should cause difficulty over ease about it."
"Good experience! But i have to say that please add more options to it such that i can add my name at the top of home screen (instead of whatsapp). Also add an option ""who can text me"".There is always more to learn about, good work keep it up,"
"Hey friends, this app is really fantastic. It displaya a vital role in the in our daily life routine. A simple and an easy way to send messages, having calls across the world for free and groups chatting as well. It's very secured app that one can trust, no one can read your private chats not even wattsapp."
"Unhappy! I send lots of photos I've taken with my phone and the recent update makes that so difficult! Please put it back, or give me the option to choose a default for myself!"
Not able to send screenshot directly through app need to go through gallery and while listening to any audio file the screen goes black not responding to any keys to get out of it or stop it.
"After the new update, when we delete today's messages from any contact and if the last conversation was 5 days before, then also it is showing that contact on top of the list in whatsapp, bcoz latest conversation was today's, this is really very annoying, otherwise it is good app,"
"It is really effective but I suggest you create a place for hidden chats different from archived, I mean an area that you can hide chats and an equally hidden place for the selected apps to be hidden, though the app is really good. I really think it is missing dis function"
It's been really frustrating since the last update where you can't send multiple files at a time and it's been auto choosing only the WhatsApp gallery rather than my main one.
"It a fascinating experience with WhatsApp. I appreciate your team. I have humble request that, to get one more function for short video message, it should be alternative for audio message, user should get 30 sec. or few more seconds to share there video message. Thankyou"
"This app has changed for the worst ..... restoration of the backup process is full of glitches which can easily cause you to lose access to all your becked up chat ,madia, etc customer come is non existent when it comes to any solving issues."
"Whatsapp please solve these problems: 1) Increase the duration of the video posted on Status from 30 sec to 60 sec. Add some good features to the status. 2) If we put HD video on the status, then it is sent in very poor quality. Fix it. 3) The stickers of whatsapp are not updated, while there are many stickers available on telegram like cartoons and k-pop idols stickers etc. So improve the stickers too. 4) When we delete the msg for everyone, the receiver should not know this. So fix that too..."
"Without a doubt, Most handy and useful app. Looking for a update in which same Whatsapp Messenger database and backup can be used to start Whatsapp Business account. Its been long i need to opt for Whatsapp Business but unable to do so as i have many Client information on my Normal Whatsapp Messenger. If there is any option available for the same.. Kindly let me know."
"During video call camara is freezing(automatically turned off and on) offenly...not only for me,same issue for others as well. So I request to resolve the issue ASAP for better experience."
I don't why the new update forces you to see the status of people when you click on their profile photo!!! What is your benifit as provider?!! Sure you don't want to save a click for me if I want to do so!!
Full of bugs does not work properly at all. You get message from invite click on it it takes you to play store the app asks you to open app. Then when you do the invite has disappeared.
"WA used to be great. The past month and a half while texting still functions, phone calls are useless. Has WA joined yt and twitter and fb as wokers. Good platforms becoming useless.🇺🇲"
"I really loved it and liked it, it is the best application in the world, but what left is the tabs... I want seperated chat and group section because it's hard to me to find the group between so many chats, please I request that develop a separate chat and group section. I am sure that everyone will like it, they will definitely find it easy to look for groups, please.... Add this feature in this..... Everyone wants this....."
"What is wrong with whatsapp? Before, while you are in VideoCall if you move your picture from left》right or up》down and minimize the call your picture follows where you moved it, but now it stays always on the lower right of the minimized VC. I hate it!!!!please fix this!!!"
"It's good and all but I do not like the new format in which the phone number and name is being display. I literally can't tell if I've saved a particular number or not. I like the old format better, please fix it"
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS THINKS DO WHATSAPP There is not safety options Put the control and disable of voice and video calls.. When ever deleted calls set the option ofter show one click .... Remember it's a family or kids also can miss use this direct calling by whatsApp.. Give a track to these network sim card's using to track callrecords. if these options not able to develop software simply delete ur services from my country.
"Why is the app checking my contacts almost 50 times at least every other day? I understand that the app needs access to contacts to be able to add new contacts that have whatsapp to its contact list, but it does not justify checking contacts every 10-30 minutes."
"great, i use it for years. but recently, the camera is not working. the front camera can work, but the main camera doesn't. I have allowed camera app access, even reinstall of the app but no change. how to handle it?"
It's been fun but it will be great to be able to mute all chats or restrict people in a way that no one can send you a message. Or probably go incognito without having to delete the app.
"It's nice, but please remove the setting whether we can see that person is online or not. Not last seen, but the online one. That thing is important. It's not abt privacy. It's abt the relationship that will be affected by it. The read receipts too. Please remove them. It is really unnecessary and unhelpful in my relationship."
"This app is really useful for me as its layout is easy to understand, and new users can explore the app quickly. I use dark mode because it helps my eyesight and it looks better, and I would recommend it to anyone using WhatsApp."
"WhatsApp stopped working, so I uninstalled and reinstalled. Since doing so, I can't use the app at all! It is demanding that I share ALL my phone contacts so it can ""help"" me keep in contact. I never had to do that before. I only use WhatsApp to keep up with friends overseas, and those are rhe only people's contact info I want in the app. What gives here? Is Meta now so excessively greedy for data to try to force consent of users to give more than needed? Cust service did nothing to help."
"It is the best free messaging app that I've come across so far, ideal for video and voice calls, sending instant messages and uploading stories (photos and sort videos). Ideal timepass for parents, aunties and uncles so that they will leave youngsters alone."
Stupid update. I want to meet the idiot who choose to change the feature of attaching photos from Gallery - Camera or Screenshots.... And also I would like to meet the Manager who approved the changes. Roll back the old features.
"After last update,Whatsapp will hang at automatic backing up consuming battery continuously trying to backing up until you notice it and either cancel or manually backup. By then most of the battery is used up."
"On the current update (Samsung), I can no longer view videos either that I sent or that were sent to me. Please fix this bug so that I can connect with my family and friends again, and I will update this review!"
"After the update, text stories goes bad. No font size feature. No left and Right incident feature. For arabic and English.... Same old colors. No new colors panel. Plz update the text stories features and bugs."
"The app is good but since two months that I updated it again and again, I found out that the paragraph key arrow is not available on my WhatsApp. This is very frustrating because it prevents me from typing long notes. Please the developers should reinstall this vital paragraph key. Thank you"
"Many problems are coming, like 1. Automatic reset & ask to restore the chat, 2. Status keeps playing even after going back, 3. Few messages unable to send, if you send again, then the previous msg also gets sent. 4. WhatsApp web chat restore problem, 5. Old pictures unable to download. Still I use this app so 2 star."
"Awesome app always, Still December 2022, I didn't faced any issue in whatsApp but i reinstalled recently after that not able to restore the data and media files are not downloading. Please resolve the issue ASAP."
"Whatsapp was good initially when there was no competitor in cross-platform communication (using since 2012). Now (in 2022) with the growth of similar other apps, it lacks basic features like cloud storage and multi device (multiple phones) support. Also, ios whatsapp is not so well baked."
How fantastic will birthday feature be on WhatsApp? What if WhatsApp is integrated to pull birthday or event list from Facebook which contains such BioData. It will go a long way to stay up to date with important events that matter to our contacts . Events can be added to the status tab on WhatsApp! Happy New Year
"I really like to use whatsapp. But I can't record any voice notes for several months. I always have to restart my phone then after 2 or 3 minutes again it shows "" can't set up the recorder now please try again later"" I'm so done with this... I have to restart my phone so many times in a day. Its not my phone's problem. I tried it in my other phone and face the same problem. I hope you fix this problem and I can use voice notes."
"No one would like these update of watsapp. If we want that feel and easiness than we can use Instagram, why you all adding all features inspired by insta. We don't want that . Please remove these update , specially that one where we can't see someone's dp instead that it's shows their status. I hate that all new features. Please remove that 🙏. Thanks ."
"One app that has seen a tremendous jump in its users as well as public interest in last decade. All in one, from sending photos to documents to anything you need. It's like a full on power package and a reliable application with security and privacy. Love the way, WhatsApp team is continuously working to bring great updates and features. the layout and user interface and every feature is improving with time and hoping for more in near future. We expect a lot now from this amazing team."
"Very laggy and bad pictures. Also, calls are keep getting off and losing connecting when trying to call. Messenger is way better than this and I wouldn't recommend this app"
"Yeh'this is amazing and amazing. It connects us with our family members, friends and many more. I like it so much. It's also help in my education. It's best for transferring photos, notes, vedios and many more Thanks whatsApp. 💓"
"Was a great app until latest update. Was using with tablet and portal. Latest update eliminated tablet. Switched to new android phone. Downloaded latest version of Whatsapp, factory reset Portal, linked phone to portal. Setup all seemed to go well. Contacts were linked, made call and went through no problem. Incoming calls however could not be answered on portal. When answer button was pressed call dropped from portal and could only be answered on phone. Online tech support was no help."
"When trying to send photos in the app, I can no longer select photos from any photo album other than the whatsapp one. Happened with the most recent phone update (galaxy s22). Super frustrating."
"Since the latest update, you're unable to select photos from your gallery directly. You have to click on the 3 dots and select them. No multi select of photos either. Needs fixing ASAP."
When ever I need to fix something it always makes me restart all the messaging works but it won't let you do anything else it says Whatsapp has some problems get out of app in the middle of one of my calls 🥺 I kept trying over and over it did not work but let me say Whatsapp is an ok app you can still message and call 🤙 and that is enough ☺️
It's great but please control the shut down of servers please 🥺 And I also have a request... Please make a process for setting up contacts or groups under different headings which can be set by the user.. like friends or college or work or friends group or work place group Please look into this matter it would make the UI experience much easier ❤️❤️
"One the most useful applications in the world. It's quite easy. From a young person to an old, any one can use WhatsApp without any hesitation. WhatsApp is not only for chatting, video calls. It's a great platform for sharing the day to day life of people to their nears and dears."
"Everything goes very well, only the transfer of materials from Android to iPhone is not yet. You are a very professional app and this issue should have been resolved a long time ago. All apps can be opened on two or three phones. When will whatt app solve this? Thanks!"
"Cant access my account, its been 24 hours I cant log into my account, I wrote email and received clarification that it has no issues but still cant connect my account. I need to access my data. I have no backup. Please resolve this issue as soon as possible. I request to look into this matter 😭🙏"
"After updating new version of this app, most of the time video caller image is not visible ( or totally blank). So for resolving this issue, we again tried to make a call. So please tried to resolve this issue."
"I've been using whatsapp for a long time and this is the first time it happen but before i update the app i can still send a video to status but after i update it i can't send a video, at first i don't think much because it's only some video i can't send but then suddenly i can't post any video on status. I don't know if this is just from the app or it's my phone being so old"
"Can you please enable function like Telegram app for chat history? Every time new member join in the group, you always need to send the same information again but instead of that how about you make it visible for the new members to read earlier chat like how Telegram did? Its become easier sometimes there's a lot of past information and the new members couldn't read what it was/were. Please take this into consideration 🙏"
I hate the second last update from what's app in that update we can't adjust camera while we're on video and specially it's disturbing in mini screen i can't adjust the angle the camera stand at right corner down and that's why i can't get proper visualisation of opposite person and one i humbly request you to pls do video call function as old its not convenient to me I'm total disturb by this update of whats app Thank you
"For the developers only ... When someone deletes a message we can still see a message ""This message was deleted"". It is really annoying. If I can't read the message anymore what's the point of letting me know he/she deleted the message. Once a message is deleted there should not be any trace left over."
"Most probably one of the best chatting apps out there, but it would be really nice when someone's trying to make a new group chat, why can't it ask you whether you want to join or not, some of us got enough or too much groups and also when the chat backup wants to backup, why can't there be a time selection, every 2nd or 3rd day it wants to backup, it's trying to do so just as I'm about to leave home to go to work, and that's so frustrating. Setting a time would be super convenient...!"
Thanks WhatsApp community to heard my previous problem and fixed it ... But there we still need two options **First of all** when someone ping (mentioned me) more than ones in 'group chats' after replying first message I always lost the other ones . Please give a new option where we can go and check those messages someone mentioned me .... **Second one** Pin message system. Sometimes we have some shorta messages or news we need to pin for all group members can see .
"Voice note not working? Try this. Turn off your ""hey Google"" wake up command and restart your phone, it has some sort of hierarchy over Whatsapp and blocks the app from using the microphone. So weird but it worked for me. 😀"
"Photo sharing just got harder... Pre the last update sharing photos from my gallery was easy and straightforward. Now if I'm trying to attach an image it takes over double/triple the time to do it... why: 1. Default is now just to show me WhatsApp images (most I'm sharing are actually camera or screenshots so that is tricky) 2. I use my gallery a lot am used to the layout where to find my pics the new ""promote only WhatsApp pics"" means I can't navigate easily. Please revert!!"
Hii WhatsApp users... You should add one feature that i am suggesting... The feature is just like who saw our status...than it shows the list at middle of the bottom...but you should also add this with The DP...so we would recognise who has seen our dp...as how many times... It is a humble request to add this feature with respect to your terms and conditions...
Almost everything's fine but now we need song option in status same like Instagram and Facebook story. Now add that option in whatsapp also. So we can put any song on our whatsap status. This feature will make whatsap awesome.
It's an awesome app but i don't like recent update..coz of that update the chat box in which we have deleted recent chat stays on front.. it's problematic ! Please change that in new update. Chat box view should be in ascending order acxording to time.. not according to last chated with.
"Whatsapp become worse and thats bugs me because I faced more than twice to try send a message but it's not sending. I thought it's my connection problems but it is not, the problem in WhatsApp application. in addition, when someone is calling me, it show him that I have another call but I am not in call."
Since my last update my profile picture keeps disappering anytime i oprn tge app. I constantly have to keep reuploading my profile picture and every time i reopen the app the picture disappers again...pls fix this problem as it is very frustrating
- Hello...Can we Pin atleast four Chats ? - There has to be a feature of text highlighting (with different coulours as well) - Can we have an analysis graph (That could show us daily about the various data like :- 1. How much time we are spending on which chat 2. In which Chat we are messagimg the most. 3. How much time have consumed on whatsapp today.)
Last update broke the ability to sort conversations automatically after deleting some messages. Seems to only affects the android version as the iphone version seems fine.
"The new updates have better features but for some reason, the app just keeps crashing, I have had to clear my WhatsApp thrice between last month and now for no reason And I have tried to avoid this so much I cleared my cache, updated my system and WhatsApp, confirmed background data was on and it still keeps on crashing What's going on?"
"Great messaging application. Can you add feature to limit number of messages per day per member in a group to stop flooding of messages by anyone (except admins) especially large groups. Also, if you could add feature to temporarily suspend a user for given number of days from say 1 to 10 days. This will save the abusing of groups by anyone and also will have cleaner messaging platform."
"Please fix the problem, when upload video on status, video quality got really bad. Video compression process is too big. Makes the video really bad, and make the fps drop."
"The app is very usefull but why I can't send a video more than 17mb and the video or photo got always compressed due to which quality becomes poor while sending to others. My friends can send actual quality containt but I can't. Why this happens, developer please reply."
It's great app and I have been using it for a long time but now I started facing a issue that some messages are automatically deleted from the contacts. Messages are shown in desktop version of whatsapp but not on phone. I am just facing this issue otherwise this app is great
"WhatsApp is an easy to use and very common app for communication however there is still no option to block status of selected contacts, you have to block or delete the contact to block their statuses. Some people's statuses are not suitable for others, so their is a need of option to allow statuses from selected contacts only."
"I use a Samsung s22 ultra does anyone know why I get this pop up during a what's app call? ""Call ended because there's a problem with your phone's microphone."" The call ends immediately after this pops up. I've changed the phone it still says the same thing."
"Having the same problem as many others: since the upgrade, I cannot easily send pictures via WhatsApp- I have to go to Gallery and do it through there. I still gave 3 stars because overall WhatsApp is great and incredibly useful but this needs to be sorted."
"Roll back center alignment for written whatsapp story. Also the font reduction makes it too small. I can say even if the number if characters are reduced, it won't harm as much this reduced font and right alignment is doing. Counting on you."
"Can your devs please include a means to edit status captions? It's high time that feature is included. Secondly, please enable the enter key so that one can type status captions and space out words instead of writing it on note pad first then copy and paste. Many thanks!"
"The recent update makes my phone shut down everyone I try to make a call. I raised a support ticket to WhatsApp that got closed down without any assistance at all. Additionally, the inclusion of Grammerly cannot be turned off, I have asked!"
Nice and original app..... it has all I want even video's and photos uploading are very fast❤️ voice note is also very fast And all security settings are completed in it.👍... ( Download yours ).
"Pictures sent to me don't show in my gallery, Wat is d problem please or wat should I do???? And have tried backing up my chats and pictures twice now, once it gets to 99%, it's shows not able to back up or check ur internet connection Why is that happening please. Thanks. And something's should be done about it or is it from my phone?"
"Best messaging app! It has everything including emoticons, photos, what's web. But in what's web instant of asking for QR code scan YOu can keep a pascode. You can keep themes for text other than black and white. You can allow what's web user to video call via what's app. You should allow to send video of every time limit . Please refer to these ideas and I would love to see these changes in next update! Please reply"
"Whatsapp seems to be problematic lately. I am connected to a very fast wifi network yet everything on my phone is working except for WhatsApp. Cannot send or receive messages, it is extremely frustrating. Why is this happening?"
"I have problems when sending PDF files using whatsapp desktop(win 10), the files always corrupted and cannot be downloaded nor open. the problem only exist on the desktop aplication. the other aplication like android and whatsapp web(chrome) are doing well. Please help"
"Wish the camera worked better through the app. Photos always come out blurry. I find myself always having to exit out of the app, take a photo, then open the app and attach it."
"The updated has logged me off completely ,it has being difficult to view my messages neither would i preview anything again, is there anything wrong with this whatsapp ?kindly fix this issue and let us continue enjoy the app as usual. thank you."
"Recently I've not been getting notifications pop up for new messages, not changed any settings for this to happen. It's really starting to annoy me now, sort it please and quickly."
"I absolutely love it!! The only thing I have a issue with is the calling and video calls don't work the greatest, and it kills alot of battery.."
I don't understand why doesn't WhatsApp allow us update media and backup chats in roaming? It should let users decide if they are willing to use roaming internet data or not. Do something about it. Apart from it I am missing the crop feature of image upload in the Windows desktop version.
"Seems latest version has a bug. When I try to access messages on one of my groups, am exited from the app instantly with a popup, 'whatsapp stopped because of a bug, download the next update from developer'. Urgently investigate and provide an update to the bug."
"You went from 5 to 2 stars when you put send button below delete button, doing away with new line button. Now when I want to correct I end up sending incomplete, incorrect post. And starting new line is not an option at all. Boo hiss. You can do better. I'll be waiting. Lol"
"Agree with all the people complaining about the ""new way of attaching"" pictures. Having to click the 3 dots, finding gallery and the whole 9 yards is so time consuming. Who at Meta thought that people just want to see the media that's in WhatsApp already? If ain't broken don't fix it. One star until you revert the brilliant idea."
A bad update. Like others havr alluded to. The pathway for image attachments has changed. Why on earth mess around with something so critical? Just change it back please as now its such clicknfest to just be able to attach from whatsapp to your phone gallery.
"In your next update, kindly include option to remove being online while on whatsapp. Privacy is the key🤗 Also consider this update, a seperate page for groups and individual chats. It'll be very useful. Thankyou Edit : Thankyou for listening to my one query (online privacy) Next can you plz add one seperate tab for groups. It's really annoying sometimes. Thankyou"
"after recent update lots of functionality is causing app to crash. like clicking on links in status, view poll results. not able to view the question in the poll. videos in WhatsApp status also not playing"
It's okay for messaging. I mean everyone uses it so you're missing out if you don't. But that aside telegram is way better. Fix your video call quality and leave modders alone if you won't provide the options they want like downloading status. Why won't people use mod Whatsapp. Stop blocking the accounts.
The app is amazing but now I don't like the latest version because in this version the online option which can be hide from your contacts that thy will not be able to find you online or offline. Such type of online option is very baseless and bad. So I shared my experience about this version. I request you to remove this option from whatsapp so that will be more beneficial. I am using this app since 5 years but now i want to get rid of this because of this version. I hope you'll be review..
"Ever since I update this app, I've not been able to open links directly from it. I'll have to copy link and go paste in the browser. I'm scared of updating to the latest version now because I don't what next might have been removed."
I can't update my status on the app . The app is good but now it doesn't show the correct number of status views after a time. Also I would like if the new version will have a separate bar for group chats and also make it possible to save status to phone gallery once you view it without leaving the app.
"The new update is not what expected ,it become worst .if we delete any unwanted message in a chat or group chat ,it does not organise accordingly to date and time received .It will remain as the time and date for that deleted message .Appear on top of the chat list can be one we last received few week ago by delete in latest incoming message .please sort it out ,very annoying ."
"I was really pleased with WhatsApp until the recent update arrived. I mean whatsapp already had three separate spaces for 'chats', 'status' and 'calls'. So then why are you interlinking between chats & status and making us see all the status whenever we want to see a person's dp and not even letting us zoom it to see properly!! We will see the status of our friends when we want, why are you forcing us?? This last update is really ridiculous & frustrating."
"Dear WhatsApp Team, I have not done anything wrong and I'm sure I follow whatsApp rules and guidance. My account is suspend with out and reason. Please review on my account and resolve as soon as possible. And wrote mail four times to WhatsApp support, but still not resolve. This account is very important to me. Kindly check and resolve the problem as soon as possible. Thank you. Ramesh."
Recently updated my software to Oxygen OS 13 in One Plus 10 R. Whenever I try to send Images/Videos it only shows me images/videos sent in Whatsapp it is not showing all media. I had to go in photos app and then share it on whatsapp.
"The worst update (version 2.22.24.78) I have ever seen in my life. Audio and video clarity, modules are changed and it's really a bad experience for me."
"Since the new update has come, if I want to keep any status, then the gallary photos and videos are not showing on WhatsApp.only those photos are being shown which are whatsapp images now whenever i have to put status i have to upload from direct gallery plz fix this problem as soon as possible"
"Been using WhatsApp group for working/duty report purpose. It is better if sorting/filtering option for date is done, so that we don't have to scroll up/down to look for previous/old chats."
"There is a small bug in the latest update. When I go to search and select documents, the entire list of documents that | have shared and received is presented to me. This list is sorted according to the date it was sent or received. The newest documents are shown first. Now if | start scrolling down this list after scrolling through few documents the app suddenly scrolls down to the bottom of this list and there is no way other than to scroll through the entire to reach the top again.."
For past two months the media from gallery keeps disappearing repeatedly even when the media visibility is turned on. The updates did not fix this bug still . I'm using Samsung s22 ultra. Kindly look into it.
"Whatsapp calls run in background after hanging up the call. Problems: My media volume is inaudible, I cannot record a video while the call is running in background."
"Amazing app but I discovered a bug. Whenever I want to reply to a status with a voice note locked and I cancel it, I'm unable to reply that status again I'd be so happy you look into this"
"Hello. My mobile phone is redme note 9pro. In the new version of WhatsApp, the date of the messages I receive is a few hours later and the new messages do not appear on the top of the chat screen! For example, if a message is sent to me at 5 pm, it will be displayed on the chat page at 9 am. What can I do?"
The latest ver doesn't allow me to restore my backup chats (both local and online) . It only directs me to google drive backup restore yet doesn't detect the backup file. It's frustating
"i've updated the app until it's latest update, i can send view once pics and receive them as well, but when it comes to one person, i can't see their view once media because i have to ""update the app"" even though i already have the latest update. please fix this !!!"
"For messaging, it's fine but when it come to cloud storage and all that, this app really doesn't do the job. When you try to download a file, that you've forgotten to, it cannot be downloaded anymore even though the file is still there, and it tells you to tell the sender to send it one more time, which is why I wonder why you need the file there if you can't download it after a period of time. Another thing is, this app cannot let you log in on both devices which is really inconvenient."
"Good app, there's no doubts, but I can't stand for being forced to see the contact's status when I opened the profile picture! If I'd like to see the status' picture I'll go and open it myself!"
"My go to messaging app! Has voice and video call, create groups for business colleagues or for you and your friends and now the new avatar option which let's you create an AI version of yourself for your profile picture! Just overall a great platform and will continue using 👍"
Very inconvenience to make a conversation after you login from a new device. Only display the group chat. Person chat dispersed totally even can not find out from phone book if the people not allow WhatsApp to view it. Only one way to resolve it is that wait for the people contact with you at next time.
"Devs, please explain something to me. I saw on a YouTube video that WhatsApp has increased the file size support to 2 GB. I have a screen record that is close to 40 minutes long, but it's only 76 MB, why won't it upload the entire 40 minutes? (actually about 36 minutes) I had to upload it to my cloud storage to send it to my family."
"When I'm in a conference call with 2 other ppl, the audio levels are not normalized. When I can hear one person, the other is too quiet. When I turn the volume up, then the loud person is way too loud and it's unbearable. But that's the only way to hear both. The support desk just sends automated responses which don't provide any resolution."
"Whatsapp calling Worked perfectly and all of a sudden i cannot receive calls only make calls. Checked all the settings, all is in place. Also updated and still not working"
"The video call volume is so loud ! I cant even mute the person i called , my volume is on it's lowest yet it's extremely loud. It's really annoying. Also why can't i rotate video calls it always automatically rotates to the wrong side"
"Security is the major concern for everyone, users and developers, when using any apps on their mobile. Earlier I created a 6 digit PIN in my whatsApp app, unnecessarily,(my conversation are automatically deleted every weekend) and every time I opened whatsApp it asked for this PIN. However when I tap on the link on the notification bar, it opened the app and surprisingly it it didn't asked for the PIN. Am I not vulnerable here? That's why the 5 stars."
Overall A good App with Some Useful features.They always trying to improve featurs but not Security. We haven't received security updates for long time but there were some minor security updates. Bc of Mod Whatsapp Users there will be no change even if we delete our msgs.I think Unsend option might help this problem.
There is something wrong with your app. Whenever I try to upload a video on my status it tells me that this video cannot be played and that's not all.. Also it doesn't play any other videos from my contacts status. Fix it for god sake
"Didnt fix the screen goes black when playing voice notes. Dont treat it as voice call please. Its annoying.. Edit: after the update, video call ended when we access camera or send photoes through chat."
"Really love using whatsapp however I've been facing a bug lately and idk where else i could complain about this. Whenever I try to scroll up looking for a chat a few hours ago, WhatsApp seems to automatically scrolled to yesterday's chat, and when i try to scroll down again it brought me back to my latest chat. If you get what i mean. Its really annoying! Pls fix asap!!"
"The last update was awful, I wanted to send my camera photo which the latest photos of I what I took but its not appearing in the album, only shows the photos has received or sent via Whatsapp. Thats so annoying!!!"
"Live location sharing does not work if I switch off the screen. In other words, if I want my family to see my live location, I will have to keep the screen on. Unfortunately, this is not helpful because the screen being on all the time, will drain the battery."
"I'm having an issue with the 'reaction notification'. It's quite annoying to receive a notification, everytime someone reacts to your messages. I tried turning it off, but it appears, it made no difference. I'm still receiving the reaction notification, even after turning it off. One more thing. I noticed that if we or the other person, reacts to the last message sent, it appears on the main page of WhatsApp as 'Reacted to: (message), under their name. I would prefer the message itself."
"The app has now great changes in fonts , message yourself , poll , just having one suggestion please chnage the muted the call text , it always remains in the center and annoys during video call."
"Im not sure why but when i take a photo or video it doesn't show up when i want to send it to someone even though i have media visibility on, this has just recently started to happen and it is quite annoying."
"Two missing stars bcoz of 2 cons. 1. No customizable timer in ""Disappearing message"". At least add ""3 days"", please. 2. It would be nice to be able to turn off/pause the app's access to net quickly and easily, and without having to tinker with phone's settings. I don't even know if i can block net access in phone's setting. One would need too many tappings anyhow. Everything else is good.."
Great app for communicating. Only problem I have is with the quality of the images/videos I post on my status. They always turn out blurry(I don't have an old phone). Please fix the issue.
"The new change, where user see day instead of date for the whole previous week, really disappointed. Before in WhatsApp business version, this feature bothered me all the time. In business you make arrangements with date instead of day means the first priority is date but now it shows yesterday, then Monday, then Sunday & Saturday so at the end you have to open the calendar separately to know what was the date on last Saturday. 1 star rating for this."
I really love using this app since l can communicate with family and friends but l suggest that we would also have some themes to add the enjoyment of this app and some fiiire so that we don't use GB whatsapp cause l hate seeing deleted stuff.... The only way you can improve and whatsapp is just themes otherwise l love this app 💕...to give the app a little padazel ✨and enjoy texting others in style
"Hi, please improve the whatsapp, its a bit hard to do a voice call now, there's only calling when they on other voice call no more notice that they are in other call, sometime it's just calling without ringing, or not even ringing, please improve all this for better communication, I love whatsapp but lately the whatsapp seems a bit annoying, please notice, I hope you guys be better, after all good I'll be good on 5 stars hehe"
"This app reduced picture quality a lot... It's tiring that you don't get the exact picture quality sent tojyou.... The picture quality should be improved... Posting pictures on the status is also tiring due to low quality.. And now, links can't be accessed through this app"
Completely messed up after the last update. I can't send pictures without having to go into the gallery and can't send multiple photos! What nonsense!
"Whatsapp is literally like broken I can't excess my videos and can't add more photos and I can send a photo of my own and the person who did this people are disappointed of you rn so it better if you change to the old one it more better then the new update , I don't even know who did this but this is so bad who ever did this you should be a shame that WhatsApp is having low reviews than last time. I was about to give you a good review but since the new update I'm giving it a one star."
My whatapp app (on Android) has been making backup randomly multiple times through the day even after successful backup done in the morning. This is getting frustrating keep seeing it performing backups.
"This application is good enough. Although it needs to improve a lot. UI should be more elegant and much more pleasant. And next thing is many more business directly contact through WhatsApp, however I didn't sign up for this. This should be noted. And also try to reduce spam accounts so that all users can use this application with a positive attitude . Thank you~"
I my friends my family my university fellows even anyone used this app frequently and even every times this centurie. When I am used this app I amazed and appreciated what's up Massager . This app work in less packages . This thousands features easy our lives like groups and community's . We chat's each other very easily. Any one knows each other's status. The whatsapp status can feature like very much . We can talk and see in foreign countries relatives and friends easier though the video call
"Well, this latest update is so bad, my access to a gallery is so bad, pictures sending option is bed, limited to 30 photos only, very bad, hopefully this will be fixed, other than that, good app."
The update made everything worse. I cant send or post anythong from WhatsApp. I have to go to my gallery just to post something. And.....my account has also been blocked even when i use different numbers ro create a new account on WhatsApp. Pleas fix this.. pleeeease. It is a good app tho
I'm having a issue while Video calling with my friends.. It's showing like connecting and suddenly shows an msg like call failed.. I'm having a Good network in my area even though can't connect.. I'm facing this issue on last few days.. Kindly resolve this...
Had the same experience as others regarding not being able to send videos/media. I had to resort to deleting the app and reinstalling and it now works but lost all my chats.
"Experience is not very good. Every ten/fifteen days asking for updatin-what's this? For updating, it Is taking hours and consuming a lot of data. Very poorly managed application. If it goes on like this, I would think for other options."
"after latest update, recent photos no longer shows up and i have to go through few steps to select it. also cannot select multiple photos at once! this is so frustrating :( please return it like how it used to!!"
"What's going on with gallery photos?? It's been stated a few times now, cannot access photos i have taken from the gallery to send and it's a pain in the rectum. Get it sorted. It was fine before the latest update. Why ""fix"" something that isn't broken."
"I hope WhatsApp make status simpler. The new contact exception button, give me accidental embarrassing moment because it's confusing. I mean, the name ""contact exception"", but the contact I check, they received the status as messages. So one star. I don't wanna everyone received my status."
Very complex to send pictures since last update. Need to enter from gallery and then select and share. Impossible directly from what'sapp to select pictures.
"In a world of distractions you often want simple solutions and that is why WhatsApp was my messaging app of choice, but with the newest updates you can see how the app is turning into a social network... These changes are not for me."
"After a recent update, i am not able to make voice and video calls. I am able to listen, but my voice is not audible to the receiver, and sometimes it lags."
Further to the review from Robin Deacon on 25th November I hope there is a solution to adding photos soon as it was brilliant before and now it is really unhelpful. I have to go to photos then upload rather than being able to upload multiple images from WhatsApp. The functionality was great up until the last upgrade.
"For some time I inserted another sim with my existing Sim in my Galaxy M31. Thereafter I removed the second sim but, some contacts somehow are being shown in WhatsApp which are not saved in my phone/contacts. There is no option to delete them, nor refreshing contacts is deleting contacts saved in second sim. Please fix it. The second sim and Google account is different from this sim number and Google account and yet why something like this happened?"
"My phone is connected to wifi in my house suddenly whatsapp only is not getting internet especially mine, other phones whatsapp is working fine, i didn't do any settings or never restricted the app. Tried several times to restart the app and phone no use. Uninstalled and try to install the app it shows please try after 5min.."
"I use whatsapp for connecting with all of my clients however, there must be something wrong as I am not able to set sound for notification so i would not know if i got a message or reply. If u have aby helpful tip on how to fix this problem , it would be much appreciated. Thank you."
When it works its great but since I changed phones and it won't send me the verification code although I've allowed all permissions and also emailed customer service and they can't help because it has to be sent via text or call...
"After the update, the new features are not good as many photos and videos are not visible during the status update or sending someone. I just hate this new update please bring the previous update."
"It's 75% good as it communication video calls some time network signal is excellent but the face of the opponent is not clear at all, and I don't know why!"
"[🦊] —The best app for chatting and calling. But for me, there's one downside. You cannot correct a message after it has been sent. —Хорошее приложение для общения и звонков. Но для меня есть один минус. Нельзя исправить сообщение после отправления."
I love the app! But can we have a way to sort our stared stickers? It would make life much easier. Also the photo quality is bad. My friends and I have started to email photos to eachother because Whatsapp ruins the photos.
Keeps telling me I need an internet connection when I already have one. This plus the other issues that most of us have already complained about which don't get fixed renders the app pretty damn useless at the best of times. Had to give it a star to write the review. Doesn't give the option to restore from backup lost all chats absolute shi*e. Won't be using it again. Was once a great app. Sick of all the issues.
Love WhatsApp but please have a lock feature during calls. I keep accidentally adding participants to the call bc my finger slipped. Also since the update more glitches of blurry video and cutting in and out.
"Hii team ,last update was worst experience, when i was watching status automatically it showing black video,and video running in background, please fix this glitch. Thank you team @whatsapp"
please remove the security features for View once photos. majority ppl don't send anything confidential.. they just simply share a snap which one might not send otherwise thinking it is not worth it but we share it because we know its not important and seeing for once at the moment is enough
"WhatsApp is getting frustrating. Because why? They ban me severally without doing anything wrong and they keep repeating it severally to the extent of suspending my account twice daily. You should work on it please. It's frustrating. When you've corrected it, I'll give you 5 stars"
Amazing messaging app. It would be better if you add a feature that asks confirmation before sending a voice message as many times unnecessary voice messages are mistakenly sent.
"Why there is no notification coming when someone call me, the notification sometime disappear until I open the apps, is so annoying when I don't get notifications when someone text or call me, I always miss it and they are angry to me, please fix it, phone call or video call incoming notification are not pop up, it just disappear, but when I open the apps is pop up, I don't know why but please fix it, also please add auto answer for my family call"
This app is so easy to use and I use it everyday to communicate with friends family clients and classmates. It does have problems with the internet connection and sometimes phone calls are a problem but it is the best app that I've used so far
Whats wrong with selecting the photo from the default camera gallery? Why the recent update caused this inconvenience? No way to attach multiple photos at one go now.
"After the latest update when I try to use attach icon n go inside gallery I'm not able to select multiple photos from it. Only one photo at a time is possible. Kindly rectify this issue. Only direct from gallery, using share icon I'm able to send pics or put the status."
"When i send msgs, it's not showing a double tick... instead only one tick, even though the person on the other end has already seen and replied to the msg. It's happening on every chat. Please do something about it."
"Alot of issues, ringtone not being supported, media not being downloadable after a while and having to ask people to resend them, etc. Not to mention the fact that you simply cant use your email to log in. 1/5, might delete my app and forget about this entiredly"
"I am writing this review for some special people who don't know what is WhatsApp. WhatsApp is a platform of instant messages and voice-over-internet protocol service. It is the application that runs from a mobile device and also it is accessible from computers and laptops. More than five billion people over the world use it to stay in touch with family, friends, and colleagues at any time and anywhere. We can send messages, images, videos, emojis, voice calls, video calls, GIFs and many more."
"1. Where GIF search, emoji and stickers icons are available, the popular global audio search and sharing feature should be added. 2. Global sticker search feature is also needed. 3. There should be an option for poll: so that creator can choose to opt for single or multiple selection from the user."
FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT ACCESS TO GALLERY PHOTOS. After recent system/app update if you don't see your gallery photos when choosing attachment you need: GO to SETTING - APPS - Whatsapp - Permissions - Allow access to gallery/video/photos... Worked on samsung.
"The app lacks editing of text after being posted, unlike the Telegram app., also, the screen recorder cannot record the caller's voice but only that of the person I call."
"Not sure how true some articles I've seen are, but as a UK user please, PLEASE don't mess us over with some kind of ban. This app is literally my lifeline in keeping contact with family (because affording credit to text is expensive). 😭"
"The app is just fine, never faced any issues. But I was thinking if the Developer Team could grace us with tag all feature like we got in Slack where you have to type @channel and all the members are mentioned at once. It'd be a great thing I think."
"Everytime an update was released, there was a disappointment. Progress is less than deterioration. For example, every jump to a link or open document and go back to chat, we were positioned to the end of chat. It was annoying, when we had scroll up to an old chat several months before. So,.. what's the use of ""go to the end of chat"" button above ""send/mic"" button?"
"Recently I changed phones, WhatsApp does not accept my number on the new phone. It keeps on warning my old phone that someone is trying to enter into their account, which is mine. My SIM card is in my new phone,I don't get OPT's or verification calls from them. Just that I have tried too many times. So I wait the 48 hours before I can request a new OPT... No OPT, if I ask for a call, it says wait another 24 hours. I don't know how to fix this. I'm running a business and loosing clients."
Has been working perfectly until yesterday it refuses to open. Each time I try opening it only bounces back without any inform or explanation. Please help me do something about it because I can't update it though it's the newest update on November 16th. Please save this account details for me. Thanks
Whatsapp decided I needed to change my number. I live in 2 different countries. Sometimes I can't get a text notification. So now I'm locked out of my accout. My friends and family won't know what happened to me as we made the mistake of relying on this unreliable company to manage anything effectively.
Some features are not getting..ex:while recording some users get the new feature to pause record some users not getting the same after updating.. please add a option to add blocked contact in group
The app just stops sending and receiving messages... It shows waiting for messages but nothing comes in or goes out. It's annoying. This is the second time it's happening.
"Very good app! but some features should be in it such as status download,chats and groups should be separate,voice changer,lock conversation etc."
"Updates break this app. I'm using a pixel 4a. Audios freeze the app, I cannot text, pause or speedup the audios while they are playing. Calls close automatically on response half of the time."
"Dear Developer team, It is very good messenger app. But I am not happy with the current features yet. because every time I try to change my device or uninstall the app it needs to backup other wise I can't recover all chats and media after that I reinstall and re sign the same account on same number. It needs to restore . telegram is better than it in this case. please develop the case that nobody need to backup and restore the chat history. please develop like telegram."
"WhatsApp is a cross-platform messaging app that allows you to send text, photos, videos, and audio messages to other users. It uses the internet to make calls, send messages, and share media, so it can work on smartphones, tablets, and personal computers. It is available for iOS, Android, and other devices. Do you have any specific questions about WhatsApp?"
Amazing app..superb for messaging and calls. However recently my gallery is not showing when I open images. It's extremely inconvenient. Please fix this
"After updating, when I delete latest message from the chat/conversation, the chat is not changing as per the last available text time as it used to happen before. This way irrespective of deleting chat staying at top is not useful, please revert this change"
"There is a problem with video calling and voice calls they are not mostly clear and good quality,and I have to click on each individual photo to download in a group,like why can't it download immediately I see the sent message so frustrating"
"I'm very upset with this. Suddenly got logged out of my account for no reason and when i sent in a review it said my account cannot be used. How do i retrieve back my account!!!!! Im frustrated cuz only in the span of a few weeks since my fb got issues , it turned to insta and now ws."
"I don't get any notification plus when someone video call me through WhatsApp i have to go to the app and that's the major problem, my parents are saying i am breaking the phone or did something to it . Sometimes i also think why that is doing it. Pls fix that ."
"The app is awesome but for big data backup watsapp must have its own cloud space of 50gb for an individual also need more easy and fast backup option as Google drive is not so reliable for me it's too slow to upload and download both, also I got many many difficulty and it takes lots of days to do it for me"
Are you seriously not gonna fix the not being able to find literally the last photo you took or any video at all? It's been at least 3 weeks and it was something from the last update that should've been fixed within a day. Is this a start up or something?
Can't connect none of my phones and desktop app anymore. 🙄 It keeps saying - check your internet connection and try again... even though the internet is always there.... Are there any plans to fix an issue as it's been there for too long!
"The last update has made the app very poor in use, cant select the photo from gallery unless i slect the 3 dots on top whic is not convenient. And for some reason any downloaded picture is not saved in gallery and all my old pics got vannished"
Small bug: Scenario: 1. Start call 2. Bluetooth on 3. Bluetooth button doesn't activate when tapping. Results: Bluetooth headphones are not connected during call.
Bad Update Can't increase the size of text in Status. The text status update should have alignment and font size option. Lost all interest in Reading and Keeping Text status update.
"Sorting - Before this build , when I deleted any message - It used to go back to the last date on the message and the contact was sorted accordingly - Now even if I delete the message, the contact stays on the top even after the last message date is showing older - Can you please fix that ?"
"Please can we have our groups fall at the bottom of contact,or side swipe for groups,it's a mission to search through groups for personal messages from friends when you don't want to read all. Pinning more than 3 at the top wil help too."
It was great until 16 Nov update. We could adjust our own position in the window of Vidcall while in picture in picture mode. Now it only sticks to the bottom portion as soon as we go in picture in picture mode.
"Whatsapp has started to feel more like instagram. I don't like changes such as hidden online status, status shown instead of profile picture. I don't like reactions either. Whatsapp was vibe in itself. And now it seems mixture of messenger and Instagram. I might deactivate my Whatsapp account because what's the point of using 3 apps which function as same."
"While creating a Group OR while Adding group members.. now it becames difficult. After we search one word in contacts, unable to select multiple contacts at the time. It is going back after one contact select .. correct this..."
Do I upgraded my phone and all of a sudden whatsapp is having issues uploading video to my stories. It keeps saying if I keep seeing the issue to restart my phone we'll I have restarted it a couple times and the issue is still there.😑
"I'm unable to receive verification code by sms or phone call. Even after limit timer is over it's always showing you have guessed too many times. While i didn't guessed. Now what i do, I'm totally. They didn't reply my email as well."
"after updating the app the chat from which message has been delete ( delete for me) not going down.to old place..remains at the topmost position. And this is happening with all the chats... Means if I m deleting the message for myself , there is an option to undo message for a few seconds. After going back from the chats the chat from which I have deleted should return to it's previous time. But this is not happening. Chat is still at the top. Please confirm is this due to recent update?"
Stopped working 2 weeks ago. Constant error messages saying the microphone has an issue and the phone needs to be restarted. After resetting the phone and reinstalling WhatsApp- the issue is still there. Other call apps work perfectly fine
"Since the new update,its getting worser.Everytime I call,its automatic end even thought my phone not laggy or something.It just kept end.I also can't send song link or any other documents link. And when I take picture,it was zoomed. Im begging please fix the call issue..."
"After update my Samsung phone into android 13, My what's app screen go black during incoming calls. Its really very bad when I unlock and drop-down notification bar to check and receive calls. Please suggest any solution."
Overall I have a positive experience with this application as a god king these certain drawbacks are it's limited I wish I could do videos and such I know I can but sharing from platform to platform would be more beneficial. If you know what. Any who I digress be positive aspect is it's so fluid it's so open it's so sincere I have wonderful conversations with my mentor on this device through this application and through this I am able to heal and transcend myself so sincerely I say thank you. ET
"I am using what's app for many years, it was fine but now I am facing missed call problem in my both Vivo sets. Before, it rings an incoming call, I find two or three silent missed calls which are un noticed ,as the phone doesn't ring. Please suggest what is the solution."
"WhatsApp has now bece one of the great apps so far. It's making it easier to reach family and friends and also helps in the aspect of work. Try and add a section for broadcast lists so we can access our broadcasts easily rather than scrolling through many chats. I've rated it for stars because I don't understand why the community section was created. That section benefits only Administrators of groups, if you're not an admin in any of the groups on your phone then that aspect become useless."
"When opening a chat with 50 unread messages, can you please add a feature that lets me start reading at the at the last message I read. I can't be opening a chat of 100 messages and it skips all the other texts to show the latest one when there are 99 other unread messages. Something like what Telegram does"
"WhatsApp is free to download messenger app for smartphones. WhatsApp uses the internet to send messages, images, audio or video. The service is very similar to text messaging services, however, because WhatsApp uses the internet to send messages, the cost of using WhatsApp is significantly less than texting. You can also use Whatsapp on your desktop, simply go to the Whatsapp website and download it to Mac or Windows. It is popular with teenagers because of features like group chatting, voice"
"Used to be great but recently when I am in WhatsApp and try to add a photo from my library it doesn't show. It only shows photos from a week ago. I then have to go into album, choose the photo I want to send and then click send via whatsapp"
"When will your UI/UX Team work on not pinning the Archived Chats, on top of all the chats? It is really annoying whenever I see the archived chats being on top of all the chats. Think for yourself, if one has archived a chat forever, it is just for the sole reason of not seeing any of its presence, again. But with your current feature, the ""Archived"" chats option just comes on top of all the chats in WhatsApp. If I'd ever need to see any archived chat, I'd prefer to see it from somewhere else."
I haven't been able to trim pictures for a month are we solving this? Details: Selecting a pic from the preview in the builtin camera Trimming and clicking done hangs and the picture goes black Works when selecting it from attach->camera->gallery
"The latest update is horrible. When trying to attach a photo, it defaults to photos WITHIN whatsapp. What kinds of sense does that make?! Need to select the three dots at the top to get to my gallery."
"Screenshot feature should be disabled while viewing "" once view"" photos. Aparr from that , the app is just fine. Also , data backup feature doesn't work while roaming."
"It was very good but the last update doesn't let me open pictures that are to view one time only and it's literally giving me a headache right now. And this problem is only on one chat, with others it doesn't happen and also it always gives me the message that I have to update even though I already did that."
What'sapp has no idea how happy I am with this new update. I'm super impressed. Only thing left is the notification that pops up when you delete for everyone. I mean I'm deleting something because I didn't want the recipient to see it. Why notify them that I deleted something? Work on this and watsap will be perfect .
Good for messaging.... But after recent update backup function not working properly at all. It shows failed to take backup due to network issue after reaching 98. %.Developers please look into it
"For some reason the screen goes black whenever I try hearing the voice messages. Even when I keep it at full volume, I can barely hear the voice. Please fix this."
"Seems to be since the latest Android update I can no longer send recent photos via the paperclip option. I've checked media access and it all appears to be fine, but won't access anything from November 22 on my phone!"
"There are thousands problem with this app. If I'm gonna say those it would be morning to evening. So I'm just explaining my problem, first of all i deleted my whatsapp for take a break, now my rest has ended off therefore i decided to continue with whatsapp but when i tried to login with it, the OTP hadn't coming. I was like wddaheck mann!! Whats the problem it is. Thereafter i tried again and again but it didn't work at all. I call the customer care of Vodafone, i talked with them. Theresa's np"
Latest update for video calls is not good. Not liking it. If we minimize screen the call gets small angle changes and it feels like eyes have squint issue.. Previous outlook was far better that this new one.
"Only 2 things I wish whatsapp would change is to PLEASE give an option to not show you are currently online. It sucks when you are speaking to someone but not able at the time to respond to someone else and then get a message saying they see that you are online! Like I'm in a business conversation! Next it would be lovely to select who you want the ""read message"" on for like on imessage. Some people I want them to know I read their message where as others, not so much"
"Unpleasant start of 2023 Why is it that I'm not able to upload videos from my camera roll to status?????? Annoying prompt indicates that I must restart my phone if I keep seeing ""failure to upload video.."" Fix please!"
"Suddenly app doesn't want to open, but will open only when someone message .. u cN reply and app closed.. and this is all sudden.. well done.. don't invade privacy that mch that user can't even use the app"
After the recent update it has been constantly have the probelm of not showing one time video . You received a message but your version doesn't support it. I recently Updated the whatsapp then also no improvement please help me with the issue
"This last update brought something that I didn't particularly like, which was seeing status through the profile picture in the chat, I found it unnecessary and useless, in addition to being very disruptive."
"Please add a option where I can turn off video calls from others, so that they can't video call me. Also add a ""filter chat"" option for filtering read and unread messages, etc."
"I had problems lately with my SIM card, my phone didn't seem to detect it whatever i did, but of course mr. whatsapp doesn't care at all and already logged me out and wanted me to verify my number, now i changed my phone and bought a new SIM card, I really don't like this app and I'm only ""forced"" to re-install it because it's the only way i have ""currently"" to connect with my family."
This is a fabulous app for keeping in touch worldwide. Video and audio links as well as easy audo messaging has revolutitonized communication globally. It is incredibly easy to use and RELIABLE.
"WhatsApp is a very good app, on this we can talk to anyone and if we are not able to write, then we can also message someone by speaking, in this we can also show our photos to others, talk to anyone in any way. Can anyone wish someone a happy birthday can also send someone a photo of a dress How is it whether I should buy or not There is a lot to do in this People who have done evil on WhatsApp and gave very few stars Those people are bad."
"After the android 11 upgrade, don't know what's happening, can't download media (photos & videos) and not my settings, tried everything even clearing cache's restarting phone and still not working."
"The best messaging app ever. Actually u deserve all five stars but i gave u guys four b/cos of one thing and that is about sending video content. When i send or someone sends me a vidoe, the full video doesnt come but just 29 seconds of it goes or comes. So i think u should reconsider in ur next update to make sure full video is sent or recieved."
"I couldn't open WhatsApp today afternoon. That's why i had uninstalled & installed the app. I did the backup message & media. But , it's showing only conversation upto 17th December. conversation of after 17th to 28th are missing. How can I receive that? Please help me..!"
"This app is perfect for texting anyone! I would recommend it to 12+ though because you can get added to random groups without knowing. But still, a great app.😊"
It is a great place to use chat services. However I'm a bit annoyed with its privacy features. I don't want any random contact outside my contact list to message and call me but I don't have that settings. It becomes annoying to receive calls and messages on Whatsapp from random contacts. I hope there's a way to block this unnecessary traffic. Also I cannot report suspicious numbers.
"Whatsapp and I have a love/ hate relationship. After a while on a call, there is a loud heavy buzzing delayed echo of my voice that won't go away. This happens every single time. There are lots of other smaller glitches as well which make me want to throw my phone out of the window, such as a freeze on sending/recieving of messages where they don't go through with way. I can also hear noises in the background WAYYY louder than the person I'm speaking to. Please fix these long standing issues!"
"there's not enough features that I think it should have at this point since competition does: more variety in options to edit photos and videos, drawing, effects, etc"
"After the update, I can't seemed to download PDF documents on my phone. The customer support was pretty much useless telling me to change the settings on my phone which they were already set to what they've proposed. Am so done with their auto replies."
"One of the best app in the last 10 years. However the new updates messed up the settings, I am showing online for several minutes after I get out of the app. I clear the cache every time I get in the app, and I constantly delete messages and media, so I use only 467 mb memory. I don't understand what is goung on, Please fix the problem... weird!"
"Love the concept and features, but man is this app unreliable. Messages lag in delivery often for 10+ mins up to hours. Often have to switch to traditional messaging app, so why bother."
Also having issues attaching photos to messages. The last update messed with this and i now have to take ages to send multiple images to contacts or upload to my status. Such a pain! Please fix asap🤞🏼🤞🏼
"I find it really difficult to use video call (it always disconnects), especially when we call with Bluetooth earphones connected to the phone. Please fix the issue ASAP."
"One app that has seen a tremendous jump in its users as well as public interest in last decade. All in one , from sending photos to documents to anything you need. It's like a full on power package and a reliable application with security and privacy. Love the way , WhatsApp team is continuously working to bring great updates and features. the layout and user interface and every feature is improving with time and hoping for more in near future. We expect a lot now from this amazing team. ~SAN"
"So the problems is that when I call my friend my phone will turn black, even with video call and voice message, I can't even hear any voice message, my phone never experienced anything like this before so please fix this and thank you."
"Dear Team, In the next update Please give us an option to edit our status caption after it being get displayed to everyone..! It can be very helpful to correct the spelling mistakes. With this feature many people can escape from embarassment, insults and funny comments from others. Even Facebook and Instagram have this feature nowadays.After seeing my friend (Victim-பாதிக்கப்பட்டவர்)😂😂 scenario, I am raising this query, as a kind advice to the team..Jai Hind..!"
"Since September 2021, WhatsApp allows businesses to send WhatsApp promotional messages to users who have opted-in. Businesses can now send discount vouchers, promotional offers, coupons, product launch updates, alerts & more on WhatsApp. That's some fantastic news for all Businesses using WhatsApp Business API. Sending promotional messages is the best way to do bulk WhatsApp Marketing! But, you shouldn't send promotional messages on WhatsApp just because you can. There are 3 things you m"
Terrible (Facebook) privacy policy. Hope you don't mind when they sell your private information to your employer. Also their parent company shut off access to emergency services when Australia legislated against then. Despicable. Only app that requires local sharing (insecure) and Google play services (also insecure). Ive been unable to upload my backup becausr they only accept it if you give them full access to your google account. A shameful company.
"being the most widely used application for the online messaging, I have had a great experience with whatsapp. Continuous updates are making whatsapp more easy to use. Now it has become a part of life for billions of people across the globe. Thankyou team whatsapp:)"
Very bad service and help services is too ... My voice recorder is not working in my phone whenever I try to voice record the sound became horrible and very wierd... But in video recording the voice is very smooth and good why in (jio phone next) the WhatsApp is not working
"Good app, but lately I've had a really bad experience Once a day I get the problem that it's backing up messages, while I turned off the backup a long time ago. While the backing up I'm not able to use whatsapp or any other app Recently the minimization of a video call doesn't work anymore: if I am video calling and want to use a different app, it turns off my camera and I can't see the other person anymore. I hope you get to fix this, it would really make the experience a lot better."
I can't send status reply in landscape mode there is no option for sending and no suggestions like emojis as they are in normal potrait mode.As I rotate I can send . Before updating my WhatsApp app I could send and used in landscape mode since I installed WhatsApp app .But After Update can't send status reply.
"After the new updates, we can select multiple image files from gallery to send. This is really annoying. Could you guys please fix this one as early you can. Thank you."
"Wonderful app but the sync with WebWhatsapp is pathetic. So many missing messages on laptop, even from 1,2 or 3 days ago. That should not happen. This is going on since at least a few weeks. Please fix this bug ASAP."
"WhatsApp web scanning not working properly, WhatsApp camera not focusing on this realme smartphone. There is a bug in driver or something like that especially for WhatsApp Web cam. Because if we take back step to the phone camera app then again back to the WhatsApp web scan camera, then it's focusing the QR code."
No issues but adding a feature for live profile pictures would be nice. Like being able to have a 5 second video as your display photo.
I like this app and all. But only problem is that whenever I try to call somebody. It lasts for a while but it kicks me out of the call and makes me leave on my own for no reason. So if u could fix it then thanks
When it comes to whatsapp the first thing that hits our mind is our privacy that the WhatsApp tried to provide. However in my opinion there should be an option for hiding your contact number from others. I am not an expert but there should be a kind of link used instead of the phone number to add someone who had hidden his phone number in whatsapp using that feature.... 🤔I think it would be awesome...
"WhatsApp is a great app. It's really helpful for chat... I would like to recommend some of your updates, WhatsApp. You can update your figures like ""If someone change their profile picture"" you can update us...As example : Tap to view JR Profile Picture. And WhatsApp can tell us who is in online in our contact. Example: JR is on online. Something like this...So it is easy to know...I hope you will accept my suggestion. Thanks 🙏."
"After updating this apps, I cannot send multiple pictures at the same time. When try to attach photos, the gallery that comes out are not the same from my phone gallery. Please fix this"
"Its a good app i suppose, but the one function that an admin have which is ""to delete other ppls messages"" is rlly irritating, although it may be because of the ppl i text but nonetheless i dont think they should have this function! Everytime i send something (not mean or bad just a normal happy picture or kind msg) it gets deleted, when asked, its just for fun! Its completely annoying i dislike that feature alot"
One ★ reduced → Archive chat shows on top. It should be at the bottom. Second ★ reduced → even after clicking for selected contacts (either profile or about or online status) still it shows people outside the selected contacts☹️ please fix this ASAP..
"I enjoy this app but if I make a mistake while typing, and the message is already sent, there is no option to edit the message. If the mistake is huge, I'll have to delete the message which is upsetting. Also, I can't save statuses or download pics and videos from statuses."
"This app, like Facebook, just loves to require access to your data before letting you use. I cannot initiate a conversation with anyone (even if I want to do it with a phone number or account name) until you give full access to your contacts to this app. This is a nightmare app if you care about your privacy at all."
"In Last few weaks when make a call, opposite person ""can't hear my voice"" or some time automatically shows 'RECONNECTING'. It's disturbing to call. Kindly do something to clear this problem."
"Really good application. I've been using it since years. No problems at all uptil now. For some reason I'm not able to shar my live location with anyone even though the app permision for ""Location access"" is enabled."
It's like the app is now to large for its own good. The video and audio calls are the worst. At the slightest network glitch it goes from bad to worse and stays there.
"I have been using your app, ever since I became attached to using, smartphones and other digital experience devices. I'm impressed, with the many communicating ways, Whatsapp gives you as an option, to use. Thank you Whatsapp. I've been learning so much, using your app. Thank you."
"New update on Samsung s22 and now I can't send any videos on here as when I click my gallery it goes to WhatsApp gallery automatically, then when I click into my phone gallery it only shows photos and not videos! Rubbish!"
I cannot use Bluetooth headphones with whatsapp. I have android 11 and there is no option to add nearby devices in the permission setting. Other apps like skype have no problem.
"Absolutely Rubbish I want to restore my old chat, but I can't change my password, after it keeps telling me it's incorrect, and then locking my out for ages. When I got to the ""help"" option, it gives you directions that aren't possible or even available. Need to contact them? Nope there's no way to do that either. Why can't you just let me change my password the way all other apps do?"
"This app reduced picture quality a lot... It's tiring that you don't get the exact picture quality sent ..... The picture quality should be improved... Posting pictures on the status is also tiring due to low quality.. And now, links can't be accessed through this app"
Since last updated video and normall calls drop out and an error message putting the blame on the microphone. The microphone works fine with all other apps that use it. I'm using an S21 Ultra.
The 16th November update has screwed up the gallery function. When you want to add pictures from your gallery it cannot see pictures you have already taken. You have to come out of WhatsApp and go to your picture gallery. Select the picture and share. Then select WhatsApp as the medium. Extremely frustrating
The app is really good but after the last update this app having issues receiving and sending the videos... While receiving the videos app always hang.. Please fix this bug as soon as possible. Thank you
"WhatsApp sucks, it has the same interface since its launch. Many errors, bugs, not very good implementations. So that's when I ask myself: What is this? It is supposed to be a messaging app, but it is the opposite."
"The new Status upgrade making text small is great but I think it will be better if there should be (left align text, center align text and right align text) just for someone to be able to customize how it would look"
Now I'm facing so much problem with WhatsApp bugs. I can't able to do a video also. Video call cuts automatically when I'm in the video call & WhatsApp is not working properly after the recent update. Please fix the bug.
Usually really useful but the latest update as everyone else as mentioned about the gallery. Needs to go back how it was. I'm tempted to use something else altogether if it stays the same - it's super inconvenient.
"Tips for using Switch Access After you set up Switch Access, use these tips to get started. Basic navigation If you use auto-scanning If you use step scanning If you use group selection Global menu While you scan your screen, select the Menu button to open a global menu with navigation options: Back: Go back to the previous page or hide the keyboard if a keyboard is visible.  Home: Go to the Home screen. Overview: Show recently opened apps. Notifications: Open the notifications shade."
Really good. The only problem: how come you can't access your number??? I mean it's kind of an obvious thing. You don't always remember your phone number. Turns out there is absolutely no way to access your phone number... on your phone. Not on WhatsApp nor Messages... annoying. You should also have the option to appear offline / online if you don't want others to know you're online.
"Cannot add contacts, send messages, or make calls. App asks for permissions but not a single feature will function. Absolute waste of time."
Whatsapp is a good application to talk to someone. I just want a change in this that there should be a option of adding song in video or photo. It will be very helpful for the users and this thing will also attract users to use the whatsapp more.
The upgrade is nice but can you help us work on being able to click a particular status by just a simple touch and not having to view all other unnecessary one just because we want to view one. Thank you
"Whatsapp suddently come out error message and ask for restoration. Then stuck there. Because of that, I have to uninstall and reinstall the apps in order to get my data back through restore from back up in google drive. Unfortunately, my afford is failed and loses all my chat history."
Thanks to you for providing amazing features through WhatsApp recently WhatsApp has introduced a new feature called poll which has four options to select but otherwise it is possible to select only one of the selected items so as to get specific answers to the above questions for example which item is selected all the other items It would be nice to disable please by doing so we will be able to use this facility transparently thanks
"I love the app.To me it's working perfectly. Expecially the newly added power of admin to delete offensive posts. I am suggesting of adding another new innovation. For the user to be able SORT posts. Where individual can divide the posts to different segments like 4 or more like news,social, religion etc. According to individual interest .Thanks."
The new feature somehow is very annoying. When you delete certain messages from particular date from someone's chat. The chat still shows in the list irrespective of deleting certain messages.
Suddenly my whatsapp crash and its initialise automatically. After I see there no single messages. I saved some important message personally how can I backup that message. And worst thing is backup also doesn't work.
"17-11-2022 Update... and still no reply or change to the app. October 2021: When will you fix it so media is automatically located on external storage? I'm always having to clear stuff from internal storage just so I can use my phone! Please pay this some attention, it's becoming a deal breaker for me and my family."
"Finally, the ability to turn off online status. Used to drive me nuts when people I don't want to talk to see me online and message. One helpful addition will be the ability to block certain contacts from calling only. They can message all they want but just don't call me. That will be beautiful! 😍"
I have not been able to send a voice note for the past year. I spend the long time recording only for nothing to have been recorded. Please take a look and correct this issue. I use a Nokia 6 phone.
"After the recent update, even if you delete a message, that chat box still remains on top. It should go down to time or date as per the last received undeleted message. Kindly make this change as it was earlier before the update."
Update: idk messages on my phone whatsapp is not updated. I get new messages on web ver but none on my phone. This is weird. I have no clue how to fix this. I tried clearing my cache but nothing happened. The latest poll update is weird. Why do I can vote to all choices? I hope you can fix this to only one choices.
"WhatsApp was working fine until recently, messages don't always send they just stay on one tick which has been really awful during emergencies, calls also don't always go through anymore, happens very often and I know it is not my WiFi that is the problem, app needs to be fixed"
"Dear whatsapp, I liked the app but there is only 1 problem that is ""if you gave the option to delete the message for everyone then why did you allow the receiver to see 'This message was deleted'. What's point to delete the message then? As being a sender i don't want the receiver to see that line or even getting the idea and tell me why doesn't your 'delete for everyone' option include me. I'm also the part of everyone, i guess. Why did you give the separate option of 'delete for me'?""."
"Just got aslower and harder to use, changes for the sake of changing something. Switching linked devices now takes forever. Can no longer copy multiple lines of chat (why?!?! Why would anyone think that that is an improvement ffs? The pc version now fails to update the chat and just hangs. Why? Who had these bright ideeas? Makesure you promote him to the unemployment office. App is now worse. I fail to see any improvement, but plenty of new issues. The thing was working fine, not anymore. Gg"
"Please please please fix this bug that's logging out Android users. There's no verification code being sent. When i opt for the 'Call me' it says I've tried for a code too many time and to try again after one hour. But every hour when i go back, it just tells that to me again and resets the 1hr timer. Please just fix it!!"
WhatsApp has been a great app to use over the years. But suddenly I can no longer send voicenotes. They record badly and no one can make out what I am saying over the breaking up of my voice. It is a disaster and very inconvenient. Please fix this bug. I dont know if anyone else is struggling with this issue.
"Good app, but what I dislike the most is that anyone who gets hold of your phone number can see that you have Whatsapp installed. It needs to change. If anyone wants to add you, the invitation should go through text message and only after you accept they should be able to see you on whatsapp. Also under privacy settings for last see, photo, and about, there should be an option for 'Only these contacts' so that any new contact you add will not automatically see it unless you include them."
"I don't know with how much importance will my review be taken into consideration. But still being a user of whataspp I want some changes to be done in future. Just as none can deny the importance of small things to make a big one, being a tiny particle in the midst of numerous users I would like to say to whatsapp that please increase the status's duration to 45 or 50 second. It is currently of 30 second. But I think most of the users face trouble while uploading any video that is over 30 second"
WhatsApp is becoming better but if it is like instagram it will be the best because if we want change the msgs to another phone it is a very big process and when I am changing all the msgs where lost i have backed up but it is not came and about poll is very good feature but one can vote in every poll that's not nice pls correct that one can only vote in one option
"Please u need to update the pop-up notification, I'm being told it's not available on my Android version meanwhile I checked my Android settings and it's intact. You also need to update the viewing of status from the display picture icon for Androids too because it's available on iPhone. And we should be able to pin our favorite status so it would remain there after 24 hours. I hope you will work on this immediately. Thank you"
"The last update is more annoying, I cannot see the recent picture when I try to send them, and even when I open the Gallery I couldn't select more than 1 picture or video Something needs to be fixed asap"
"Now, if I came to change the number that I am registered with on the application, any messages between me and anyone that appear on the new number and the groups that I join, the old number will be replaced with the new one, and this annoys me very much and makes me prefer to use other applications such as Telegram I hope that you will make this optional and not obligatory"
"The app is great but there's been something that has been bothering me for a while now, anytime a friend is offline and I send them a text it doesn't deliver. Minutes later they come online it then delivers. Almost like you have to be online for a text to pop up, I don't understand that. Can you fix that? Maybe it's a bug."
The update is not that bad but it had lots of issues Viewing status is now annoying. I can be viewing the next one and the previous is still playing. I can chat and the sound is still playing. If I open a group chat it takes me to the last message and I can't continue from where I stopped. Lastly the quality of pics and videos are just too low
"It is better to have random button on poll now its having an check box, it leads to genuine voting ,Now there having an Double voting. Double Voting system may not be have an perfect result. So please improve it.!"
"I like that green rim around the profile pic when the contact adds a status update. It would be great to have it half green if the contact is online, half red if offline. You can even split in for segments and apply other options!"
"One of the most annoying bugs..every time I'm sending a video or audio file, it uploads 100% and then, it starts uploading again from 0% to 100%, over and over. It happens couple of times before it is sent finally. Waste of time, waste of data and that annoyance.. It's been happening for more than a year..."
"1)When posting a video on status, the video sometimes is not sync with its own sound which is very annoying. 2)When I select a large video for my status, it takes alot of time before loading. it's very borring please try fixing that. Maybe the app is trying to compress it. 3)Adding a way to separate group chats from other conversations will make the chat page less choked when there are many messages. Please try fixing it."
"This app was okay until the update I don't see notifications until I open the app and sometimes I don't see statuses even when they are it won't show honestly this app is trash with this update that's why I gave one star please fix so it'll be enjoyable again for everyone,I also can't see when people are online and not please fix that too cause it's really annoying"
Voice call is blocked with the new update installed. Now only video call is possible. Voice call automatically stopped after 30 seconds. It is a big bug in update. Before update it was ok. Please remove this update.
It would be better if there was a watsapp reminder feature so i can write it to someone or a group and they could get notifications of it. And when we send multiple pictures the first one chosen must go first even if the picture needs more data to transfer still it should be sent first
"The latest software update is HORRIBLE, to say the least!! The gallery is a total mess. Who has the time to send one picture at a time ??? Bring back the previous version, it was way better!!"
This is a great app to chat with frinds etc. And I've been using it for quite a lot every day. Why only 3 Stars? Well lately it was very buggy and the message i send appeared late but i had a good connection to the internet. It would be great if the whatsapp team fixes this problem.
That last update has made it extremely hard to send pictures. You can't select multiple photos anymore. Just 1 at a time. Fix your app!!
"I suddenly lost all my data in WhatsApp this morning including chats,pics, gifs, videos ; It popped a notification of restore the data, but when I clicked on restore, it was unable to restore my data(I tried twice), then I clicked on skip, and ahhh!!!! Unfortunately all my data got lost . Please do something and restore all my data 🙏"
"I have two issues with this application. 1. Having a ""view once"" option that allows screenshot and screen-record of the should be private content, is like buying a safe and writing the unlock code on top of it for everyone to access. That is, it is useless! 2. Giving people a ""delete for all"" option and then going ahead to announce to the other party that the message has been deleted is rather pretentious. Why not do what Instagram does with the ""unsend"" option??"
"After the most recent update, every time the app is not visibly open on my phone, notifications would not come in until I open the app and everything shows up I've checked background data settings on my phone and everything is intact, this has happened to me twice and always after an update. I really hope this could be fixed immediately. It's very disturbing"
"Why is it so hard to send image via whatsapp? Why is it I disable notification from phone settings and the ring still on, even though there is no notification shown that there is a call? Care to tell me?"
"Quite recently, I'm facing an issue with the Online Status of my contacts. If I'm chatting with a friend, they are NOT shown online but as soon as they start typing, the typing status is shown. Same is true for recording audios. Problem is only with the Online status. Why is that happening? Kindly resolve this issue and I'll update my review to 5 stars. Thanks!"
"App is good, but you have to include one more feature, i.e., member of a group should be able to select who all can see the message sent by him. I hope you will include this feature. Thank you."
"It is very nice app. We can send anything from our smartphone like any image, video, screen recorder very easily. The festival wishes also. This app is very helpful to our states. Thank you Regards Sahil"
"Learn from your competitions. Especially from telegram app. For instance, you can't edit your own message without deletig. Even though you delete it, a message ""deleted"" remains. Besides, you should also work on the function of sending different files. You can't also edit photos or videos when you're sending. Long story short, just use telegram app, learn their functions and add to yours. You'll make all your WhatsApp users HAPPY with this. You're a lot behind them for now. Catch up with them!"
The app is really good! But can you please add for colours for the theme (please add baby pink i love that colour) also more fonts. (Sorry if I'm asking too much but this types of features are really rare.)
I love using this I had issues will sending staus because its limit is only of 30 second and i have crop my vedios over 5 to 8 to fully send it I request to extend its timelinit up 1 minute only I will be grateful if you do this and rest functions of this app are awesome looking for a nice change and a few more upgrades. Tank you
"After the update i can no longer share screenshots from my phone on whatsapp. The folder isnt showing anymore when i try to send photos, and ss do not appear even when I press the camera key to send recent photos."
Wonderful app. Easy to use .Reliable and very cheap for conference voice calls. Feature I would like to see upgraded :- number of participants for both the video and voice conference calls.
"I have good experience in using this application it is a best massaging and photo but I think audio recording and video calling recording fracture should be add in it while calling . Major issues faced is after the recent update video calls automatically stop s while talking .The app was working fine until the recent update .when you call a person via bluetooth headset,it connects your call to the receiver.Although you are upgrading it and adding some of the advance fracture."
"Recently just hasn't been sending messages. WiFi and Data are all working and on. Every other form of messaging works, just not this one. Very annoying"
Lemme give out two starts for the flowing reason ....the app doesn't show if sameone is online and it doesn't have a place to download status ...and for business matter it doesn't support same trade links !!! So they should improve a bit and and more features to distinguish it from being simple
"I have a backup stored in google drive and I can browse in google drive and see the file But after uninstalling and installing, whatsapp is saying ""no backup found"" and I'm sure its the same account and the same number , I lost all my data and I can't back it up"
"It's been years since they've broke the fetch thumbnail function when sharing a URL. Broken on WhatsApp web as well. Going downhill ever since taken over by Meta. 2 updates since the issue, and still not fixed."
"Not receiving notifications, especially on WhatsApp and other apps, more than slow. everything has been blocked, since 31st August -2022 I couldn't make messeging contact or calling with either my direct family, relatives and friends. Retrieve my WhatsApp. I will make direct calling to the family to know what happened to them."
"Hey, Please add customised presets in (status privacy->olny share with). One should use preseted custom 2-3 groups likeschool friends, college frends, office staff, etc. When I want to show status to some perticular persons, I need to tick the persons every time in olny share with option. It will be easy if I have already pre-sets of particular groups, only I want to share."
"It's disturbing when one notice a typographical error on Whatsapp status, and without an edit option on it. It would help, if you provide an edit option, like that of Facebook."
WhatsApp is a great way to communicate but it all comes down to when u start voice or video calls and your on WiFi but when your off WiFi and using your data it's perfectly fine. But when you use WiFi it always crashes and WhatsApp is down for no less than 2 hours. It's a joke!!! It's not just my WiFi or my phone either. I have tried multiple phones and WiFi and it still dose the same thing. I would not recommend this as most people like to call instead of text each other.
"The app is good. But uninstwalled and instwalling time,i faced my backup restoring problem. These issue i shared whatsapp helpcenter mail. But the serviece is too bad. I'm waiting for their correct reply for their giving solution. But not correcting still. This is a bad facing of whatsapp."
"Super fast and easy to use. I can easily share photos and videos from gallery and backups saved all my memories and i didn't lost anything.Also i can choose friends that i want to share status with them,the status privacy is very helpful."
"It's alright but I find it odd that accounts are easily Hacked and nothing is really being done about it, I got a text with a code about using a different device the other day. Can't seem to report on the app only on here, friends have lost access to their WhatsApp accounts. Other than that it's a decent app"
"It would be good if you could do something with the poll because when we touch ""View Poll"" , the screen goes back to home of watsapp where all chats appear. Please fix that. Otherwose everything is perfect for me."
"When a person makes a group , then all numbers in the group get visible to all members present in the group, due to which unnecessarily numbers get shared with other people. Numbers should only be visible to group admin and not to the members in the group. Also allow us to delete for all in broadcast, if something gets broadcast by mistake."
I just love this app until the recent update. Every time I pick a video call there are breakages and I don't hear anything even with stable Internet connection. I guess there should be an improvement
"Terrible, sending media has become a NIGHTMARE and the app crashes when I even try to edit the picture I want to send! There's no quick access to latest pictures! FIX IT!"
"It was good to use, I would like it more if they could arrange some options to organise groups and contacts related to a topic as a folder on one end, for easy usage."
"It is a best messaging and photo , video sharing software. But I think audio recording and video calling recording feature should be add in it while calling.although you all are upgrading it and adding some of the advance feature. Keep upgrading by which a user could get a better experience and don't face any types of problems while using it. I would like to thank all of your team members of the company who are doing hardwork with honesty 🙏 . Still My experience is good to use it. 🇮🇳"
This app is very good but I have only one problem that I have deleted certain images yet those are able to be seen by me and if i try to open it it says the file is not supported. Please look for it because i don't want the deleted images to be appeared. Thankyou
"I truly love how much whatsapp has grown over the years. So far it has never failed me. I only have 1 issue though. When group member speak in another language I often have to go and search what they're talking about so if the next update can include a language translation for groups, that would be very awesome."
Can WhatsApp explain the inexplicable reason why there is a feature to invite LANDLINE contacts on my phone to join WhatsApp? What a stupid feature apart from having to scroll past to reach the contacts that are MOBILE numbers. A green dot notification on a green background for incoming messages is a real plus.
"What have you done!? My camera photos don't show up in the normal media section when sending a photo, when I click on the 3 dots in top right corner to get into camara photos I can only send one photo at a time....what's that all about?? Get it sorted"
everyday new features are making whatsapp super cool. I like one more feature i.e. i should be able to select who can see my profile photo. By default profile photo and my contact info should not be visible to new contacts unless i give access. Thanks.
"WhatsApp is one of thee most popular messaging apps to have it is a quick go to app and reliable, although I would like it if the quality of a screenshot not to be decreased and not to be made blurry,and kept at it's high quality screenshot. Also when wanting to post on your story that we be able to select from our albums instead of having scroll through everything. The text story , it'd be nice if new background colours could be added."
The security of the app is trach and from my experience with WA I found a middle page that interfere with my sent and received data. Thus it's mandatory to have a second thought on information exposed to such platform.
Kindly consider working on this. What's photos are never clear. Photos do loss it's quality. 2. Is it possible to have chats and groups separated. 3. Can we have more themes available for one to be able to choose what's working for them.
It's a nice app for messaging and stuff. It has perfected messaging as we know it. They should add a search feature so we can search for those who check my status instead of scrolling to look for names
"Can we have a sketch pad feature so we can draw a quick diagram/drawing on a canvas to send to the chat? Chat >> paperclip >> Sketch. Then some basic tools and colours, and a blank canvas half the screen."
The latest update is sh**....not able to select multiple photos in one go to share from gallery...have to go through the three dots to switch to camera gallery everytime and select a single photo and repeat the process again and again till i reach 30 pics limit
Samsung update means you have to physically go into gallery to share photos whereas last week you could attach them from inside whatsapp itself. It still works for videos just not pics. Really annoying.
Kindly remove the feature of message removal by admin. People have been using this feature in a negative way and communication is becoming quite difficult. Would really appreciate it if you guys could find a fix to it.
"It's a good app . Easily chating, calling, video calling, voice message.it's so cool. And there are groups . I have alot of groups like family, friends . It sticks everyone together . We can do video call in groups . it's so fun.cool stickers and gifs, and more chilling features. Video callings are so funny. It's latest features is pay through WhatsApp I guess it's so cool this helps everyone , and there is one more feature that is community. I recommend everyone to download this fantastic app"
"I keep getting messages from fake business and scammers, I keep blocking and reporting however it still happens every day. This app does nothing when you report scammer. Also can't use it on multiple devices I have a tablet very annoying I can't use it on both."
Havving issues with my Samsung S22 Ultra. Difficult to access my phone's gallery as WhatsApp prioritises its own image folders. I also cannot select multiple images to share. Please fix these bugs!
"After recent updates bugs are found in the app ,while video calling the app not responding properly,it's getting stuck and eventually getting closed ,also the additional feature of pic blur in chat section is irritating, please give option to modify according to user convience,rest everything is fine love this app"
"Not bad could use more parts like added options for maps, the site is made for those who are basically looking for a mate for one reason or other and to have a two way GPS would be a nice addition"
"I love WA but lately, I would dare say already months, I don't get any notifications unless I am right in the app. Calls are simply not ringing and often noticed after couple of hours like a ""missed call notifications""! It's very very inconvenient and I would vote for some fixing before I will be forced to swap my favourite chatting and calling tool. Thanks for taking into consideration!"
"Pretty nice, but I would like the developers to enable the delete functions for admins to delete messages that are not needful in a group chats from other members view to avoid group interruption. Thanks plz you guys have done a good job. Also the developers should include online notifier for all contacts, not necessarily when you open one chat page before you can see if a person is online or not, but once you open your WhatsApp page it should notify like FB messenger does. Thank you"
"Thanks for developing this app. We completely rely on this app for communication. But it would be better if u consider a few things.. +A feature that does not bring the archived chat up on the top whenever a new mssg arrives from that chat. +Also, please add a feature to tag people on whatsapp status + Strikethrough feature for 'About'"
"Good experience overall but whenever I receive messages from multiple users, the app icon disappears until I lock my phone screen. This only happens with WhatsApp."
"Respected developer, I am very benefited by downloading this app of yours. But I want you to increase the privacy of this app a bit more. My humble request, you arrange separate pin for each contact in next update. I am having a hard time not having this feature. I hope you see this issue. Please 🙏"
"I am using this app since very long, but i am facing this problem for the very first time, it's not opening, it's is showing that WhatsApp have bug, and update when developer fixes that. I don't know why it's happening, i have reinstalled app, but then also problem remains same showing that it has some bug."
"Have been my first choice of text msg apps but recently constantly running in the background for backup and draining the battery despite amending the setting, not sure why, hopefully will not be like this after latest update."
"I like to use this app it is very helpful to make friends all over the world, and I also use whatsapp for work as well. but the only one thing need to be update, online status.. sometimes when I am not online my friend says that I am online. please work on that thankyou.. but still overall this app is the best!!"
"I logged out my whatsapp, and now i can't log in my whatsapp..it strucks in initailizing part..while i gave my name and setting my profile the initializing starts and it shows ""unable to connect please try again"" And shows two options ""cancel"" And ""check status"" While i check status it gives a message like whatsapp working normally..please make sure of this problem.."
"Can you believe this still cant be used on an ipad? Maybe need to jailbreak but need cross platform. This app is not practical. What a backward thinking app..... When is this app going to work properly across the different platforms? I fear the third party apps are a security issue, but no one has any choice. If you think this app and its chat platform is secure, maybe its time to think again because lots of people now use third party apps to access this platform. A disgrace entirely...."
"The worst app ever created, but has many users around the world. The security is very critical. 2FA is not fully secure. They claimed secure. It's just a deception. Note: Never use the one-time-used number for this service or you say goodbye to it almost every single day."
"I like this App, but I feel disappointed when I try to insert my Sim to another phone, and this App seems to be ""Fussy"", when it keeps Verifying the number or the phone unit. Sometimes I need to wait 14 hours and even more to verify my existing number in that new phone. Means, I missed out of using Whatsapp for long hours."
"Pathetic, idk why whatsapp has become so worst, earlier we were able to easily restore backed up chat and media , now i just uninstalled the app and reinstalled and only chat is getting restored even though when i had done all the types of backup local and cloud and for an email only automated responses are coming through never expected, i have been using WhatsApp from more than decade never faced this issue"
Every app has pros and cons...that doesn't mean it is not beneficial for us....we should be more focused on advantages rather than negative aspects....so thanks for making something new...not really perfect but obviously unique.....
"Please remove 'Invite a friend' list from below the Friends list. It's a waste off time because if a person wants to, or does use WhatsApp, then as soon as I enter their details they will turn up on my WhatsApp friends list. I think your just scratching around for features to keep people using this app when it's reliability is failing its users? Never should have been 'given' to greedy Zuckerberg 😡🖕 Also, please remove Businesses from Discover section in Select contact page, complete waste. 😡"
"New update is extremely bad. Whenever update status (in case of text, words, typing). It becomes short. Why we have full screen ? If the size becomes too small. 🤮😡😠"
"Would be a much better app if export chat feature worked like telegram...If one could transfer data and chat history from one whatsapp account to another or one chat to other easily such that old and new chat messages are arranged according to time of posting, not in text file format. Add option to move selected chats from one account to other notifying only those contacts, the change in account number."
I had a high rating until i updated whats app and it asked for my passcode. I on pressed i forgot pass code. No code was sent to email or messenge box. A page come up next to go to chat......how can you go to chat when you can't get in to the app. I had no alternative to but skip resture and loose all data just to get inthe app all because i was unable retrieve passcode . No support They just repeated what i told them i could not do.i got a person from computer sciences they could not follow
"Its good and great. But u need to enhance a video zooming feature, where by a person can zoom in video while watching it like in Telegram. And please make it possible for people to be mentioning/tagging their friends at their status/story section. It'd help alot for those friends to realize and notice the statuses made for them to react on time. Thank you."
Day by day this whatsapp is improving and has been installed almost by everyone. One thing I want to notify to developers is please bring a feature where we can automatically block similar pattern of numbers automatically or scam calls or texts. I have become fed up from getting these fake text and calls. If this feature will be premium I would pay for it to get activated. Thanks
"My experience has on the app has been worthwhile and I love it, I hope to keep loving it!. The only problem with the app is that it needs to maintain quality of pictures and videos after it has been sent ."
"Nice Till Recent Update Reason below: WhatsApp is one to one messaging app, whoever contact is saved in ur device, will be able to contact you, there is no point of removing online status symbol from WhatsApp, it is not Facebook where anyone can message you by name. Even if you want not to be contacted just delete that person contact simple.. it is only female dominated feature."
"Very bad experience, even if I delete the contacts.. but still it shows on whatsapp and nothing can be done. I have refreshed, installed, unistalled and everything. But nothing works. Please do see to this issue"
"As a messenger it is good but the whatsapp payment is awfully buggy. One of my friends sent me a link for setting up WhatsApp payment & in the last 48 hours I have received more than 60 automatic reminders for the same. Even after setting up WhatsApp payment , sending & receiving money I am getting continues reminders for setting up WhatsApp payment."
"I've been using this app for 5 years now. The app is great but I recently switched phones and every time I'm trying to download the app, it continuously says ""pending."" It does not download. It has been pending for a week now."
"The recent update doesn't allow you to find recent photos, only showing photos in your WhatsApp folder. This needs to be reverted back to the original set up."
"I love this app it helps a lot nothing is bugging no ads it's very good you can join a group call we'll only if you have there number video call so you can see how family,friends over years ,(or for no reason at all) it great I love I contact my friend and I use it everyday (well not everyday) but I recommend you to download that app cuz it amazing."
"Good alternative for Messages, so you can chat cross platform, with read receipts, stickers, and actually somewhat decent quality video. Some changes would be suggested though. Most important feature missing, can't be singed in on two phones (or a phone and tablet) at once, unlike ¡Message. Also could better image and video quality shared."
"With this app , distance chatting is much better! But I don't know why the simplicity of this app is disappearing... With the latest version and its new feature, things are now a way more difficult than before... Lastly I tried to send more than 15 pictures to a contact,but each time I tried ,it was to no avail... meanwhile ,in the past I didn't face this challenge I'm really disappointed, though I like rhus app very much."
"Very convenient, to send text, pic, video to anyone and anywhere in the world at anytime Have connected with friends ,relatives and acquaintances, have used it for office work too"
Gmail don't give notification for my mails even after the all notification settings of Gmail app and system settings are on. Also my mails also not quickly visible to me unless I refresh it 2-3 times. This problem is faced not only by me but also hundreds of my friends. Please take this review seriously and do some real action on it as well as optimization of app instead of giving dump replies like follow blah blah.. site and follow that FAQ steps to solve your problem.
"The only flaw that kept me one star away is the lack of features and optimisations in camera settings. Auto focus doesn't work properly, quality often gets worse. Camera in WhatsApp is need to be upgraded."
I hate this new interface to send pictures or videos. How do you revert to the old way? It is impossible to find screenshots using this new method and it also feels more difficult to find what you are looking for!
"Very good app for recieving videos, sending videos, video chat, text, call etc. been using for about six months and i have had no issues or complaints definitely worth the download."
the long press on the app icon shows the most frequently contacted details. i do not like this feature and i learnt this feature cannot be disabled as of now. i hope they change it...
"I want to give u some suggestions.  You guys just got a new poll feature out. Similarly, you can also add new feature like a reminder. As in big companies the employees have to be reminded again and again. An alarm should be set in the group so that this work does not happen again and again. Same type as the alarm works. If you are interested in my suggestions, then I can explain to you in full details."
Latest version and before that version of the what's up working very worst. Too much hang problem in the video and audio call. There is no proper response from the support team as well.
"Wonderful... Just wonderful I love all these new features They're too exceptional... Keep it up guys Though I think there should be one minor change... I think you should be able to at least see how many people have viewed your status Even though you turned off the read receipts... Please if you could try to do something on this, I'd really appreciate 🙏🏾"
"The latest update has unmuted the group chats. Even after setting it on mute, the notification rings. Please fix it, as it destroys the very purpose of providing a muting option."
"Hi..I using this app to connect with everyone i need. I like the features in this app. This app is also develop, better time to time. But, I don't like green a bit. Can you make a feature so that this application can change colors according to what each user wants? Thank you ^^"
"“Waiting for this message. Check your phone- Many a time appearing of sender no., while showing me that all data are send perfectly. Kind resolve this issue. Otherwise this is cool gadget."
"It always worked well, but since the last update, sending pics/videos has been so difficult, bring it back like it was few months earlier pls, easy and simply to use."
"Recently, I am getting temporary banned unnecessarily, saying that I use unofficial version. I have been using the official version of WhatsApp since day 1 and haven't done any scraping or third party stuff using WhatsApp account. It is very annoying to just get banned for literally no reason, and I am not getting any support so that atleast I can know what's wrong."
"First suggestion The icon that appears in the WhatsApp community does not see the photo outside, you should update it and see the photo because most of the community groups have been formed without photo confusion. The second suggestion is that along with being a group add in the WhatsApp community, it should also be added to the broadcast list."
What happened? I used to enjoy using this app as my primary messenger app but now... I'm no longer am able to send more than one picture at a time and its a pain to even access my gallery from the app. HORRIBLE! I will be changing to a different app now because sharing pictures was essential for me.
"Worst app ever published on Play Store... Like I was on call with my friend in UK and more than half of the tym call was reconnecting, even we both had super stable networks... Snapchat is far better than WhatsApp.. even if someone ran out of data , Snapchat calls are smooth even on 144kbps , I have one good tip for WhatsApp, shutdown your servers and take a leave and enjoy (for lifetime) bcuz all features are copied from different apps , and atlast don't forget about your father (Telegram)✌️☮️"
"Is not clear where my data is stored. Does not provide a history log of past logins. Lost half of my chat history when moving to a new phone. Do not recommend, Jami or Tox work so much better and more reliable."
I think the whatsapp community has to improvise the audio function on the latest version of it...cause in some devices this function doesn't work so kindly requesting to remove the bugs and launch a new update.........and please launch a new feature of end to end encryption password reset link cause from when I've updated the latest version then I couldn't access my backup from Google drive cause I forgot my password and now whatsapp is not running as well as before so Take my concern seriously
"Since I had a recent update, the replacement WhatsApp keyboard has changed and there's no carriage return. You cannot have paragraphs any longer. Like what I'm doing. What are the developers thinking!!!! Derrrrrr Put back the original authentic qwerty keyboard with a carriage return, as opposed to this rediculas new send button replacing the carriage return. It is now a send button. How many send buttons does it need to have one, NOT two. It is a ZERO star for me."
"I HATE THE NEW FEATURE ""COMMUNITY""!! I thought it was used for sorting the group chats. And suddenly, one of the groups members asked me why did I make a new group. IT WAS NOT FOR SORTING MY MESSY GROUP CHATS!!!! 😭 I don't think 'community' is the right update for this time. It's better for whatsapp to make an update to separate the group chats and personal chats in 2 different menus to make it seems more neat."
It is frustating how it keeps crashing and states there bugs and need to be updated yet it has been almost a week still no sign of the bug fixed. Could not open the app at all nor even to read the coming message.
Posted : March 2021 It would be better if there is any option for recovering the delete for me message... Because some people would accidentally delete a message only for them the message that they have thought to delete for everyone 😓 Edit: 25/12/2022 Thanks whatsapp for updating this feature ❤️
Works good for communication. It has a neat camera feature. I use it on a least weekly basis. I thought their messenger pigeon commercial was stupid. All that nonsense just to prove a point about Whatsapp. Also who is going to see the letter held by a bird flying so fast you would see the paper just for split second?
Photos from my gallery do not appear on dual messenger WhatsApp anymore. Only those sent through WhatsApp is visible. It still appears on my main WhatsApp app but not in the dual messenger one. I need to go into my gallery to select photos now instead of doing it through the app. Very tedious. Might be a bug.
I'll give you 5 stars if you can tell me how to stop this from automatically reloading back up after I forced closed it without touching it myself... I'm using a Moto G50 it keeps restarting back up in the background when I do not want it actively running.
"Give me option to hide my phone number and give ability to choose username instead of mobile number,i don't like people have my phone number and i only like username without showing my phone number to others.the biggest reason why use telegram is this. it's ridiculous to show phone number and everyone can contact you if they save your phone number . It's annoying please bring ability to hide phone number for all people and when turn on that people saved our number don't be able to send message."
"Don't use this app. Now a bug issue persists. You can't see your friends Profile photo, last seen , about all. Even he/she kept her privacy open to all. Even he/she can't see your status also. Fix this otherwise this app is useless. Sorry WhatsApp team you can't destroy someone's privacy by your own."
I have faces issues that is during video call on WhatsApp speaker turn to be automatically on and volume buttons not working fine and during video call sound is too loud. I hope you will fix it very soon or next update ASAP.
"Lost all my contacts names and my what'sapp picture got deleted. I lost a potential amazing match because she thought i am a scammer. I wanna use some curse words so bad. Anyways, I contacted Whatsapp and went through all their process and guess what nothing worked. If you do create an update make sure it works and doesn't have bugs in it. I am mortified as a customer."
"Very slow at windows, many feature is disabled. Like multi select message to forward, favorite sticker and very very very slowwwww at laptop. A bit slow at android"
"Hi, I love WhatsApp and it helps me a lot. I mainly just want to suggest an update where we can edit messages so it would be easier to correct something if we made a mistake instead of deleting theessage or re-writing it"
"Absolutely the worst , most useless programming known to man. How can WhatsApp web be so damned useless ? For unknown reasons it produces a qr code on occasions but usually never. If you lose webpage have to do it all again. It may work in a browser one time then never again. How can anyone design such trash and put it out to the public ? Appalled that such a useful thing could be made totally unusable"
"Kindly work of having the WhatsApp data to be stored in the cloud instead of on the Phone, it's been frustrating for the past few months now, even after buying a phone of higher gig ram. Uploading WhatsApp status hangs for so long and slows down phone operation,"
works fine but take up too much space in my storage. i'm really concern about my privacy since i've been talking to my friends about certain things and all of the sudden my ads are all about it. also the data takes too much storage space
"WhatsApp's service is very bad, back up crow, everything is not backed up, everything flies from above, all chats, all contacts, all documents, what kind of system is this absolutely rubbish. And my everything removed so important things documents, files all chats all important things I am very much disappointed from whatsapp team . how can it happens what kind of system I really really disappointed with your team and your system it is not fine anymore and never never...."
"For tha past one week, whatsapp performance is poor. Video calls and photo sharing gets frozen often. Volume automatically goes down. Lots of bugs in the beta release."
The new update is great however the call link that was shared doesn't has an expiry to it which means anyone who shared the link and the one who received the link can join the call anytime. Solution I think could be we should add an expiry time to the link shared or as soon the call initiator disconnects or leaves the call the receipts should no longer have ability to join the call. Hope this helps and Mark Zuckerberg identifys my comment and appreciate in any form.. 😀😀
"I am unable to add new items in one of my collections in catalogue. It always shows something went wrong. What's wrong with the app?The security they talk about is useless. Last year, i shared a YT video on the status and it was viewed by an int'l number. Such is the case when the app gives us no option to make it public. It was a UK based number, +44. This app is giving us a free model to chat and instead we're being used as a product we are unaware of."
"I am having this problem like always while uploading status The photo that should have been in the starting is always at the last (as i upload it later, 'cause forgot about the photo) So I'd appreciate it if you ""add a feature to adjust the position of photos in the status after uploading the status"""
"Last update changed the way gallery is displayed, when you try to send pictures not all folders are shown as they use to (camera, screen shots, dowbloads, etc), really anoying trying to find stuff in the gaery now"
"First of all, I'd like to say WhatsApp has been really awesome but over these past weeks, I've been banned temporarily for what I can't understand. I checked it out and was told I was either scraping or I had downloaded my version from an illegal site which can't be true cause I downloaded it right here. As for scraping, I don't even know what the word means. Now I just uninstalled and I'm reinstalling,please check this out"
I just cant understand the people's wich are complaining about this app. Its completely free and if it has any issue you can fix it with an update or reinstall of the app wich is also free. Best free platform for communication according to me.
"I liked the chat,call and status button which you gave at the bottom of the screen. Can you add the option in which we can post something in writing also other than just pictures. I made one group of my frnds in whatsapp today and the whatsapp showed three groups made with same name and people. Pls see the above problems and suggestions.."
At 1st I rated 5 stars but now I Don't wanna give a single star also because am having a lot of problems... The main problem is I cannot download and send any media. Can't see the status... I've a good connection of internet and a good working android phone but the problem is with whats app.. I'm here again after so many days but still facing the same problem my ig is working but what's app is not please fix it there are so many important things i can't delete it. Please fix it Mark Zuckerberg
"I changed my phone number and updated my Google account and yet when I try to reinstall it, it's still not downloading my backup from Google drive. At first it showed a backup but then it wouldn't download it. When I tried again it said no backup found."
I am a pc user i have used your web version and some of the issue i found i want to tell that in the pc web version we can't add a new contact just like phone we do and after few days it automatically gets sign out so request you to release a complete pc version which will take phone number for verificationjust the mobile version because working in pc and operating from phone is a very hectic for us so please release full complete pc version instead of scanning qr to use it in pc. PleaseseeASAP.
"For privacy reason, I've set the camera and microphone permissions to be asked every time I need them. WhatsApp since to be stucked at Android 5 or 6, since they redirect me to the system settings instead of using the permission ask API with the nice popup having the option ""allow for this time""... Please upgrade that to the newest Android standard (since at least Android 10)."
The app was great until it started like delay the message sending to the receiver it would like for 30min to 60 min to send it... please solve this issue.... I would be great full It may be temporarily but i hope that the company may solve it..
"A week ago, it started putting white frames around people in video calls, presumably when they are speaking. However, it is so sensitive that it picks up any slight noise with the result that these white frames are flashing on and off all the time. It's annoying and uses up more battery life. The only way to stop it is to turn off your mic. Please go back to having no frames. Since you can only have 8 people in a group chat, it's not necessary."
This used to be a good app. But these days it must update every second day. 😠😠!!New problem now is that i can receive voice message and i can record voice message but here is my problem THAT THE OTHER PERSON CANT LISTEN TO MY VOICE MESSAGE. I AM SERIOUSLY THINK TO DELETE THIS APP AND GET SOMETHING ELS TO CHAT WITH!!😠😠 So please help me so that i can send voice message again
"This is a very vital app for me...my whole life evolves around it but its becoming worse with every update. Most of the times I can't send or receive messages, can't back up and can't record voice notes. Thought it was my phone but nope..whatsapp business and other apps work just fine I literally have to uninstall and reinstall it for it to start working again."
tons of useless features which doesn't even use..Just make it simple like telegram. Give cloud storage to store files. A free app can do it without even money wby can't you. that's why signal got popular one day it will be over for you big techs. Sry it is already 60% over. for meta.
Just updated to Android 13 on my S21 Ultra and having audio issues. Audio cuts breaks every few minutes. Reinstalled but the problem still seems to be persistent. Any fixes? Thank you 💯
There's a error in the app. It says restore chat history and all chats are gone. Only recently backed up msgs are found. This is happening multiple times and causing inconvenience.
"After this update, when click on ""view votes"" in poll, then whatsapp closes automatically And shows ""whatsapp has a bug"". Is there any solution for this? I cleared the cache files as it recommended and whatsapp is upto date,but these things doesnt work."
"It's overall great application to chat with friends and family ... But nowadays there are many scammers who message and harrass you with unknown numbers... There must be an option to automatically block unknown numbers or a privacy setting where only your contacts can message you... From a past couple of days, i am being threatened by a guy , when i block him.. he messages me again using a different number.. it's all so annoying... Please add a feature so only our contacts can message .."
"When I played an audio message sent by my friend, my phone's screen turned black. And my didn't worked for 6 minutes (exact same duration as the audio message). No, this is not the problem with my device 'cause I have experienced same happenstance in my other phone too. This experience was certainly haunting. I can give you 4 more stars if you can fix this problem. Or WhatsApp can kiss uninstallation in my device."
Facing an issue. I am not able to delete contacts in WhatsApp though they are not in phone contact. Followed everything. But of no use. Roll out some feature to delete whatsapp contact directly
Backup in progress is stop half completely. Not going forward nearly 2hr also in same position. Previously version backup automatically completely fully. So many errors backup process.
"Well Amazing app...✌🏻 But few Amazing Suggestions to make up for the remaining 2 stars!😉 1.It would have been great if more number of participants could get connected on a video call (Rather plan for a online ""Whatsapp Meet""😎) 2. Try for something new..Like a Virtual Display Picture🤩(eg: inspite of static dp we could insert GIFs or a short video into the dps)"
"I can't send videos at all , keeps saying retry later or restart your device . it's so frustrating and when I want to send a picture on whatsapp it doesn't show in my gallery at all! this new update is stupid"
"It messed up all the photo attachment and some other settings after the android update. Can't select multiple photos , and doesn't show the gallery,have to separate go to the gallery"
"There is a new bug in the app where the backup process stucks in between and will not move forward. Example i have 50mb files to backup in google drive, after 25mb it gets stuck over there and will not continue. Please fix it..."
"I really rated this app because I could message in different languages. A real bonus when travelling abroad.There was an option which translated as I typed. However, I've just got a new phone, transferred all my stuff but WhatsApp doesn't transfer my chat history, has lost some contacts and hasn't got a translate option. I'm off to France , now, in tears!"
"The app is great, it has become more exceptional after adding polls, I believe it could become better if we could add polls to statuses, so that family and friends can vote and raise opinions, eg: what color dress, or what presents should I give my children, I believe that this app can do it"
"It used to be good, but not anymore. The call drops, lags by few seconds and isn't smooth. Group call is impossible. Update on Dec, 2022: Recently it complains that my account is temporarily banned because the app is downloaded from third party sources. What a downfall!"
"My account has not been working since 7 days, I updated my my WhatsApp on 7 November. After updated my account has stopped, I can't send video or images to anyone, as well as no one can send me any video or images. This is very bad and horrible experience. Please look into this matter as soon as possible. Thanks and regards JAYANTA MONDAL"
"Good app, counting on it daily, but,... In the last couple of months I keep on missing calls and messages up to 80%. For some reason the app its refreshing very slow."
Send message without saving a number is more helpful. If possible please change this specification. For ex : I got one customer support service or any other business account WhatsApp number. Without save the number we can't send message. Copied that number or type the number in contact search box. If search number is available WhatsApp then we want to show the contact.
Awesome app to talk to friends but it has a bit missing in groups admins should be allowed to delet message by other participants so they could delet those messages text photos etc. Containing bad material like porngraphy hacking or someone's privacy 🔏 so this thing should be added. Thank you if you read my review thank you very much again.
Backup issues It should be much easier to back up and restore chats and content when you get new devices. It's so tedious and doesn't actually work well. Very frustrating..
"WhatsApp is cool, just 1 step closer to great because WhatsApp should allow us to edit our messages to change what we wish only if the person has not seen our message like for instance whatsapp made it possible for us to delete our message even though it was sent, as long as the person did not see or get our message. Thank you."
I think there's a virus on the app my phone screen goes black when I'm on call and it flashes black but takes a while to stop. It also disconnects me from different games and stuff like that please check this out it only happens when I'm on call
"Very useful when it works, after 60 secs i often get muted for others.. changed for a new phone and still ! Other than that, lost all my messages on phone swap...years of chat, very annoyed to say the least..."
"Since i started using WhatsApp ive been able to communicate with friends and loved ones priavtely. I could as well video call, voice note, post things and do other things and it gets to those that i want it to get to. I doesn't go beyond that. I do my things privately and enjoy my chats. Thanks to WhatsApp"
Exceptional. App help me to keep contact with close friends and relatives. It's convenient and ways to reach people either by calling or face time or texting.
It stopped spending videos a few days ago and I updated my phone to the latest version hoping it will help. It keeps saying restart your phone and try later which doesn't help at all either. Have to start using other apps for communication.
"It was fine before. But after the update, photos from my gallery is not visible anymore ein the apps when I want to send pictures. I'll need to share those picture through my gallery instead of just sharing it simply in chat."
I've been using this over two years.. actual i experienced an excellent service with this app but now it's like the worst... i am getting banned like twice a day from like a week.. and i am sure i haven't violated any of your terms and policies.. i am really frustrated right now with all this.. hope you will fix this as soon as possible.....
"The best and most convenient texting app there is! It's fast and reliable. An added bonus is the desktop app to access your messages from your computer, super helpful!"
"I like the app, but updates weren't getting worse till date. In the new update, Archived section shows on top! I mean why a person would archive to keep the messages on top? Also, when I forward an image to another contact, it sends only the image and not its caption. Who would like to write caption again and again? Please improve the app. Otherwise my rating is 5 stars. Thank You."
"After i downloaded the most recent update, my Whatsapp has been useless. It's the 4th time my app is temporarily blocked today. I have been using my whatsapp for messaging as i have been doing for many years now, why this issue of temporary ban of a sudden? Can you help me figure out what exactly is wrong with my app or account?"
"Alhamdulilah I am well satisfied with thisapp.it helped me to communicate with my friends ,family members here and abroad easily.soalso it's a very secured app keeping all my secrets invisible to others.like fraudsters and so. I would like to be thankful to the whatsapp team for providing such a good service and also understanding me and my needs at the required time.and also I being a marketing person helped me a lot in easie communications with the people here and also globally. Thank you"
Auto-updated my whatsapp messenger. My whatsapp was running on an international number. But whatsapp provides no additional verification unless the code provided in the number via SMS. Which means a lot of important business dealings were lost. Then I had to install whstsapp for my local number. There should really be more than this one-step verificwtion for authenticating users.
Hello WhatsApp team..! 🙏 You are providing us very good and user friendly massenger. [Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart]... I want to tell you... That can we use Audio file or Audio/voice tags/ record features on our status... ? ( I mean MP3... Or other formats of audio files on our daily WhatsApp status.).. that could be great for us...or better and best features for us.... sometimes it's all it takes on some special moments... .. Please.... 🙏
Convert the quality of pictures to less resolution which we share.(direct as image) as well poorer the quality of DP. This problem is from long time(since i started using application) So i request to work on this problem and come up with some sort of solution Sharing image quality can be increased by sharing it as document but there is still problem with DP.
Ridiculous update where we can no longer just send photos or videos quickly and easily. Have to go through 4 steps to do it. Stop fixing something that doesn't need fixing
New update makes it extremely difficult to send pictures/videos. Impossible to navigate to the image /video you have just saved to send.
"This application is good and very useful, but it is not completely trustworthy. Because one day someone else got the photo that my friend sent only to me. I was shocked to see that photo in another group. So other photo videos can also be leaked like this. Our chat, video, photos, calls are not safe in this app and we are not safe and secure in this app. Please answer how the photo got leaked. And give us privacy, make our chat, video, photo, video call, call etc safe, ensure that it won't leak."
Change the video call settings.... It's very annoying that we can not fix the own face at a fix corner.... it's automatically coming to the corner of the right lower side.... It's very annoying....
"WhatsApp is very friendly to use, I have no problems with that. Just an idea, can't you make a setting so that Whatsapp calls can be recorded? I can't find a app that can record WhatsApp calls, and it will be super as I use WhatsApp for business purposes as well, and do a lot of WhatsApp calls."
"Recently I am facing some problems. Even after the update, I am not being able to view people's status from their profile pictures. I don't know how is this happening. But i checked the update version number with one of my friends and noticed it's the same. Yet he can experience the feature but I can't. Pls look into this matter."
It's a great app but I think you should add animations for sending message like in the IOS. The message should directly go above from the message box. That would be a great feature.
"I reported 2 spam accs and my acc got banned on the same day. I requested a review and then got permanently banned for 'violating the terms of service'. No proper reason why, no option on the app to write in my problem and no support contact address. Had to scour the website and come back to Google play store to find some email addresses to write to. Really disappointed. This was the main app i used to contact family, friends and work and overnight i lost all of that with no explanation :("
"I am pissed off by the fact that I cannot open it on my PC anymore. I cannot download it from the website as I used to so that I could make voice and video calls on my PC. I had to delete the old version temporarily and now it requires to get downloaded by Microsoft App Store. Installed and uninstalled over and over, the result is still the same blank page without even loading anything. Sucks! Fix it."
"When I try to send an image directly from Whatsapp (by clicking the 🖼️ or the 📎) only images that I have received via chat or that I have taken with the WhatsApp Camera show. To send a picture from my gallery I have to go to the gallery first and share it from there. An NO, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MEDIA VISIBILITY. I can see the WhatsApp images on my gallery, what I can't see are my gallery images on WhatsApp."
"Lost my mobile and got an old mobile with an old version of WhatsApp. WhatsApp would not work. Needed a new version of Google before I could download WhatsApp. 48h later, got a message from Google that eventually allowed me to download this version of WhatsApp. IT WAS SWIFT, IT WORKED FIRST TIME AND I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR IT."
Omg!!!!!! Why won't this thing stop vibrating!!!!! All of the vibration functions are off and yet it constantly vibrates WHEN I get a message. I say WHEN bcuz most times it won't notify me at all OR I'll receive a message from a person in the same room 4 to 5 min after. 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
"The most important app I have in my phone. The best communication themed app by far but still has a lot to improve, like managing spam bots and fixing issues related to the quality of the experience."
"My experience is very important and is going to be a good and wow! to me after these rating, the WhatsApp Messenger app rating is important to my businesses. Showing all those things without hardship, straineous activities for trying to open your business. Thanks to WhatsApp Messenger Rate app. The WhatsApp Messenger is very, very successful in that it's help to move one's business to be faster and successfully and also help in accessing the quality and the quantity of what is on ground."
"No support when account is hacked at least to disable. The guy who hacked my account has access but app blocks me. I got hacked very early in the morning I did not set up the two way verification but the other dude did it and I was not able to at least cancel my account. Somebody was asking money to my contac After several attempts I get into the app and I supposed canceled my account, now few days later I got sms requesting verification. Not sure if the account got canceled or not. Help please."
it's much better than before the ui and ux could use an improvement I'd like to be able to change the color of the app and other such useless customisation features I'd like a scheduled send option or a delay message send
"I've been using it for many years but now it's getting worse, I'm using it normally but suddenly it gets mad and exits the application force closes itself.... I've lost many data of mine because of this, I'm with updated verson but still it just happened to me right now that's why I'm rating it 1"
"Easy to use, reliable and it has great call connectiom without using a sim card, plus it is private and has status which is just so convient to post stuff you don't want to send to a bunch of people, in general a great app"
"I used to use whatsapp app on my desktop computer. with thr new update app wont work anymore while connected to the VPN, can't send or receive messages while connected to the VPN."
Whatsapp had an issue with the recent photos not appearing in the gallery. However after giving Whatsapp the permission to my photos and videos. The problem seems to be solved.
Not able to retrieve deleted messages. Not able to block group messages. This way one is bombarded with messages and the awkward way to deal with spamming is to opt out of the group altogether. This is very inconvenient
"The new Feature ""WhatsApp Community"" is great. But the limitation of Only Admins can post in the community makes it look like a Trash It makes it look like ""Broadcast Message"" Pro Max. If the feature can be updated to have community members engage in conversations and be able to post (and for it to also have ""Only Admin"" setting as well; just like Groups), it would be most awesome. This will increase community conversations. I like the fact it can accommodate more members unlike Groups."
I used whatsapp and raved about it for years. But now it.doesnt play messages on speakerphone and I can't fast forward or pause mssg mid listening. I cant type while listening and I used to be able to. I updated and still no change. I emptied my phone of photos to free space and still no change. Have switched to signal because my interactions are decreasing on whatsapp due to these limitations.
"I loved WhatsApp. Until about February this year. Since then in various time points WhatsApp crashes and goes into ""something went wrong. Restore messages"" Mode. Problem is, it doesn't restore the messages, but gets stuck in restore window forever until you force close it and then it's as good as a guess as anyone's what time point will be restored or if all messages will be deleted - even though I have daily backup enabled. It's really really starting to piss me off. Id love some help"
"As long as in privacy setting, hiding the last seen option was ok, but the new privacy option where people can hide their Online. Is it really necessary? No.. It's very disgusting and useless.. Too much privacy because of which people can cheat others easily. So it would b highly appreciated if u try to remove it and make it like it was before."
"Worked perfectly fine until the last update. I can't access my contact, I can't chat, I can do nothing. It says I'm logged out but I'm not, the continue button doesn't work. It's has been days and no new update. Incompetent devs."
All good but i have this issue for quite some time now where the voice note no matter if its sent or recieved when i put the phone directly to my ear the volume is very low though the phone volume where it should be it is a very annoying issue that makes me reconsider whats app
"I updated latest 13 Android version Having issue with the latest update. Not showing the full gallery when attaching images or videos from within the app. When selecting the gallery option from 3 dots, able to select only latest photo only not showing video Please fix the issue quickly"
I think that the NO screenshotting One View pictures is a very unpractical and garbage idea. When making a further update please consider bring back the chance for users to screenshot One View. Thank you in advance
"What's the essence of adding a community feature to whatsapp?? Kinda defeats the apps purpose in entirety. Then also uploading long stories(above 30 secs) on apps like Facebook and snapchat is easier because the apps break them automatically then uploads, why not add such a feature to whatsapp. Imagine the wasted efforts on uploading a video let's say for example, 3min long???"
"There are only a few things missing that would make me give this app a 5-star rating. Other apps let users respond to a message in a group via a collapsible thread. That would improve group chats in a big way to save space, because I know some people are annoyed by lots of text. Also, it would be great if sent messages could also be edited instead of just deleted. I have asked about this last part before. Editing saves time instead of deleting and typing over again. Apps like Telegram do it."
Media is no longer shown as a whole and its unnecessarily separated from a whole view. Image insertion is tedious and user interface has abruptly worsen.
"An awesome experience to use the said app especially fast communication especially sharing of pictures, images, MS office files, videos, audios in short a complete package of communication."
The most useless app I've ever use it takes 1-2 hr if we'll add multiple contacts at a time to sync. Example my phone has almost 50 contacts then I import all my previous contacts from drive. Then it took 2hr to show those newly added contacts.
"Seriously! After the last update, I tried to attach photos through WhatsApp, but it doesn't show my recent photos. I have to go to the gallery and tap on the photo/video to share it instead. Please fix it!"
"Pop up notifications must be available for any version of android.. .. it actually degrading that they cut the pop up notifications .. previously it was great, perfect but now it sucks .. I don't get notifications anymore when someone text me ..😔"
Vary poor quality.... Can't place voice and video call both correctly. Facing many problem with this messanger in last 1month. No improvement after updating the app. WhatsApp Support trying to help but issues not resolved. Thank you
Hi would really like to suggest a feature! It would be so useful and effective if we could adjust the time we would like to send a message. I'm a beta tester and I would to have that feauture.
"Experienced is getting better and better. But I would suggest one thing to improve, to pin 📌 the specific chat in the group. Something like star ⭐ but started message shows all the starred messages but what if I want to search in a specific person or group chat."
Facing problem of Linked device..after logging out of my PC device now unable to link any device.. Everytime it asks for unlock the phone and then again Link a device menu appears (instead of code scaner) very annoying..plz solve this issue.I have reinstalled w/a many times..but not working..
"It would be nice if there is a option to delete the 'deleted message indication', if we send wrong or unwanted message by mistake to the known or unknown person... Without this option, the receiver will be asking questions why we sent and deleted the message which is quite embrassing for the sender..."
I need to move away from this app as it become more and more growing in size because it constantly updates ....why does it have to keep update all the damn time ...i don't damn want to....so therefore i must transfer all messages and videos/photos and delete this app as soon as i done that and use another app that is less annoying with updates and less controlling overall.... i even have to give it one star.....would deserve 0 stars not 1 star....
"I have a issue in sending videos to other whatsapp user. Whenever I send a more than 1 minute videos then this message shown up ""Failed to process video, please try again later. If you keep seeing this message, please restart your device."" I have restarted my device several times but this message shown up again and again. Please solve this issue as soon as possible."
"What is wrong with this app, I can't post any video in my status. They keep saying restart your phone. I restart my phone many times still I can't post any video in my status ."
"Im little unhappy, I am using one plus mobile. My latest picture isn't coming/available to upload when I open the WhatsApp status. Also when I try using google photo app to take the photo it's not allowing me to update. It's says photo can't be updated now."
"Keeps crashing! Since yesterday as soon as I open whatsapp, it shuts down. I reinstalled it, same problem! Sent a few 'reports' about the problem. But no follow-up from their side! Not sure what to do:^("
"It's been a good experience, please consider the following features as additions to the app. Deactivating autoplay/loading of status videos and pictures, activate a 'do not receive status update' for a specific period, clearing already received status, pinning or having favourites status updates. Hoping to see some of these features, if not all in the near future. Thank you"
Terrible! This update is absolutely terrible! It suddenly stop sending messages. I have to restart my phone to get to send and allow message to go & come in. What a terrible update. I think I need to switch to another messenger
"Whatsapp was nice until the last update. I'm particularly annoyed that vns stop when I leave the app. And, when I play YouTube simultaneously, my vids stop as soon as a whatsapp video status comes on. Plus... Why, why, why did anyone think it was a good idea for statuses to appear where the whatsapp profile picture is?"
"What sort of rubbish upgrade is this,I can no send messages,I can't see my contact status anymore and it keeps stopping and restarting, this is the stupidest thing you WhatsApp programmers have ever done 🤬🤬👎👎if there is a way to rate you zero I would do it"
"Whilst there's nothing wrong with using text messages and phone calls to keep in touch, many people now use WhatsApp to send messages and make calls. It's an easy way to stay connected with loved ones and to send and receive photos and videos."
"Hi, I found small problem in WhatsApp application.  The selfie taken through the camera in the app is sending mirror image, not the actual image. Is it has any settings provision available , or it need to be addressed by making app upgrade. Appreciate your confirmation on this. Thanks  Sasidhar"
Recently app was updated. After that I am facing the problem while sending and receiving of the messages. It is taking too long to get delivered the messages. Need to look after this problem and try to fix this problem as soon as possible.
"I think you need to spend more time on Android version like you do in IOS, some big improvements on smooth animations and amoled friendly *useful* dark mode would do the job. This app is about to give its crown to other messenger apps such as Te..."
"Recently it's been logging me out of my acc saying that there are spam messages that I should review my phone number, after the review has been done and everything starts working well within few minutes of working it logs me out again asking me to redo the whole process again this isn't good...pls pls pls and pls rectify this...I'm not using my phone nor my acc to do anything shady or illegal...pls Also when it was working at times when viewing a statuses it skips the videos without viewing it"
"Over the period whatsapp is on roller coaster in releasing updates. Recent updates have a bug, if you delete a chat, the chat time stamp is still there, making it obvious the chat was deleted unlike in past where the chat moves down the time stamp of last chat active in the phone storage. Request team to fix it"
"Hi WhatsApp, can you please add the choice of turning off notifications in groups when changing number. It is really embarrassed when everyone gets notified when I change no. Can it be the optional to inform in group or not?"
"After i upgraded to android 13 ui5, i am unable to see any pop up notifications from WhatsApp... I went to settings its showing pop up notifification not available in the latest version of android.... So its very disgusting from whatsapp that they have turned off this setting on android 13....i have to evrytime open whatsapp that is there any messages or not... Really shame on whatsapp"
"It's a good messaging app,it has really cool features.🧸But only one problem I sometimes can't read a message because it is unsupported and when update my WhatsApp ...I still can't read a message I received(i even tried clearing up space)"
1 - I'm facing very bad quality in Video Calling.. 2 - While doing Backup of WhatsApp while install it in new device.. It's not doing everything backup. After doing everyday backup in drive also.. Kindly resolve this.
"WhatsApp is a good App. But I have a suggestion to make; bring archived chat box to the lowermost part of the chat and don't keep them *up* in the archive chat box. The purpose of archiving a chat is to not see it, what's the aim if I can easily see the archive chat box up my chats. If I want to unarchive a chat then, i search for archive, go into the box and unarchive the chat."
"Since the last update the app has become useless to me, can no longer send multiple pictures from my camera roll. Major downgrade to the app."
The new mode that allows you to connect your tablet to your phone account is EXACTLY the thing for which I had been waiting. Works incredibly well. Way to go WhatsApp!
"There's a ton of bugs in this app. Can't send voice messages, WhatsApp calls doesn't work properly. You guys clearly deserve the worst messaging app award."
Delay in reaching my destination. Link me to the current version to fascilitate communication with others too much time is wasted on reconnectipn. Sometime net work is a problem have said something now go ahead and I said go ahead and keep your body that connect me to my whatapp
"Whatsapp is very nice and easy to use. 1.But Kindly please extend the duration of status to 45 seconds 2.the number of sending of picture are limited to 30 please also extend them to 100 , when we send more then 30 pictures the whatsapp chat gets hanged. 3.Allow the extension of sharing within whatsapp, a file have to be forwaded to more than 15 peoples or groups ."
"Disappearing message admin can do it control. Please change it. It's honest person was struggling in the Disappearing protocol. Admin put it 24hours another person. The honest person was send report regularly. But there is no history after 24 hours. After 1week what will happen, think it, if u will do work everything was erased what will happen. In this method, those are honest definitely struggling, so don't give admin rights to put the any one or more 24 hours Disappearing message. Thank u"
Decent but.. can someone remove the Archive folder from the top of the message list? Whose idea was it to put it there in the first place? That defeats the purpose of archiving messages😂 smh.
"It's a great app and it worked perfectly fine for years UNTIL a few months ago when a lot of the time when I try to open WhatsApp, it lags SO much and takes like 10 minutes to open properly and send a message. I know for a fact that this has nothing to do with my phone in general because every other app on my phone works smoothly, and because a few other people I know have the exact same issue as I do, and the rest of their phone is working fine too. Thanks❤️"
This application and I don't have to find a different types of file attachments ok with the clients requirements I am trying hard to believe that the last updated version required by law or regulation and is an automatically generated by the end you can trust me don't want to know what I have to say thank you for your assistance with this mail finds a daily basis and can you send some more information please login and I'm not going to find a different types of our products and solutions services
"This app is good so far. But it would be useful if we can categorize our chats (ex: family, friends,school,work ). I would appreciate if you could add this feature in your future updates."
"After the latest update, if we delete a recent message, that particular chat name/group is still appearing at the top of the list. Ideally, the list should re-arrange itself in descending order (as per date/time)."
"WhatsApp need to be a little more private. After you have chat with someone and you come out of it you shouldn't be able to see what the had person had text. Yes this app is going to be private and protected, then hit does not need to be showing any conversation that other people can see what you saying."
There is a problem on calling in WhatsApp my voice is not reaching to next person who is on call even the mobile microphone works perfectly please make sure to rectify the problem as soon as possible. Thank you.
"After the recent update,even if we delete the chats with a person or in a group,that contact or group does not go down, indeed remains...please make it like before with the next update soon, don't wanna see some persons on top of whatsapp chatlist, literally everyone wants to happen...infact with update going back to such interface is not expected at all...this is my playstore review,so seriously speaking"
"Updating the About section is impossible. The app pops an 'Updating' process window which takes forever, and makes me to close and reload the app once again."
Google drive backup isn't working anymore hope you check it it's the second time Iam losing my data after a reinstallation backup found and it just stucks there it's been an hour and my WhatsApp hasn't opened yet it just says preparing backup..
I was enjoying this app ..but after the last update in video call if i mute the call it's showing a sentence in the middle of the screen.i can't see properly someone's face..please fix it ..
My contacts couldn't see me when I'm online even I've changed the setting so everyone are able to see me when I'm online during using this apps. Personally I'm very disappointed for this matter.
S android phone has a pretty wide variety but it can also make you look more like it can get better in quality with a good battery or tablet or iPad and iPhone can easily fit the best with you using your smartphone to use it with a low or high level quality cable with your iPhone charger for one tablet
last update was the worst. you killed the option to send videos! and to send pictures on Android you have to go through nine circles of hell. worst app ever!
"A nice app! Usually It just Kicks me out of the app! Ridiculous! Overall, a Reliable app to communicate with others I still prefer Telegram. I will Recommend this app to my Best Buddies And Families! Looking forward for new updates!"
"After this latest update lm having problems replying messages on pop-up notifications, which l have been easily doing all along. The app automatically stops working and stops all processes on my phone."
"Photo issues. Pls fix it. Gallery folder should be in the main selections, not hide in the menu button. Plus... not able to add any pictures."
"I love this app I have been using it for the past six years and no problem,but I would like if they could make us reply to someone's bio and people could also reply to our bio I know it is not easy trust me I've been there but if they could really do that I would be glad."
"I think this WhataAp and its Messenger is beyond description. No other Apps I found like these one. So to get 5 ""STAR"" for these two ""Apps is not the matter. I am surprised on looking their activities and quick response to the users and of their veriou features is only possible for their experienced engineering activist and Developer as wel. So Obviously no question I have about their any lacking but still we are all users both home and abroad have expectations to get more excellent a head."
"Good , excellent service But interface is not user friendly... Please make some user friendly updates like wallpaper , emojies and colours Green colour is some times unpleasant.. Please make some user friendly features"
The latest update will not allow me to send multiple pics from the gallery and you have to go to your gallary via the 3 dots in the top corner after you selected to send media otherwise it just shows whatapp media that has been sent or received.
I dont know if its a glitch but the names i change dont seem to change on the app and i cant edit it .....even when a contact is deleted from my phone i still see the contact on the app .....please fix this its soo annoying
"Feature to disable disappearing message for an opted contact and for self is essential. Sometime, we require to keep the chat for future references."
"Wow once upon a time whatsApp was everything aft so many new features added now we can't even know whether the message is delivered or not even with high speed internet stickers will be remain unsend whole day, sometimes messages will be not sent even with high speed internet if these things will not be considered better to switch some other platform"
"In New update has a bad experience because, when i opened status then recent photos and camera folder are not shown.. it's a really bad bug in new update."

App keep on crashing when I scroll down my chats. Its frustrating. Can't we get older version back? Its frustrating that app keeps on crashing
"My phone number was banned by WhatsApp for no reason given. I've been using whatsapp for many years as my daily communication app but now I am unable to use it anymore, it force me to change to telegram and leave WhatsApp forever. Thank you WhatsApp to finally show me how much better is telegram compare to WhatsApp."
I am not getting the image's saved in gallery I have even checked the media visibility.. But not able to get the image's in the gallery don't know what to do.. I had even tried with backuping but no use.. I'm not able to get new updates
With the recent update over video call if you try to do multiple task or keeping the whatsApp open in slide bar and video will gets off and doesn't on. Biggest glich on video calls
There is a very serious issue in my whatsapp.....no videos or photos are sending to anyone....and it's processing is also very slow....I'm unable to watch statuses and to send something....pls fix this asap
"I am not happy with facebook's policy to make whatsapp collect data about me and my phone. I consider this a privacy violation, and unauthorised theft of my life by facebook. Low score, dislike and uninstalled the app, with no intention and no vision to install ot again. Signal and Telegram are my apps of choice, never again whatsapp."
"Omg i can't believe WhatsApp had came with a new feature to as ""message to yourself"" it's really amazing talking to yourself sometimes no one is available to talk to yourself but you can't talk to your own it's help to understand yourself this was first for experiencing it but it's was really superb i was shocked by this feature i really impressed thank you very very much lot of love to the creater ❤️❤️"
"Used to be great, allowing ease of attaching photos and comments, now the multiple photo does not work and difficult to attach photos then only 1 at a time - developer's please read this and answer the query / change it back"
"Nice app, but I don't like the fact that you can't take a screenshot or a screen record of a view once picture or video. Update really bad not enjoyable at all"
"Very good interms of messaging,voice record and video call and very easy to use to send message to the people that are not only in Nigeria and work very fine when you have full access to network"
"I am very happy with the update but want to say that, whenever we are clicking on profile picture to see the profile picture in full size its redirecting to the status of that person instead of showing the profile picture, Please fix this."
"Previous photo attachment sequemce was better, can no longer find my photos easily nor select multiple photos. Downgraded user friendliness, bad!!!"
"Since the last update you sometimes can't send songs to your friends, it's been really bad because normally l download songs for my friends and send it to them but now l can't even do that now😫"
"It is hands down one of the most revolutionary technologies of 21st century. I have two suggestions though: 1) add a 'salute' emoji 2) increase number of pinned chats, atleast to 5. I love the feature but want more"
"The updates improve even more the app, but sometimes you send messages and it doesn't send right away, and please add offline mode sometime i want internet on my phone but i don't want to be online on Whatsapp."
"Hi sir, In WhatsApp, the block option only shows inner chat. So, that will makes the message was seen by me for sender.. so, can you make block option in outside of chat for unknown senders to without seeing msg.. Thanks in advance.."
Do you know why whatsapp payment is not popular than phonpe or Googlepay? Because it doesn't provide automatic search of UPI ID like Google Pay is doing. Pls add autosearch upi id like in imobile app. It is very difficult to pay to phonepe and google pay numbers. We need to ask for QR codes always. And many ignorants don't know why it is required. They always ask us to switch to Google Pay. When will you learn from it?
Recently i cannot download the media even i never do so. Its like i delete the media but i NEVER download in the 1st place which VERY ANNOYING. And older attachment will be gone really frustrating as i use it for work purpose
Facing problem in video calls. Screen freezes and application stops working altogether. Extremely frustrating.
Audio is poor during video calls (has been for awhile) and since the last update all my videos that I post onto my status has been cutting at 5 seconds in. #FixThisPlease
"It has no facilities to uplod video states in single uploading. You should have to do many part and upload. But some time some message is missing, because of making to many piceses."
Hi uninstall WhatsApp from my phone because of the storage but when I reinstall it show me that I have backup of yesterday but when I am backing up it is saying to add a password or provided with a 64 digit encryption key but earlier I didn't have any other password for the encryption key so I didn't know what should I do so please if anybody not please tell me or WhatsApp please fix this bug
The new photo sender is absolutely terrible. Can't add more than 1 photo at a time and it's such a pain to find photos from my own gallery
This is a terrible update. You can't even change your profile picture picking from the gallery. It doesn't read the camera photos completely in the app
"Chats haven't date and time. Haven't setting for show date and time. Can't add linked device, camera show black screen. I can't export chats in csv or json mode. Images media very poor after forwarding"
"WhatsApp is reduced to a hypocritical Messenger. - The app detected my incorrect date. - I adjusted back my date (2022/12/18) - I just updated the app (Device model: HUAWEI AGS-L09, since 2014) - The app claimed expiry on (2022/09/18). What on Earth? I did update WA at the correct date & time. Overall, WA became a petty scrap chatterbox that won't respond to HUMAN ACTS properly. What does this machine want us humans to do?"
I am not satisfied with the lated feature. Showing of status of the person with their profile is really distracting when I have no interest in veiwing that person's status. The status are available in the status slot I think that's enough.
"Just about some weeks ago I don't know what has come upon this app, any link I click to take me to another page the error message I have been getting is that ""you may not have a proper app to view this content"". Please, help resolve this o"
"It's work very good .But from last few days it stop working suddenly.I don't know how will it work again because I try all the thing like reinstall,switch off the phone but not restart yet .When this happens first day there has sorry message in which one said sorry for this you we mistakenly take your whatsapp account under us.Then it start working for 2 hours but then again stop and display show verify your number but there is no sms or call for verification code . What I do for my whatsapp ?"
All of a sudden whatsapp media's sent by others are getting auto deleted. And I am not using any cleaning app or storage manager. Please fix this problem immediately.
"Disastrous. In terms of features wechat and line are better alternatives. Edit: new update is trying to be messenger. At times, maybe people wish to see someone's display picture and not their stories...just maybe you could give people that option 🤔"
"rate zero if possible. got calls from unknown numbers spammed, can't block automatically, the button to access said function is the same place as the accept call... GREAT DESIGN!!(sarcasm)"
"After deleting the messages, the contact used to go down in chats. Now its still showing on top. Want back the previo design where deleted the message could go back to history for date sorting"
"Awesome, most easy to use; super fast connectivity, video call experience is the best in the class of apps. I love the app."
"I'll only give you one star, because after the last update I can only send test messages and the rest of the features do not work now. voice, pdf, images, status None of this works."
"The new version has some issue. In the earlier version specific message once deleted, the chat used to get sorted by dates but that is not happening now"
"Since the update, I can't see my friends quick photos (the ones like snapchat). It just says to update WhatsApp to see, but there is no update. Its been like this for a good month now."
"The new photo picker when sending images is terrible. I cannot select most recent photos anymore, I have to open the gallery each time."
"Privacy and security is in our DNA, which is why we built end-to-end encryption into our app. When end-to-end encrypted, your messages, photos, videos, voice messages, documents, status updates and calls are secured from falling into the wrong hands."
Latest downgrade is not at all helpful... Can't send videos. Only one picture. Totally messed up the gallery view. Multiple negative issues... Best downgrade ever if that's a category to rated. Did you all get hacked or what? Hacked or someone on crack got upgrade and downgrade confused!
"Hello, Mr. WhatsApp Communications Company. This is really a great app, but I want my speech to reach some people through this program. Please make it easy for me because I can't send them messages."
Most convenient app to use. I really love it. Please improve in terms of wallpapers and try to bring out more themes option.
"Whasapp is a great app,however it seems it doesn't release the updated version to all countries the same time.I needed to update it for the latest version 2.22.25.20 with updated features, but play store doesn't give me the option to update,rather open"
"It may be a good app for texting,but y it takes so long to send a video even when it is small size or my network connection is good....that just make impatience..pls fix it ..🙏🏻"
Yeah...this is very good but I have a one problem that is when we achieved a chat that should displaying in the top of the chats that was not good at all... We achieved that for no one can see the messages...then why that was displayed their.. I think that it was display below the chats...🙃..
This app could be excellent if you could improve on voice note volume so that it doesn't stop when u pull the phone to the ear to listen... That part took away ur 2 stars
I love this app. So useful. By the way new updates are very useful & creative. My favorite one is Avatar Creator. But can you add more backgrounds for the avatar feature. Not only colours. Like images. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"Feature request: We need an option to pin important messages in a group, such as a poll for at least a week's duration. The pinned message should show up first whenever we open a group, as this would ensure that nobody misses on it"
New launched features in 2022 are awsome but Can you launch a feature of mentioning anyone from our contact to our status it will be a easy for those who don't use other social medias app please try to include this feature.. Thank u😊
"Good one Now, but needs more development in following areas: 1. Status saving option 2. Built-in option for getting Offline, so that users can use wifi/data for whole phone except Whatsapp.. Sometimes users need it to get relaxed from texting."
Thank you for approaching to my previous review regards poll feature. From now since whats app is upgrading very well I would request the Whats app team to include Online contact list and feature turns on notification over the some ones availability. Thank you ... !
Took a few pics with my phone. It's in my gallery but it doesn't show on WhatsApp. I can't send it cause it's not showing to send it. Obviously I updated it. Please fix
After the recent update I have difficulty seeing the status suddenly it goes black and only the song is playing or if I see the picture I can't hear the song in the status 🙂😑
Usually go to app and intuitive for use but the latest update for sharing pictures and videos is a nightmare. Hate it.
"While connected to bluetooth audio for calls, It can't switch to bluetooth audio. We need to hang up the call and call again. Suc*s"
"I gave one star because, WhatsApp has been misbehaving...they log me out everyday... since I updated to the latest version...and it takes between 12 to 24 hours to get access back into my account... This is so annoying. Pls you guys should make this stop."
Super upset!!!! My personal gallery for photos doesn't show automatically and can't attach multiple photos. PLEASE FIX
"The right hand bottom key was changed to send. It is awful, it has has happened that the unfinished message was sent."
Not a clue what you have done to the photo sending options but I can't access any pictures other than ones I've received through WhatsApp. Really frustrating and makes me seriously consider ditching WhatsApp
"There is problem in Android 13 on samsung device, I can not share recent media directly on multiple selection at a time. I have to select one by one. This is hectic. Please fix it."
I am having trouble signing into my account on a new device. For 2 days now I am back and forth with tech support. Not getting anywhere!!! Insane! Simple task that I cannot get help with!
Thanks to making this because after i think that whatsapp is worst but before I thought in lockdown that no it is not worst it my experience in lockdown because when school were closed the online classes is begning in this app after that i cover up my all leftover studies very fast . Thanks again for this app
Overall good app. Would have given an extra star if it worked as an app on my smartwatch. And an extra star if the gallery / image situation was resolved. But otherwise the app works well enough.
"This is the best app I keep in touch with my loved ones through it The various options included have proved to be very useful I share my daily routines, and my experiences with friends This is the best app to keep in touch with your loved ones I enjoy it a lot when I use it It is very simple and easy Thank you ❤️ @Team Whatsapp ❤️❣️👍🤩"
Takes ten calls for my dad to hear me. My sister calls with no problem. Tried submitting a request to help center. Nothing resolved. Tried toggling microphone in settings with no change. This is awful.
The back-up process if full of bugs i lost my 9k stickers which should've been back-up too and also the media i got my texts but not my media smh imporve this what's app asap it's really disappointing to see an app like this do this
After last update. The messages time changes to year 1989!!!! My message time and sender's time is not match and have discrepancy. PLEASE FIX IT ASAP.
"Very disappointed with this version. While deleting recent messages, the user isn't going down as per the date and stays on top. Disgusting"
The app is very very awesome but If we have to forward any photo or video it has to be sent 5 people it takes a longer time to send the photo or message to everyone if it is forwaded many times then the forwarding limit changes from 5 to 1 that should be changed.
Its a good but need a amegitaly change . The option open once need too secure more that if we send a once open pic then the reciver can only open it once and cant take screen short .plz need it .it can secure us
I have someone's photo and videos in sent folder of WhatsApp media main folder how can it possible.. it affects my privacy.take action on it..and you guys tells that end to end encryption.. actually where it is ??
"Since the update, I can't see the STATUS being posted by my contacts, I can't send pics from my gallery, not all the albums are available, please fix this ASAP."
Terrible app won't allow you to update. You download the update it opens and asks you to download the same update again. Also gave my phone number to some other random person. A real breach of privacy.
It's truly Amazing....but would be great if you can add voice note to your status 😜. Instead of just typing or posting a picture.
"Please about the Profile photo privacy area; there should be a way to select ""Everyone except..."" so that more people can view your profile photo, but few people can be disallowed. Thank you"
For those who cannot find the photo gallery when wanting to share photos & videos. Goto APPS>WHATSAPP>PERMISSIONS and scroll down to NOT ALLOWED and you'll find that photos & videos are in NOT ALLOWED? Just click allow and you'll find your photo gallery back..
"Don't know what everyone's talking about. Had a perfect experience with WhatsApp, it is my most used app 🤩 I mean, what's not to love? You can text, post status', call people (video and voice), you can make groupchats. It's just great! Fabulous work WhatsApp team 👏"
"Would be better if you can post a status with a longer time at least 3 minutes and without making the video resolution compressed😒 Videos also get compressed when I send it to my contacts, how annoying😤"
I've been enjoying Whatsapp till my account got banned 🚫. Up till now I don't have access to Whatsapp and I've lost connection with people I communicate with on the app. I've equally lost my groups as I was forced out of it. This is really unfair. I've reached out though email.l yet nothing had been done. No response.
"At the image sharing time, user have an option for send an original size picture to other. Most recommended rather than compressed image."
"After the last update , it has become very irritating, If we miss any whatsapp audio or video call- After deleting same name of the recipient remains on top .and doesn't go back to old last date of chat."
No doubt WhatsApp is very useful and most popular app and. I am satisfied with this but one thing. I think Whatsapp should add in their features which is more options in them except dark and white so it looks more attractive.
After recent update i can't see call upcoming that who is calling me only the sound i can hear and when i open whatsapp then i can see by myself that man is calling me i also don't know someone is sending me massages because i can't hear notification tone. Now this is very unuseful for me
"WHATASPP APP CAN'T MATCH WITH ANDROID 13!!!!!!@ Ever since my last update on my Gaxlaxy z flip 3 the app doesn't allow me send multiple pictures, I had to send one by one , can anyone do something to upgrade the WhatsApp please!!! So that can compatible to android 13"
"Wth happened??? My gallery's pictures no longer show on the whatsapp gallery to send. Now I have to go to my gallery and share the picture, it used to be so much easier! This update is a huge downgrade 🤨😑😠"
"Why on EARTH did you change the image uploading option??? I have to separately select my gallery and downloaded videos don't show up AT ALL. Reverse ASAP please, this is extremely inconvenient"
"It's an amazing 👍 up but unfortunately I can't restore my previous chats, messages, voice notes, videos and photos too 🤔🤔 kindly advise me on what to do here."
Their tech support could do with an upgrade (so annoying going in circles with computer generated circular answers).. But it is a great app
"For everyone having difficulty accessing your photos while using WhatsApp, I had the same problem when I upgraded my mobile. You need to tap Settings, then tap Apps, then tap WhatsApp, tap Photos and Videos, then click Allow"
"This application is very useful for communication, although you may experience some issues due to internet connection or server problems but It rarely happens. So download it since it is a good communication app."
"I need to give five stars! This app is really amazing. I love it but please developers i may say u need to input a status downloder as it was before. Thanks for poll, voice record in status and for security. I am happy if u add more magnificient features."
Removed features Why can't I send videos from the gallery and why those it default to media previously sent. 1 step forward 10 steps backwards update.
"Can y'all please fix the bugs on this app please! I'm. It getting my calls and messages in real time. This app was so good, now its turned for the worst and I don't understand why."
"It's too amazing and secure for using.... No words for explaining,😍.... Now in next update please update camera filter and other interesting things.... Camera quality of WhatsApp is not good then please update camera filter and other useful things...."
"16.12.22 — App screen turning into black if I try to forward any msg.. Updated but still having the issue.. Pls check Update 20.5.21: it started working. Still after 3 updates, the issue not resolved. I'm unable to use WhatsApp web in another device, it's keep on loading but it's not opening.. Pls check. Issues in whatsApp web in latest version,I'm unable to connect from this POCO C3 mobile.. tried reinstalling also..27.12.20"
Can you guys please add screenshare feature in new update ? I want this feature to be added so I can see my friend screen while video calling and so I can look at game info. Thank you if you adding this feature. Thank You.
There is an issue if I send message so long time to take blue tick although the persons read this message. I tried this with my two phones same issue appeared.
"Hi! Thanks for the app. Just one problem: Since a few days I can't get WhatsApp messages/calls unless the app is open. Please help! 18th December 2022 Please update the app, it has many bugs."
"Hi, want to give a little a feedback again. I'm maybe not a beta user, but the quality when I tried to upload at status is just horrible, really want WhatsApp to fix this. That's all thank you."
"After update i can only locate images sent or received via whatsapp not screenshots, downloaded images etc. Also i cannot put up a video status as it can't locate any downloaded videos."
"Hello , I want to know if there is any bug with the new update. Once I logged to my account/phone number its keep saying ""Whatsapp keep stopping"" and force me to close the app, if this is a bug please fixed it.Thank you."
"After update, if I open gallery in chat then it's not showing all photos. Even photos taken from camera is not visible in all photos option in attachments."
"I can't with this app anymore.....since December 2 I've been banned.I keep on requesting a review because i genuinely wonder how i could have been banned when i barely even used this app.Then once a review has been done ..i put my number and it literally says something along the lines of..""you have requested a verification code too many times.""WHAT!?Then now my number is supposedly *BANNED* I will keep on bad-mouthing your app until you fix this issue...Fix this damn issue!!!!!!"
"GALLERY PROBLEM EASY FIX!!!!, GO TO SETTINGS AND ALLOW PERMISSION FOR PHOTOS AND GALLERY. I had the same problem untill i had a mess around in the settings. I was very annoyed and wanted to remove whatsapp."
I like the app but there is alot of issues especially on Android devices like 1.cant send big files 2.isnt optimized with Android only optimized with its meaning whatsap reduce Androids quality on pics and vids 3.when playing vn on Android black-out the screen 4.when taking pics on whatsap quality is poor 5.we want longer 5minute status vids 6.cant send a video to someone over 2 minutes pls change that 7.cant send big files to Friends So pls add those features and change stuff
Its a good app...but when I send a view once to someone...the person will be able to screenshot or screen record the image or video...and the WhatsApp calm keeps hanging even with sufficient network and data...
"This bug is rarely shows up and its annoying. This one bug which is changing the profile picture, i tried to tap to change pfp and its not letting me, i also tired closing and reopen it and it still not working. Please fix this bug issue."
Honestly good app could use some changes here and there But I'm giving you four stars cuz when I put my phone on battery saver mode(not the extreme one) my stickers get deleted and this has happened thrice already and now those packs can't be found so big F.
"There is a problem in app, when I want to share anything with my friends. I can share it only upto 5 persons at a time. Please remove thus restriction so that we can sent anything to many persons at a time"
"Latest update broke the app, notifications are dead, not even showing up in the android settings and can't send images with permissions granted"
Please provide option to backup only the chat and option to exclude the media...Right now I want to transfer chat data from my old to new but the backup is taking the media part also and so the backup size has become 4gb...what option do I have to backup only the chat history?
"Yes WhatsApp is No 1, No doubt, I have a idea to improve.. 1.the option to customise our Dp to selected contacts and 2.Length of video 3.who is viewing our Dp 4. CAN improve with the status view settings not only for 24 hrs, which is to save all our Status uploads.."
Its horrible when it comes to changing profile pictures and resizing and has lots of other issues. Meta developers wth are you doing.
All of a sudden it keeps reconnecting. All day today. Reconnecting reconnecting. My partner can hear me but I can't hear him. Fix it! 🤬🤬🤬🤬
Video calling function have become very wrost. Always laid down at when we zoom out video call In previous version it was at blur at poor connection but this time its wrost
It was very difficult for me to be in this App.All the apps were deleted from my device .I would like to know if this is done by internet or the developers.Even my contacts are not backing up together with my bank apps.
My phone showing chat account is not allowed to use whatsapp due to spam while m using play store version. Follow all t&c then Re register my no. After one day again logged out it's going regularly from one week. No support from what's app team. We should be find alternative of what's app like signal.
Everything is working perfectly until my videos only allows me to share 0.01 and it's annoying and frustrating. I already cleared my storage space and everything that could be the reason but I don't seem to know how to resolve it. Please let me know how I can share my videos again..
"Completely useful, more so because of being able to post your daily experiences, your feelings, urgent matters etc.... And also because of being able to view people's statuses."
Even tho i updated my whatsapp .. i am still locked out and its telling me to download the update and when i click download and go to playstore its not there BECAUSE I UPDATED IT ALREADY. The date also isnt wrong so i dont know what the problem is . PLZ FIX IT
"After last update when Avatar are added, my gallary pictures and video are not visible in WhatsApp. I can't share pictures and videos from WhatsApp Camera option. I have to go to gallery and share it from there everytime. Please solve the issue."
Day by the size of WhatsApp is increasing. It looks like more as Computer Desktop app rather than mobile app. Size of the app should be small so that users don't have to go for new mobile in order to use mobile apps as the size is getting bigger. 10 such apps eats up all memory then how mobile could be functional ?
New update changes default photo directory to WhatsApp and not gallery. Can't change this. Also can no longer share multiple photos from gallery. Just one at a time. Dumb
After the recent update.. the incoming and outgoing call and video call are not connecting and not able to attach the screenshot images .. please work on it ASAP
WhatsApp is getting worse day by day please back in original form new. I don't like these updates honestly. For example the update in which you can see status of others by taping on there profile. Just like Instagram 😑😑
"Now I am getting jio advertisement on my WhatsApp personal chat. Even after blocking I am getting ad from new number. First youtube then Facebook and Instagram. Now, even whatsapp has also started showing ads. I mean just leave us alone. It is so irritating. It is my personal space . 😡"
Why is it not been able to recognise phone camera gallery or photos? I am unable to send camera photos or change my dp! Something is wrong after the latest upgrade!!!! Please fix this problem.
"Is there anything good that whatsapp did after facebook bought it? Or is it just data leaks?! I mean, atleast make the app more appealing! How about just copy everything from telegram?! Give us options to customize the app, let us add people through usernames, so we don't have to give our numbers to everyone!!"
It's really hard to enjoy the app when it has poor performance I can't videocall coz it's either u can't hear the person's or u can't see them those are the problems am facing currently.....
"""WhatsApp is undoubtedly a good messager app. In order to make it the best app, it is requested to enable the group admin to delete irrelevant/problematic content of others from the group."" Thanks for considering my suggestion"
"I don't know what's wrong, I deleted the app and re installed it because it kept on hanging but now it's not opening. I've deleted it again and re installed it, still not opening"
The best app ever.. after all it's home to me and my love😌 though I've rated it 5 stars but more precisely it's 4.9 and this is because it lacks the call recording feature.. and I feel the need of the same..
"After recent update, worst one. Video calling not able to connect. Not able to share picture or video directly. We have to go in gallery, then we can share."
"What did yall even do? I have the same issue as everyone else with the photos. I dont want to see photos I've already sent, I want to see my gallery To send photos AND yall dont even reply to the ratings"
"Can u fix the problem where we cant send multiple pictures?? And the phone gallery wont even show when we press the gallery, it shows us the group's photo instead, and we cant select the photos we want to send."
"Since last update I'm unable to access the phone gallery on Whatsapp for pictures and screenshots. No help recieved. Also, no appropriate response from the company or efforts to fix the issue!!"
"Actually till today I have been very comfortable with the updates of WhatsApp, but the latest update keeps the chat I mean the contact on top of all chats even if that recent message is deleted and only then the contact is being removed if all the chat is cleared in that contact. I request please fix this problem 🙏 😔"
"Very good, just sometimes when the network is not good it keeps on reconnecting, that's the need for improvement."
"WHY THE HELL PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN MY CONTACTS SEE ME AS ONLINE??? The worst feature of whatsapp is that any random person anywhere on the planet can save your no. and see you as being online even if they are not in your contacts. I am being stalked by a group of ppl on WA and they keep sending me msgs from different numbers whenever they see me as ONLINE. I have blocked all the numbers, but they just send me msgs from other numbers. ""ADD A BLOODY PRIVACY OPTION FOR SHOWING ONLINE STATUS"""
I am not able to download any images or videos that are received in my WhatsApp account..Also the status is not getting downloaded.. I have enough memory in SD card as wel as in phone. Kindly guide me to solve the issue
What is the use of inviting for beta version when you don't care about feedback? Chats still showing on top even after deleting their recent message. Please fix this bug. Add option to jump through chats date wise.
"What happen to the phone gallery? When try to send to others, phone gallery such as video & photo not showing up anymore through ""camera"" shortcut button in whatsap chat, please fix it. Thanks"
This app is used for scams criminals blackmailing and prostitution. Please do not use this app for any reason and if you do backup all conversations you have. Make sure you can see their number and there full name. And good luck
"It was working fine but after recent updates having issues related to what's app calling. Also when trying to send photos unable to see recent images,i have to go gallary and have to send images. Kindly solve this issue I am using f21 pro 5 g"
Please make improvements on whatsapp live location. Its to slow to update someone location. And it's always delay with the movement. Please make more improvements cause whatsapp live location is helpfull for us to know where our parents and family locafion. Second one is please make more longger to post video on status. Please make more longger than 30 second because its difficult to keep on cropping the video's just to post it.
"Not able to open app, getting crashed as I click...already lost my data once due to same problem in last 15 days.... please help resolve the issue. Thanks 🙏"
"No longer getting pop up notifications or on my fitbit. Can now only attach WhatsApp images, rather than camera or gallery images. Needs fixed ASAP!!!"
"Why have they made it harder to add photos, not able to add more than 1 photo from gallery after choosing folder. Updates are supposed to improve things not overcomplicate things"
"Gallery has been messed up as other people have said, need to press the 3 little dots in the corner to get the photos I want to send.. Ruined the whole user experience"
Sometimes the status will not show properly like error is coming... couldn't see the status... please work for that...and all features are excellent...
To be honest it is easiest and fastest way of communication but if you add A bit of security in it. It would be very helpful
I couldn't receive message notifications despite having good wifi connection. I've checked I didn't turn the notifications off or silent my phone. Please fix this problem tq.
"What's app is great , but lately very irritating, needs a feature time based where one can receive only during those hrs after which incoming msg won't be recd , will be stored on server"
"My video calling features not working, it's show connecting all the time. Please solve this issue as soon as possible."
"Nice app, my best actually for communication but when it comes to status update you can only post 30 seconds, for each video. Please increase it to 50 or even 1 minute then I can rate it five stars thanks."
"Why my WhatsApp is not working whenever I am sending a message, it is not going to be early. Why is it going to be good after time while my data is working well. Pls fix this bug!!!"
There is some problem with WhatsApp I am not getting notified when anyone sends me messages in WhatsApp even when I have my (notification)sound full and vibration also also I tried many fixing steps but is same WhatsApp please solve this issue as soon as possible.
"Silenced on DND is very bad feature. If my phone is on silent mode, I don't get the call. Please remove this feature. Or just give it as an option. Don't make it compulsary for all users"
poll feature : 1. Bug - presently app allows people to vote for multiple options. This should be fixed. 2. Suggesion - Time limit to participate in the pole shall be added.
You were updated more new features. Its good and easy to us. But my suggestion is you should to update that put a voice record option on whtsapp status. Please consider this also.
"I wonder why we can't send complete videos without sending them in bits,it's messed up,other apps permits sending video files complete,but this is wack."
"With the latest update, you can't select multiple files from the gallery to send. An update dropped today, and the problem wasn't solved."
"After the update, whenever I'm on mobile data, voice and video calls are on connecting stage Wifi calls connect but not when I'm on mobile data. Please help. Using OnePlus 10 pro."
"Once I have any voice massage from my contacts, I can't hear it because all voice massages include noisy tone in its background comes from the application itself."
"Whatever changes you made during the last upgrade yesterday, CHANGE IT BACK please. It's ridiculous to use now. Takes twice as long to send a message. Why have you done this? It's horrible."
"When wanting to share photos or videos, it is a massive inconvenience to select 1 by 1. Since the last update whatsapp almost doesn't want to keep my gallery accessible."
"Phone gets stuck, video gets choppy, and phone heats up since the latest update. No issues with video calling on other apps"
I really like the app it's secured gives you the opportunity to be in private no matter what the case is you can talk and chat and video to one another without interruption it's a good place to be thank you Google
I have not been able to open my WhatsApp. I uninstalled and downloaded it again and I can't still open it. Kindly look into this. I will be expecting your response. Thank you
"Access to gallery is BUGGED. Gallery is not showing up when trying to send photos. Please fix!!! Edit: anyone having those problem, check your app permissions"
AT&T is a new carrier I am with. Previous company was T-Mobile and they truly are people oriented at all. I am waiting to see how long it is going to take for AT&T to let me download my WhatsApp. I will see if there is a difference between these two companies.
"Latest update is terrible.... i especially hate it when it comes to sending pictures/videos, it only shows images that i have on whatsapp geoups only, doesnt have other pics, i need to open another gallery app to use it"
WhatsApp web was running nice in the Google chrome but from past two days my WhatsApp QR code is not scanning in the web. It stays still and no loading and etc. Very bad experience. Kindly fix it
When we are uploaded any images and videos in status. It's automatically blur and compress quality of images and videos. Please check and confirm once this issue resolve.
I sadly cannot access this app anymore. Everytime I try to login on my phone it's not working. Please fix this issue. I need to message my family and friends and I can't.
"The latest update of undo the messages, they appear on top after delete the recent chat or some unnecessary video for saving memory, the call taking too much time to connect."
"photos not there to attach. have to go to gallery and share from there rather than attaching from the app, all since the last update. what a shambles."
After the new update All my friends and family are getting the Instagram like stories on the profile pic...EXCEPT ME🤬 . I Can't understand wheather it is a glitch or what!! Solve it asap!!!!!!!!! In other cases whatsapp is ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"Since I've had an android update I can't send more then 1 photo at a time! And I've got to go around the houses to open my gallery just to find the photo to add and then send, useless!"
The best I always can stay in touch with others as long as I have internet connection highly recommended if you are always apart but want to get close this app is for you!
"I've been using whatsapp for a while now and ever since the last update, my profile picture(icon) and whatsapp bio(about) have been disappearing for no reason, I have no idea if it's just me it happening to, my privacy is fine"
Can you please add only owners can add people button. Edit: I'm loving the new avatar thing but I think you should make it look a bit less weird and add options where you can change shirt shoes seperatly.
Hats off to WhatsApp or Meta team for making this the default messaging app for everyone in India. Also thanks for not introducing annoying ads. I would give it the easiest 5 stars if u do one thing for us: ALLOW BUBBLE MESSAGES LIKE IN FACEBOOK MESSENGER. PLEASEE
"Other things are good but after the recent update the vedio calls are not up to the mark they lag , they donot connect early and with picture in picture mode they just seem to not working"
"This is a good app. In future, kindly consider screen sharing during video calls. I'm giving you 4 stars until you include that feature."
Though the last time I installed the app it been working well until suddenly I lost access to the streaming and down loading and senting of videos and I have not gotten it up till now I am still trying to get it on
"Hii team , how long can you take to fix the new bug in WhatsApp that whenever we are watching the others WhatsApp status when we suddenly enter back button still the status is playing in the background , it's a small bug to the WhatsApp team , but not resolved for somany days"
The new update is a disaster. I cannot see all my photos... Only certain folders are available.
The messages are not arranged chronologically. Causing a great deal of problem. The problem is happening since last week. Please solve!!
I don't like the fact that an image/video quality has to be compressed when uploading to status.... Developers you have to do something about that!
"Since the last update, I have to go to gallery to send photos which is annoying. I don't have permission to send from whatsapp photos like before. It needs to be fixed."
Plz add one feature where we can update our text send in messages or posted in status. It will help us a lot if we can edit the text messages as we sometime type wrong or miss something to write.
"In the last update it ""forces"" the user to give permenant location access!!! Why should I give it my current location access to be able to send any other locations on the map?!"
"Please, for the App developers and update team, make it possible to completely hide all status when U want to and turn it back on when you want to. There should be a tab that turns off the status view and back on when you want to"
"One humble request: More then boys are dislike tha blocked list option. First girls start the conversation after closing and every day chatting build the relationship and unforgettable memories . One day They are small fight she / he suddenly blocked, what's app is totally not use my mobile is not like it. To slow tha problem: Two members are Start with chatting,any one person request to ( remove Blocked list option ) if request accept not block for any time ,, else request not acceptin"
I am unable to receive OTP and having problems with authentication through both way via call me or sms as well if you people will can't resolve this issue so why you all are there no voice support no no chat support and even not recieved any response from email team however I have mail my whole issue with snap refrence
My number is getting blocked second time in a short period of time. I have no idea why it is getting blocked because I just use to send messages to my family and friends. Everytime they give reason of violating policy. Dont know which policy is getting violated in sending messages to family or friends.
Since the last update I no longer get the correct number of people who sent me message sometimes it just one person but the notification would be showing 3 messages from 3 people only for me to tap and see just 1 message
"Worst option that we getting problem with dissappearin after 24 hours, yesterday i closed the option and today option was opened automatically and all my sent documents were deleted, now i have only option to change app by deleting whatsapp from my phone, plz try to update till then bye, bye whatsaap"
"Doesn't work without update. Requires them again and again. There are no updates in the store already, but this still doesn't work without and asks for more updates... Boring"
"Since the latest update, can no longer send more than one photo at once, can not access the photo album direct any more, why, this is getting silly, updates that worsen the experiance. Running android 13 on a Samsung S21"
After these latest updates I have issues in putting status.. I have to go to gallery and share pictures and then edit..why I can't select it from WhatsApp itself?? Very bad experience
I want to complain about sharing messages and files. The restriction to share/forward messages. 5 people is not enough please look into these. I want to share message to all my 375 contacts but I can't because it'd be tiresome. 5×75=375. Do I have to repeat the same thing 75 times?
Ayy WhatsApp bruv...your app is dope. But i wonder what it would be like if i had the option to change peoples profile pictures on my side while they keep theirs the same...you think that is possible...i wouldnt mind another update
Undoubtedly one of the most used app on any device. I think whatsapp should integrate the samsung keyboard stickers like the way they did with gboard.
"Its best app for communication , i just want to request one thing, can u add extra min in status time, 30sec r so less for 1 min video and we have to cut post the video."
Keeps crashing after latest update on 17 Dec 2022. Have reinstalled 7 times and just keeps crashing. All software of phone are upto date only WA keeps crashing. Tired.
Terrible after last update - when replying to specific message whole conversation goes down so you need to scroll up to get to the starting point - no longer can reply to deleted messages I am looking for other apps to replace whatsapp
This version is there some problems which was having not works popup notifications and it doesn't work typing keyboard while coming notifications.
Latest update is the worst. Not able to send multiple photos from gallery. Also gallery needs to be accessed using three dots in camera. How to downgrade to previous version ?
"I am facing an issue since many days... Some videos not downloading.. They are not too much lengthy, at least 30 seconds but not completely download... Again n again failed to download... Why is this issue ."
"Bad 😞 very bad service. Since last month. It neenda every single day restarting again and again why? I am disturbed and my chat backup,my messages didn't get back? I never face this problem.Improve your service so that I connect better to my people."
"You know, it'll be nice if Whatsapp had like a hibernation feature, where you just disappear from Whatsapp for a period of designated time and be back when the time elapses. It'll help for addiction control and stuff."
The change to the photo gallery is a major step backwards. The inability to select multiple pictures from my gallery is a major drawback.
"The latest update messed up the sort order of chats. Now, when the last messages in a chat are deleted, said chat still stays stuck among the recent chats even though it no longer contains any recent messages."
"Excellent app to communicate among all ur people, it has diversity 👍 and no glitches that I've noticed, only when internet signal is low. Very secure($afe)!!!!"
Please sort out the issue with only being able to view images already on WhatsApp when opening the gallery to send a photo. I now have to go into my phone gallery and select share via WhatsApp in order to send new photos
"With recent update now frequent peoples are showing in first stage of messenger even after deleted messages, that person name still showing Top of the table. please fixed this bug."
"The latest update doesn't allow me to post the most recent pictures on my profile picture, nor does it show them. I have to take a picture via WhatsApp which is frustrating."
This update is so bad.. The app doesn't show complete album resorting to choose from default gallery app. Everytime
I actually didn't understand the need of new feature in Whatsapp .I mean you can directly go and see status and what is the need of able to see it alongwith dp. It's actually annoying
"Good...... But could be the best if it has feature like auto reply, business description, and other useful features.unable to backup chats which is the most important thing"
"Make it easy like telegram so when one re install it(WhatsApp app) and sign in,get all messages and contacts without ur difficulties of chat back up which is messy and others."
This app is good but i hate the fact that i cant find any pics from my gallery because whatsapp doesn't show. I have to go to my gallery to share pics and whats worse is that i cant 30 pics or more.. I will keep giving 1 star until this problem is solved!
"This should come as a WARNING more than a comment. I just found out from my mobile carrier that Whatsapp charged $95 to my account for a 25 minute international call. Be aware. Call your carrier and ask them to block these charges. You'll still be able to use the app, but won't fall prey to Zuckerberg's scam."
Recent updates is worst of all the time Lot of bugs are there . When I open the profile of the person it shows the status of the person what he has put . It's really irritating .
"After this update the what's app, I can't select photo from gallery more than 1 photo , if possible u can fix this bug . It will help to many user like me !"
when during my last update.my whatapp pop up nofication tone were not working.it totally silent. and it said my android version it not available on pop out nofication..please fix this.it hard to know when we received and text from our employee or important workflows
You received a message but your version of whatsapp doesn't support it. I have WhatsApp updated to the latest version. Great messaging app that does not load messages...
I have deleted a contact from contact book and saved with another name but still it is showing with old name in WhatsApp. I have refreshed new contacts in whatsapp multiple times but it is showing old name and new name both. Message and status is still appearing with old name. How can I fix it?
Recent update is hell.....😳 Can't hear my own audio.... Same as WhatsApp voice call....... This issue is from the app not my phone....I've tried other applications....get it fixed...
"It's takes up lot of space , l can't send my picture to people without having to go through ads needs to be fixed but otherwise it's good to use 🌍❤️🙃"
I have downloaded this app then it's telling me to scan the QR code with another phone when I did it all the chats from my phone went to this one when I tried deleting the contacts it was deleting from my phone and now we are sharing the whatsapp we can't even have our own privacy whyyyyyy
"Hello, this app is actually very good, BUT there is 1 problem. We. Need. Screen. Showing. Like, when u talk to a friend, and he wanna show u something, he cant show it. Thats the problem😭"
"Very well app for communication, I just wished we were allowed to change the emoji style because they are different from the default and some of them are very ugly"
"Love the app, but getting an extremely annoying glitch : black screen, for no reason. When it happens, the only solution is to reboot my phone. Why ?!"
I am looking for a option where I can import chat of any particular option if the chats are exported. There should be provision for the same as we have a option for export.
Can you please hide the muted videos forever. And this message is deleted notification. These are really irritating. Otherwise great app.
"For a week now, i'll have to restart my phone before i receive and get to send just whatsapp messages, every other app works fine... i'd like to know why this is happening..."
"Why do I have to open app before I see the new messages in this new version?? What happened to NOTIFICATIONS??? SUPPORT PLEASE FIX THIS, instead I only get the option of popup notifications with full messages, who does that"
"Restore the old version where i can install whatsapp on my tab, i've read that since tablet don't have an active 'sim card', whatsapp cannot be install on a tab cause it needs an active phone number. My tab have an active sim card as well as an active phone number, still i cant install whatsapp on my tab. Fix this issue please."
Updated version is not at all good. Even the deleted chats are appearing at the top . Nd status opens when we click on profile pic🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️.
"This new version is bad, I downloaded a photo that was sent by a friend but I couldn't find it in any of my gallery, it's so so painful please kindly take me back to the previous version thank you 🙏"
I seem to be that this app is a great for all purpose such as personal conversation as well as business I am using this app for a Long time but I have no faced any kind of problem and terrible until today. It's Best app .
"After update, Video call problem is coming oftentimes. When I trying to cut the call , it wasn't cut . If the opposite person cut off , then could be only cut ."
"After the December 2022 update on my samsung FE S20, I have WhatsApp crashing problem. The app crashes right after I open it. I have cleared cache and even after that it is crashing. Please resolve the problem immediately."
"Well after the update, unable to add stickers, stickers disappears, unable to backup media while backing up messages, and app crash"
"Not good after update, my phone is z fold 4, i cant select more than one photo after update from gallery though whats app. I have to first open gallery and then select the contact i want to send to."
Not sure what happened suddenly i am unable to connect Galaxybuds pro while using whatsapp call. Only time i can connect is before making call in whatsapp if my buds are connected already then it stays connected or else i cant connect.
"It would be great if there was a built-in feature that allowed the user to tag everyone in a group instantly, or to tag multiple people without having to type the @ symbol over and over again."
Yhyh WhatsApp is really improving and that's nice......but I have a suggestion Won't it be awesome if we could post voice notes on our status instead of writing long messages or using screen records
"When a message is deleted from a chat, it remains in the same place at the top as if it had not been deleted. Two days ago an em was deleted a message and automatically scrolled down to the date of the last message in that chat. It was better as it was."
The ability to send message to yourself is a very nice update. I like this especially when I want to keep an information to myself. Great idea from WhatsApp.
Facepalm. Your backup system is easy yet complex. Now I have to wait 8 hours. Yes. This is my very first time using an Android backup of WhatsApp. 🙄
"i use whatsapp to talk to family and friends, and its been great but lately my messages aren't being delivered (even though my sister in the same room can send messages just fine).. my phone is samsung s21, could u pls do an update or something 😩"
"Latest update changed the image attachment feature. Now even to send screenshots, i have to open the gallery app."
WhatsApp is an excellent messaging app. But it takes too much space unlike Telegram that uses less than 400mb of space on my device. Please do something about it.
"Everything is great bt while doing video call, the call isn't minimising in a small tab....all settings are on bt it just not working.... please help."
When upload for status pictures are blur even though the pics where compressed and uploaded need to be fixed. Very worst app.
"After recent update when viewing the status, the song of the video is continuously playing even when that status is no loger viewing oand even when in chat until you exit whatsapp and delete it from recently opened apps"
"there is alot of problems with this app, still not working good, messages are not sending, when someone calls it doesn't ring but it show you later that you missed calls"
"It would highly appreciate able that If anyone not use any longer WhatsApp which number it's WhatsApp registered then other(contacts person)can easily get it that the person is no longer use the WhatsApp(which WhatsApp number contact person have).. Coz, WhatsApp shows the last seen on the date though the person already uninstall it.. And open it with a new number that Contact person can never know this.. Plz update it.."
After the recent update whenever i am delete any chat from delete from me the chat still is pinned at top and the call experience is also no so good sometimes either the video does work or the mic doesn't work Its a request to check the updates pls
I will give it onestar coz its has already tested my patience. You are a ver bad app especially that whenever i click on it just instruct me to delete other apps and photos before use though that does not give me enough reason not to recommend it to any one else .just try your luck
"Thanks. Experience has been all good. Since, I have deleted an unwanted number of an individual from my WhattsApp a day ago. Early this morning the individual is back in my face with a message. How can this be. What's up ???"
Please correct the text in the About App section. It is written: It’s used by over 2B people in more than 180 countries. 😁Over 28 people???? A typo error 😀
"I love it, it's useful, fast, convenient and reliable. I wish you had a short video dp setting, like gif"
"After latest update While making video calls, call gets stuck regularly after 5-10 minutes. And then call gets disconnected showing some error messages. Kindly check"
The app keeps stoping every time its really annoying please fix this app plus the most terrible part is that it hungs alot when chatting and doesnt allow you to post anything on your status it just says sending 😠
"To continue using WhatsApp, the following features must be added: voice changer - converting voice into text - topics in groups - modifying sent messages. This is enough."
"Past two months WhatsApp has been banning my account for no reason. It's pathetic when you have to inconvenience and cut my communication for no valid reason. If you are seeing the spam from your end which I can't see, sort it out or warn and advise me with evidence. Otherwise you are 🤮🤮🤮🤮"
"Maybe you can add a new fitur repost a story. It's like if a friends post a photo story with several people, so he can tagged his friends and his friends could repost it by one click without any screenshot"
"Ny app is hanged when was listening the audio file in whatsapp. Somtime when i watching the status videos, the video us not showing but audio is played well"
"Restoration of the backed up data process is just full of glitches. Thanks Whatsapp, i lost my all backed up data. Thanks a lot, for losing 3 years of data."
"This is a very good app, but only the numbers added in the mobile in the message settings can send messages, if such an update is added, it can be better."
When we add videos to status it may get slow and the video may get damage like I edited a video for a beautiful beat but when I added to my status the beats where misplaced so just update that one topic
"doesnt play videos for me (samsuns M32) I checked- my internet connection, permission from settings and in the app but it still doesnt work, it used to work before but now doesn't and i don't know why"
Excellent multimedia system. It's only limited by narrow band internet/Wi-Fi in developing countries.
"Please fix your chat backup option, even if user has selected monthly backup option. It shows a notification of preparing backup on the daily basis and this is so annoying."
"New version, we delete the message or photo, msg not set old day and its showing recent chat. And photo also sending its very difficult."
I am not very happy because my query wasn't resolved. I kept on providing clear details but time and again the responses were literally the same. Responses provided were irrelevant and not helpful. I am extremely disappointed with Wattsapp and Meta
"Today My one group is not openining, as soon as I touch on group Whatsapp crashing. Please fix this error. That is my educational group. Pop up message said this app has a bug. Please"
After last few updates i hate this update of not able to see when someone is online this just feels like talking to robot when you dont know other one is online too much privacy is too much . Just remove this feature.
"I love the most update on Whatsapp. But could I suggest one thing. For the status reply, can we have the button to on AND off? Sometimes I just want to post without getting reply, you know just want to update the I am still alive but no distractions afterwards."
"After this update I can't change my profile photo or send recent photos because it doesn't recognize them. please fix it, it's frustrating"
Required auto set Date conversation . .. Earlier it's working but after update Whatsap it's not working.. i. e. I delete today's conversation then that people chat showing in there today's conversation not go down their original last conversation
"I cant send pictures from my gallery anymore, only those from the WhatsApp gallery. This has been going on for a while now and they better fix it soon"
Since update on my Samsung phone I can't get WhatsApp pop up notifications. Being deaf it's important to me to see my phone has a call as I don't hear it. Please sort it out to put back pop up notifications please
After update is hard to find latest picture. Edited. Tq so much support team. Its easy just change setting. Apps > whatsapp > video/pics > Allow 🥰😆 I hope anyone have same my problem can try this 💗
After update if I'm going to upload any image and video or screenshot recent photos video are not visible in the gallery.this is a bug i think so which came after updation.
"Total trash now not only does it no longer allow me to share any pictures in the gallery aside from WhatsApp pictures, it compresses the gallery pics (ie screenshots) to the point it's unviewable"
"New update is very usless version... So not current update photos, videos, and file it is important bugs very problem not satisfied this version. Please kindly update immediately."
we are lossing time and MBs for this system of uptading every now and then and secondly we used to send to as many contacts you select but nowadays only stricted to 5 fix for us these issues please. ----------------------------- my dearest good brothers and sisters help me with this my whatsapp i have been with it many years and i am one of your great grand customers there were a time they said to had stopped it by mistake and i was happy getting it back so if there were any mistake frgve
"It's okay. Buh, I've been finding it difficult to switch on my flashlight during video call.🙄🙄 I don't know if it's my phone.🤨 Buh It definitely not😑"
"I think Mr.Marker zukerberg doesn't have enough money to install harddisk storage while uploading WhatsApp video status no clarity at all very cheap cheap clarity.. whatsapp automatically compressing in to very very cheap quality....one idea i will recommend to u, please remove status uploading option or else provide good compression program....."
WhatsApp is finally doing it for android The only thing now is to make the WhatsApp interface and settings like the iphones And also the viewing of status and profile picture option isn't there so that also should be done properly...I gige you 5 star cause I know it will be done 👍
"I have given it 4 stars because whatsapp is becoming good and I request users who are developing it , should provide us facility to do voice call in more than 15 participants. Now please bring new update of whatsapp ..and most important that we can share file upto 3-4gb"
just how much i hate tablets nes update. linked two device. i want tablet whatsapp work as my phone. I lost my whatsapp due to it. cant retrieve because my number has been terminated. cant recover. seriously how much i wish people would go for telegram or any massenger app.
Since the last update I can't reply to people's statuses. The message and send bar are not visible and I am not going to play guessing games. Please fix this
Experience is so good nowadays..i wanted to give it 3 stars but one more thing i expect from app it's a locked and hidden messages option it will more help us... I wish you will do it so early
"My chat dates constantly keep changing! Sometimes to 1999, sometimes 2013 and sometimes a few days in the future! My phone date is correct tho, please help me fix it"
It is very convenient to use this apps for personal or message. Will be good if edit contact can be buildin similar to new contact that bringup contact apps automatically
"It has a problem. cannot send a file directly, you have to copy the file in specificf folder and then try for sending."
"Seems like the latest update doesnt want to use my main mic for audio msges, it seems to be using the secondary mic instead, my audio msges are very muffled and not clear as before"
"After the last update ,I dont like this at all because if we are deleting some messages of any person the name of the person is still showing on the top. ... Please replace this system by earlier system."
The reason I gave it a three was because it takes forever to log in once you use one of your backups it doesn't show me the entire messages I hope you can fix this PROBLEM
"It says u must update whatsappp to see a view once the photo, but my whatsupp is updated, and it is only for one contact. The rest of my contacts work fine."
I think it would be good if there was a button to scroll to the top instantly like in the bottom right corner have one pointing up so you don't have to scroll for ages in a big group chat
Verification is very difficult to get through. Why does it ask to wait for hours? Whatsapp is becoming worst now a days. Telegram and signal are the best social media app when compared to whatsapp 💯💯💯
"WhatsApp pls improve your phone call it lagging, echoing it bad i can't even call some people properly and it's not with my phone cus i tried it with a friend it's form the app not from the phone pls fix the audio and stop it from lagging and echoing ty."
After an update the camera roll is no longer accessible. Makes sending photos infinitely more difficult
"New update bugs After the new update you can't select more than one picture at a time , certains pictures in the phone memory can't be located and I can't upload or send videos ."
"I love to use whatsapp and it helps me in several way like to speak with my friend or family and it the only way I can make my self to be comfortable and be happy all the time I use it, no any apps I love more than whatsapp is my favorites app And I want to login in my account to be come a part of people who are using the Apps and please I won't it back and I will follow the rules and regulations or the law guide it, and this account means a lot to me in using it, is my favorite application I ."
"Well , recent update of WhatsApp about ' Message you self ' and ' AVATAR ' . is good but I have a suggestion that you should include more Indian culture outfit in avatr creation . So that many girls or women are from different states. Personally I request you to also add MARATHI SAREE outfit too."
When I connected to wifi and i placed vedio and audio call the network gets slow on the other hand when I connect to mobile data the call running so smooth plz remove this bug .
What a tedious upgrade. Sharing an image has become a major pain in the butt. Earlier the most recent pic was extremely easy to share. Now you have to go through a thousand steps to share the image
"Why not add an editing option for written status? I like the new features and all but it would be cool if, let say I write a post and I made a typo error, I can just edit or modify without deleting and reposting."
suddenly it started showing restoring messages screen and unable to restore even after having a backup.. Worst experience!
The worst experience after this update..... Local folders are Not showing directly..... I can't select more than 1 Picture at a Time..... Disappointed
There should be an option of blocking multiple people at a time. Messages are kept on seen.. Even if you unread it What is the use of the feature mark as unread then?
"the application say i didn't need to update, but why tf i couldn't click a react at my mssg as before i've did? it doesn't look like that but it changed. I even couldn't click forward in a normal mode."
"Latest update moved the whatsapp folder into Android/Media/com.whatsapp/ folder. Thus, the media do not show up in gallery images."
I'm having an issue. I can't see polls. I updated my WhatsApp but still it shows this message is not supported by your current version
Worst experience this week Lost all data even uploaded Pop up screen appeared and asked to restore. And I clicked to restore it runs for so long and then lost everything Worst App
"Feture of direct calling from phone has been disapeared after recent update.. now we can only call numbers on whats app with this ridiculus update... now we have to copy number first from whats app and then go to phone app and thn we can call... 😫 , Please fix this issue..."
Please add a feature on the group were admins can pin a certain message. And also a feature were U can schedule a text to send automatically at a certain time. 🙏
"Why i cant attach photos from Phone gallery directly like before, instead i have to click Gallery tab (which also not existed any photos from Phone gallery but only have WhatsApp photos), and then hv to click the 3 dots on the top right and choose Gallery option in the 3 dots?"
Just need to use because everyone are using it. Just to share pictures and videos. Not much exciting like before. Collecting sensitive data.
All of a sudden it started saying this account can't use WhatsApp and I didn't go against the terms of service ever since I downloaded the update it started doing this please fix I don't wanna have to get a new sim
"Whatsapp doesn't save received photos to my gallery. And folder named ""WhatsApp images"" just disappeared. I didn't change nothing and touch nothing"
The one time seen mode it's should be back as normal where people can take screen shots or else it's not worth ...i do not invade anyone's privacy but But i personally don't like that feature
Uploading audio from the attachment icon then choosing audio crashes WhatsApp. Please look into with urgency. Thanks
"Very Helpful for Documents share! Very Important App For video call, chats many useful in work! It's help in covid cases distance relationship, family to connect with us! 🙏💐"
It's really a shame that after this much success you guys didn't add option to download all media in sdcard. Think about users who have le internal storage
"After recent update, if i delete some chat, it's still showing the name in the list at top, rather than moving at bottom or old location. This is violating the privacy. Pl rectify this"
"Since last update when I delete a message from a chat, the chat with this person still appears on the same position. So date sorting of messages is wrong."
Photos I have recieved are to blurred to see. Videos wont play. With image to start the videos is very blurred.
"The app is malfunctioning It's making video calls on it's own, the chat minimises and audios are sent automatically even before the time limit"
Since the update i can only select pics sent by whats app Cant select photo from google photos for my display picture and if share them have to go in to google photos as dont use gallery i use google photos Great app keep in touch call ur friends or message send pics with friends use a profile pic for ur profile main problem is auto saving pictures when u tell the app not to i get fed up-of having to manually delete pics sent from my mates
"I have a problem with Whatsapp. The videos I post on my Whatsapp status are not playing. Fix this problem immediately, I can't view status video from my contacts. I am so disappointed 😞 😔 😪. Fix this 😑 😒 😪 😔 😞"
Attaching files from Gallery now seems near to impossible as Albums are not showing properly. Plz solve the issue.
There is an issue on the poll. A person who wishes to choose all the options given in the question can selected all. Which is not suitable for multiple choice questions
"Why would you try to fix something that wasn't broken to begin with. The gallery access problem is frustrating, to say the least. Now, FIX it!"
"The last update practically eradicated the option for me to send pics. When I pull up the attachment, it will only show what I've sent before."
"Why are local SIMs closed while talking on WhatsApp? The calls of those who call locally are very important. So, local calls should actually be disconnected on WhatsApp.... SIM call are very important"
Why the device is vibrating with every image taken via whtsapp camera option. Whereas with normal camera it doesn't. Explored all features & settings but no help.
"In recent update, I'm unable to attach my camera pics, I have to go to gallery and share photos from gallery, I'm using multiple whatsapp accounts in same phone, I'm unable to view photos of my photo gallery which is clicked by me, and also I'm unable to see whatsapp received pictures in my gallery for my first whatsapp account."
"After the latest update I can't access the screenshot images directly in the chat, PLEASE BRING IT BACK. And provide the option to forward the file without downloading."
Please fix this quickly as possible! When we send a message it's not sending to the person is type unless they open the app I hate this please fix this as soon as possible please
On trying to open WhatsApp with my new device. I've put in the SIM card but can't receive the code. For now I'm using WhatsApp in my old phone without a SIM card. Why can't you send the code to the number that requested it? Should I continue using WhatsApp in my old phone without a SIM? Should I delete this one?
Currently i do not have a WhatsApp folder in my gallery it just dissappeared when i did the latest update....whats going on with you guys???? Its now very complicated accessing photos sent over WhatsApp
"Past week, messages take over 10 minutes to get to you or will only tell/reach you when you open the app. Doesn't notify you when someone calls you on WhatsApp, just tells you that you have missed a call 5 seconds later."
"Appreciating the team for introducing self text feature. Facing issue with video calls, inconsistent and frequent disconnection"
"It's a great app that stopped working and I did not know why. With some help, I updated it and now all ok. Why did this excellent app not tell me to update instead of failing?"
"Best app for communication ever! Just wish the app would allow people to schedule messages, specially for the people that use the app for work."
"Good day and well done for the update, I can call you litnener developer, kudos 👏 👍. Presently, I still need more developing on whatsapp group like, when new members added he/she can be viewe at least not less than 20 past posts. That can give clues or ideas of what group is all about. Thanks and expecting more futures."
"The new feature about chatting to you is nice but that should have reminder as well, like I saved certain commitment at 10.00, it should alarm me at 10.00, it would have been better"
"I absolute love this app, now I have convinced my sister to install the app on her phone. She addicted to it and now we send each pictures, we talk, we message everyday. Thank you WhatsApp. 😊"
"When viewing the status, click on the profile and after selecting the profile picture, when viewing a different status, the status song of the person whose profile is opened Plays in the background. Please solve the bug....."
"I cant even rate it now The last update is really frustrating you have to go back to your gallery for you to update your photos ,some status updates don't even open please fix this bug or whatever it is"
I have been having problems with the attachments . I had to try multiple times before I was able to send a single document to someone . Please assist on That.
it's really good experience with wa. now new update of wa is too secure and good communication. lunch New settings which is like pro. i love it.
"Give the option of going completely incognito so someone can type and be online without being shown as online to other contacts. Once this is done, you will get 6 stars!"
Had a good experience so farr nice app I have ever seen😇 I juszt love using this app. This app is my favourite one so farr. I just loving the new updates of the app. Especially the new options like poll and messaging ourselves were too good 👍
"Good app. 1 problem. When I tried to change my phone number because I got a new one, I need a cancel button to cancel the registration. Please put it as soon as possible. I can not message my family now."
App sends unnecessary and unwanted messages and interrupts my cellphone service at random times! This is a very damaging practice! Please stop doing this!
"On video call whenever other person mute the call, it shows on middle of the screen which irritates. Please fix it or drag it to corner of the screen."
Hi. I have problem with my What's apps grom time to time.Please help me find solution to this because it affects my business. My what's app is not working now.l am compelled to download and remove a lot of info from my phone.
"After last update.. I am not able to open my photos, video and not able to see the status."
Ready to go back to Trinidad and Tobago. Such great memories. Was just talking to Annette Lewis about when the borders over there was going to open.
"There should be more features whether you take premium for this like how many times a person opened a chat, If someone tried to type something but not sended any text etc."
"The last update was best again you guys updated it and put ""XYZ is muted call"" guys really ??we dont really need these type of thing i mean when u are on video call it show on center Middle of the screen....just purly annoying....plzzz small thing need to fix it please"
Chats are no longer appearing in chronological order. It's very frustrating. Pl fix it asap.
"Since the last update, I have not been able to share photos collection with friends or family, and I am so annoying with it now as I have tried so many different ways to fix it. Please fix this issue"
I am giving it 4 stars because I want some changes like shorts video just like reels In Facebook and Instagram shorts in YouTube. If there will be some changes which I have mentioned it will be very good and effective.
WhatsApp is a good app that allows family and friends interact very well. It's make's it easer for family that are not close.
Top rated app... But live location tracking is very very very very worst..... Today is an emergency morning... Can't track live location.... Even single star is also not worth...
Can we have an option where it allows you to view a sticker before you get to tap send .?! Otherwise..A great App!
I Have 3 android devices two mobile phones and one tablet.... I cant use my whatsapp in all of my devices at same time which is hell bcz my friends have my one number and when switching between devices this make horrible foe me....... hope whatsapp will fix this soon...
After update latest version i unable to attach multiple photo and unable to access my gallery photo album. I need to attach one by one and repeat and repeat again. Is time consuming
Hate the program . It is not clear. Fix it you know when something works you don't add a lot of stuff that ruins it. I lost two hours trying to just figure things out! Terrible hard whatscap
Nice app and update features... But i ll love to see mute conversation feature in group chat. Such that you can stop seeing message coming from a member of a group.
"although my phones date it correct my WhatsApp shows my contacts last seen completely wrong... it shows 2008 date , it's really annoying i tried resetting my phone's date and restarting my phone nothing helped unfortunately 👎👎👎"
"I like everything about WhatsApp except that it should let you edit your text messages, sending more messages just to correct your message I personally don't like it"
Unable to sharemore than one file or image at one time via mail or any other app other than whatsapp Selecting two images then if I want it to share via mail there is no option But if I select one image and share it via mail it gets send
"Pretty good app use it for my school and daily life, sometimes the call may be a little glitchy and when i open the app it says fingerprint denied but i haven't even put my finger on the sensor other than that the app is good"
"Needs proper tablet ui, I use it on tab s7 as an phone extension, but the app doesn't look optimized, windows app layout would fit just fine"
"Cannot set backups. Asks me for an email account. When I enter it it keeps telling me "" this email account already exist"".....so cannot back up any chats daily weekly or monthly."
"Extremely horrible , i lost all my messages till 1st September and all the media, videos all my messages on any contact or group...Even did all the steps which WhatsApp official support account said but nothing works at all"
"Please let WhatsApp include the option of seeking ones consent before adding one to a group. Scammers will just create group and start adding people. Please, make it in such a way that no adding of someone to a group without his or her consent in your next upgrade. Thank you."
You guys should fix the problem of turning the backup setting😒bcz I turned mine off and it still carries on saying that something went wrong with your whatsapp chat history ...like bruh😡🤬😠and then it deletes my messages I turned it off but still continues to do that😠
The way whatsapp taking care of our privacy is really appreciable. End to end encryption is one step ahead in this safety. I am rating you full because of this and also the quality you maintain. Thanks
"Please add separate options for 'who can see me when I am online' like my contacts ,etc. Don't mix the options of last seen and online. Give all separate for last seen and all separate options for online."
"Application is very popular and useful, but any other number that means any number, which is not saved my contact, send me WhatsApp.. kindly change this feature..... it's very important......"
"for some reason after the update i get a message on my linked watch saying.. you have a WhatsApp message, see on phone for message??? what's the point of just telling me! just show me said message as usual!! i sometimes don't carry my phone so this is now no good at all to me!!! thanks..... not!!!"
"The Best and fastest Access Link in communicating with all other groups and famy or friends. With Voicemail or Video, chatting is so wonderful and I really give 🎉 Congrats 🎉 to the creator of Whatsapp for quick Message and chatting 🤗, surely to Success 👏🏼💕"
Why don't whatsapp brings restrict option like Instagram. If we don't want to hear from someone we could restrict them instead of blocking. This will be very good if it is introduced.
This app was once good when i started using it but for the past few months i have not been able to use whatsapp due to spam I have been requesting review but you guys are not helping me at all and it is affecting me seriously both academically that is why i cant rate this app
Great app to use whatever country you are in. Able to stay in touch with home no matter where you are. Love the option for group chats & phone or video calls
I lost all my chats even i have backup in my google drive and it is showing that no backup found. The worst thing can happen to you is you lost all your contacts and chats even if you have that
It is quite fair to use this app. But sometimes i feel like it is letting me down because you can't communicate well with people of far distant isles.
Some photos and videos are not showing in gallery. Even media visibility of WhatsApp and the person who send is also on. I don't find any solution even on YouTube. Please solve this issue .
"Even after deleting a particular message, the chat doesn't go back to the date of the last message fr this update. It's really annoying"
The new version off WhatsApp is awesome but I have just one regret that is just add birthday notification in that. So it can easy to remember and wish to our loved once.
Latest update has many problems now.... One that annoyed me the most is that after deleting a chat it doesn't go to its previous place and stay up top please solve this problem it's bugging me a lot😫😫
"What's with the vibration everytime I change to status-calls-messages, and then scrolling through the contacts, and then vibrates hardest when I click on search like???"
Deleted recent conversations but the chat dont want to move down (time sorted). I also muted some people but their notifications still pop sometimes.
If only whatsapp can give optional to store all the downloaddd media to the external storage instead of phone storage to reduce the amount of storage usage in the phone memory that would better and maybe i will consider to give 5 star for it. :)
Whatsup has blocked my personal whatsup no without my mistake i was very old user of whatsup even i have not broken any guidlines of whatsup even i have already send request review and chat them but no use. they have not restore my service.very disappointed with management better i have decided switch to other alternative app.
After recent update i am not able to view all albums in my gallery and also i am not able to change my profile picture. Please fix it.🙏
"Love this app, especially video calling. Keeping my fingers crossed FB doesn't screw it up and bring a ton of ads."
"Tbh I think it would be better if the app had animated stickers with the avatars u can crate there👹. Plus when u create the avatar there are no curly hairs that aren't afro, they tried to be inclusive but it ended up the other way around 😒"
The app is good and useful but I don't like the fact that you can't delete contacts from it That feature please needs to be added.
"Easy and simple to use, I'm sure we all enjoy all free calls, video calls, and texts message. This app makes it easy to stay in contact with your family."
"this is an amazing app..... there should be 1 thing that the team should add in it.... the ""only share with"" option in profile photo📷 setting.. 🥰🙏"
"I like WhatsApp and all but,I'm only giving it a four star because I updated the app to the latest and it still told me my app was out of date causing me not to be able to open some pictures sent to me,pls fix this"
"The new updates were all good and fine until I saw the picture quality I am updating, either as status or dp. The quality is hell poor😑 Almost blurry. Please fix that ASAP🙏"
"What's happened to posting pictures from my phones Gallery?? It used to be so easy, now it's a nightmare! Great upgrade guys!"
Its amazing but sometimes when u send a message it comes up witha clock instead of the ticks.Thats just happened as of now...Overall its amazing but please fix that bug its highly annoying and now ive had to uninstall and reinstall i hope my chats come back and it works still... 🤞🏼 it doesnt work now says cant login please try in 5 mins please answer back so i know what to do
It's a shame such a huge organization and so many pathetic mistake... Not able to back up chats.... It's a big shame so. Many advertisment and services are the most poor ones.
"After the new update, I am unable to attach & send the photos from my camera to a watsapp chat!!! I can only send after going to the photo gallery!"
What do you mena popup notifications are no longer available in my android version?! Mine is up to date. I've been using it that feature fr a long time and nw this??????
Small suggestion. It will be helpful if meta adds note function to make notes if anything is urgent so we can quickly instead of depending on any colornote app
The screen's touch isn't working properly while speaking in whatsapp video call. Down right side of the screen is facing issue at the time of video chat. WhatsApp is becoming worse than ever
"No message editing, no scheduling, no bots, no real file transfers, no lossless media and useless without a phone.."
I am not able to complete the chat backup. Every time it get stuck on 99% irrespective of what internet speed I have. It shouldn't happen. Fix it.
Last update has unlinked the ability to select camera pictures. Have to go into 3 dots etc....review as others below...please fix
The gallery is not getting updated with the new photos and videos. keeps showing me a 2 week old gallery items. i have to go to gallery to send it via WhatsApp
Overall experience is good but when I send images through WhatsApp it reduces the original picture quality and it becomes blurry.
"Very bad update, if you want to share a media from gallery that will require more effort to send it , you have to do more steps to can achieve your gallery inside the app"
The recent update is not at all good. I can find any difference between Instagram and WhatsApp. For viewing the status from the status coloum was better in WhatsApp.
Old whtapps is good please again this whtapps is a very complicated.... If you have to changed whtapps features then showing the online... Who person has been online... Telegram they are showing the online person ...
It is like WhatsApp have stupid programmers or the company does not care about its users. Why you can't simply install the app on your iphone and restore the backup from your android? Why you need to use an extra application? Why you need to reset your phone to factory settings? It's just stupid. I don't even understand why so many are using this app. They are fooled by marketing into using this poor app instead of others much much better.
This app is not working properly.. I have tried a lot to login my account again but all in vain . I am highly disappointed.. It used to work so well but now I don't know what's the issue ?.
"Recently from past 2 weeks whatsapp is getting hanged , video call is not working properly , software is up to date only."
"After this update, my video as well as photoes is not downloading. If any body send any photo so I am unable to see that photo. please solve this problem."
Uh everyone's got the same issue but like where are my photos- I can only send pictures friends have sent I mean yes I can click the 3 dots to get to my gallery but cannot even send my videos since they don't even pop up-
"Qualities of video call in WhatsApp should be improve while talking to anyone I faced many problems like video quality,is very bad and some time sound also not clear. Please WhatsApp improve the quality of video calling"
Quite on the simple side...latest updated features are nice but Whatsapp should also create a feature whereby a deleted message can be seen... Thanks
Whats app is a great app for keeping in touch with family & friends worlwide. Its very easy to use & is very a fun app. Suitable for all ages
I don't like the new features 😕 I can't see anyone profile whenever I used to see the profile automatically the status come. Thank you
My friend reporting me again and again i frustrate from this process to resign sometimes OTP also not come It is worst communication that i ever seen my account is banning without any reason i give review i also search in help menu but there us not option to fix it i will give -5 star but it is not possible and waiting for 12 hours or 24 hours to re-login i am trying this for almost 1 months please fix this if without reason someone report me
I can't see my contact names in WhatsApp even I already allowed my phone contact .. I'm using this app for about 3 and half years now ... And now it is not showing contact names .. only few
"I saw a new feature and used it once then it disappeared. When sending camera photo within a chat it was giving option of taking a video too, that is without holding camera button to record. Was it removed? Can't find it now."
This app gives me all the time to chat with my friends and Limited cheating time and all of that and I really liked it so if you guys don't like this we should start getting those around them wanting all your s*** stuff
"After recent update contacts in chat are not aligning in datewise order. i.e. if you deleted today's messages contact remains at same place, not moving to yesterday's chat contact order."
"Time changed after update I updated app to newer version, but date is complex, my text write in 2017, when other friend send message write today but the message going to the last row of chat list, my top message date is 2028😳"
Pictures quality while sharing becomes very bad. Story pictures quality also very bad . You should fix it. The last update is worst!
Watsapp has been draining my phone's battery (One Plus 10r) so much that it is using 90% of my phone's battery. Too much power consumption from a single app.
"After the new update , I'm not be able to do video call picture in picture mode. 🤬. Day by day it's getting worse. I wanna give it -5 ⭐. Don't download anybody."
Nowadays the photos on status uploads in so much low quality that it just looks blur even if the photo taken has good quality...so bad experience...pls fix it
"After updation, unable to type the status as much as required, as it has been limited to 700 characters. Getting worse day by day."
"Numbers in phone contact cant be sync with contact in whatsapp number ... profile picture have bugged, always disappear whenever refresh or change new one... please fix.. app kinda problem after latest update"
I'm unable to create my whatsApp.. I had uninstall whatsApp and now I'm try from previous 3 days to open whatsApp with same no. No sms Or call are sending on my no. (Too many attempts) just this is showing please help me
Best app to use no doubt but i have a issue This new update doesn't show recent images like screenshot and images from snapchat to share to contacts..need to go all the way to gallery to share those..pls fix it
"Hello WhatsApp Developers, please increase the number of logins with linked devices. We do office work and Whatsapp can be only linked with 4 devices. Please increase this facility to atleast 8 logins. Thanks"
Terrible update spoken to whatsapp support to get help but they just blame my device and my device is a new update one so isn't that as whatsapp worked before I only get notifications when I open the app and apparently notifications are blocked since new update
"New update doesn't allow me to click on links for group chats no matter what I do. I updated it again, turned off my phone, switched browser and nothinggg its annoying"
Issues with the last update. I cannot send recent photos or screenshots through the app. This needs fixing!
I can't receive my phone calls or send photos on whats app Why. I went to all the proper settings and it still won't let. How can this be resolved?
Its a very good app and i will rate it 5star if it adds more security options for a particular chat that is the option to hide a chat or lock it.thank u keep it up 👍good job.
"Worst app.. Earlier it was okay but now the app is worthless in this app the security of the user is compromised, another problem is that whenever I change dp it removes automatically itself.. Worst app at all."
"Why keep exclusive feature to iOS and less feature on Android, and why not. Introduce unsend and re-edit message, and why not add preview chat without sending read receipts for Android, this is my hate for this app 😭"
I can't access my gallery through whatsapp to put a status i dont know what is that .... I can only able to access the WhatsApp images and photos... This happens after Android 13 update on samsung...
I missing that sound when we delete our current recording voice message (the sound when it enters to the bin). So pls give an update and correct that
"After update i am facing a problem for Chat backups, It's not exporting my 3 years chat in recent years to save my memories... pl find any changes for that."
Next update should have a password or fingureprint option to access So there is more privacy Also if we can have the archive option hidden somewhere or else whats the meaning if some one gets to know that I have some archives pls Or you can keep it an option that if we want the archive option to be seen or hidden ~ Your genuine user
Its a nice app but why i am gonna give it 2 stars is because if you get banned you will lose access to everything you have on your WhatsApp... There should be at least 3 warning to that particular person b4 serious action can should be taken. Thanks : )
"This new media picker is useless, how can something like this even get approved for beta testing. Really useless and backwards, makes me want to stop using the app."
It was running well but now there are some new bugs. Like it shows the last seens in year 2000 :/ there are some other date bugs too.. please fix it.
"sometimes it drops call but overall excellent. please don't tell the public that WhatsApp is FREE because that is a lie, if we don't buy data or pay interest bills that are so high we can not make a WhatsApp call. 😂😂🙌🙏"
I can't install the updated WhatsApp in my phone Is always showing uninstall from the play store and install again. And I have doing that for some days now but its not working
Since a while I can't select and send more than 1 pic at a time. Normally when I opened gallery on whatsapp it would open mij phone gallery which I always use. Now it automatically selects whatsapp gallery...
"Make a feature of status showing to nobody. And also do make features for read receipts on -off to everyone,my contacts, except and nobody."
"There should be a feature like that when we press an emoji the emoji should be as big as long we press , just like FB massanger. and We need some emojis for love , like hug emojis for couple for friends that looks realistic. Thank you"
"Same problem as other users, since update, doesnt allow to send pictures from the camera. FIX IT!"
"I hava some suggestions; 1) Fix community groups, interface is too confusing. 2) Give users options for how long a status last. 3) Add a find user feature/anonymous chat similar to telegram."
"The new feature is irritating everyone..that undo option is not useful and irritating too.When we delete messages, particular chat was not going back to its previous date..it is staying in today's chats..we think that was little stupid feature..kindly please remove that undo option feature.Or atleast let that chat go back for it's previous date after deleting messages..let the chat not stay in today's chat after deleting messages and go down for its previous date..only 1 star for this feature"
"I been using whatsapp for quit long time i never used it against policy i did obey the T&C but then my whatsapp is blocked and when i emailed the support team they stated that my account is blocked due to several complaints on my account, whatsapp should really raise a clear investigation on what has happened on the account due to personal reasons few report the number but it's not actually our fault. I use whatsapp for work purposes all my work information is shared in the whatsapp group."
I've updated this app and still I can't see certain messages because it says I still needs to update meanwhile I've done it.. this app is beginning to become a mess.
Seeing the status in the dp section is gd. It's a nice update but after that we r unable to see the dp in the bigger and widely mode. So I hope this problem needs to be fix down.
"A very useless update has come, the video call screen does not shrink, it just shuts down, please fix this bug."
While sharing photos only whatsapp images are visible.. not showing any other folder.. this happened after the recent update..
The feature that limits only 3 chats to pin is very bad there should be no limitations to it so that we can pin groups and chats in WhatsApp. Please fix this with an update.
Facing problem while opening chats and status. Automatically getting back in fraction of seconds.
Latest update issue. WhatsApp doesn't recognize galery's phone. I can't make phone call because it always connecting. Useless
Good communication app but some glitches and things don't make the app fun that's why I give one star I personally want one change about this app they want to increase the status time by atleast one minute hope me The idea will not go to waste thanks whatsapp team ✨
"Since yesterday 25th Dec, 2022 I can't view anyone's status and Can't see any videos. Furthermore no pic can be seen in the chat, I have to tap on the pic to view it. First time since it's use I'm facing any problem. Pls solve it soon."
Can no long attach a video from my gallery. Only allows pictures/videos already on WhatsApp. Seen other reviews regarding this matter. Needs fixing.
It would be better if the photo or video status is uploaded in high quality. The quality is automatically degraded after uploading.. Please fix this 😕😕
This app help me and my friend to chat while they are outside the country I also advise you to use this app because it is more helpfull and high perfomable app in communication with data sever bundle
"Whatsapp is the best for conversation with friend's, family or other people. I had been started used whatsapp sicne i had blackberry phone. Love it so much until now. Keep continues whatsapp. Hopefully they'll be lite version for lower android device"
"I suddenly can neither download nor upload any kind of media, including pictures photos videos statuses, even voice messages arent downloadable, whats wrong?"
"Hi whatsapp , I don't know what happened but when I select a chat room person with whom I have chatted get not selected .. means it not even get selected and my chats are not getting selected . Now ?? Please fix it as soon as possible"
The Delete message feature is absolutely Useless as the recipient can still see sender tried to send a message and then deleted it. Defeats the purpose of the Delete feature.
"I am hating a lot the ton of steps I need to take to be able to visualize a profile photo, I don't want to be redirected to their stories, I DO NOT."
Is there any way that your algorithm software can make your profile picture with more resolution and clear.. every I put my own picture it always down it to lowered resolution.. we want quality..
I've loved the experience so far. I just have one request. Can Whatsapp add the poll feature to the Status section? I think it's going to be awesome. I love you guys.

I think integrating profile pic and status together is STUPID. And it's totally IMPOSSIBLE to send pics or videos from the camera from inside the app
Can you please reduce waiting time if SMS is not received upon registration? It's not our fault the network failed to send SMS to our mobile and it happens quite a lot in our country.
"So I can't view 1 photo from my friend. Just this one friend not the others. So I assume it's some kind of bug or lag, how do I fix this?"
"The app is good Regarding the status on WhatsApp, it should develop a section of close friends in WhatsApp where u can add or remove friends from list of close friends according to their convenience."
"I am very dispointed with the whtsapp, whatsapp is showing error due to stop my service, when I am again login and veryfi than after not receive any code. Can you resolve my issues."
Right now we can share just a single jpeg/pdf/video to another app like email/dual whatsapp/snapchat etc. It would be great if we can share multiple items to another apps.
"Whatsapp lately has this bug which shows the chat history incorrectly. For example I messaged someone today and the history it showed was "" December 2039 "" Please fix this."
I didn't know that you can send text messages photos and videos to this app when other apps are full.
"Used to be great, now can't add multiple pictures from my gallery, have to do one at a time, waste of time, don't know why it changed??"
"Horrible: the latest update is too much, frequent call drops, the online statues removed while active. Don't liking it and most people are complaining about it,"
"I had the worst experience ever with all meta platforms, my Facebook account got hacked and they disabled my account permenantly and then Instagram and I had those accounts since 2005 so you can imagine how many photos, memories, connection with people I have lost, then all of the sudden my WhatsApp banned my number and no costumer service to talk to, and every time I send an email I get automated replies, no human rights, no evidence of breaking the terms of use, no investigation. Disappointing"
"Please remove the feature ""who can see when I'm online"". And after updation having whatsapp calling issues.Its not work properly and almost shows netwotk problem even having good networks."
"Dear Team, You have added the feature of poll but since person is even able to vote on all options, hence purpose is somewhere drifting from actual functionality. Kindly replace poll with checkbox functionality and make poll a single select only. I hope you like my suggestion."
"Been using the apps for years, but after the recent updates, my apps seems stuck/freeze and unable to perform any action. Especially when receiving a phone or video calls, also a sudden black screen whenever I received a call. Aside of that, the messages got delayed in order to sent. Notifications won't pop up anymore and I have to open the apps to know incoming chat Works fine before this, FIX THIS"
"It's a good app for business.it helps me a lot.although I am looking forward for some new improment,like we can only forward a massage to 5 people at a time,this takes a lot of time,I want you to increase it from 5 to 100 even though we are willing to pay for it.please I am waiting for reply"
"Hey Team WhatsApp, It will be more useful if you adjust the option of 'POLL' in status, instead of an individual Chat. So the user ask people for their opinion in public instead of typing the one by one."
What the hell r u doing with this app... During vdo call on full screen mode we can move our video picture but in window mode it got stuck on the same position even after changing the position on full screen.. Very disappointed with such things..
It is good for communication as well as sharing our precious moments with the help of photos and videos..
"Suddenly my WhatsApp stop working. I tried to send messages to my frnds but It won't send,so i thought my internet not working but it was fine i was able use youtube and other online apps.please fix this glitch as soon as possible and i uninstalled WhatsApp and reinstalled but then the messages were not restoring"
"This update sucks.....Why do i keep getting banned for nothing....i say Telegram is the way to go,Scheduling message is needed.....and also video messages.....and it also sends messages late.....it lags and crashes time to time.....update sucks and it still sucks,now we cant screenshot view once pics😐"
Suggestion! It will be absolutely great if WhatsApp will add cool features like adding music on a WhatsApp status just like on Instagram.
"Incoming call buttons are not respondible. Interface reaction is inadequate. When you trying to respond the call the interface restriction you to another bigger window of cold choice, so where you are trying to respond and this window May respond after five times... It's not able to edit messages. Deleting button hidden. the program is incomplete for user Only possible to use for voice calls. Annoying start and sounds in the voice messages"
"I like the new reactions. However, whatsapp used to reconnect automatically if you lost connection for a minute. Now it just dies. Thanks for fixing the ringing issue"
"Can we please have the option to check all groups we are in, and most important the toggle to disable auto download of medio on groups, too much trash gets accumulated."
"Can you just stop pop up messages saying that calls and messages are end to end encrypted? Excusatio non petita, accusatio manifesta. So I got curious and I went to read your privacy policy. You really have a strange concept of privacy and of ""end to end encryption"". I suggest others to do the same since I don't have enough character to report how screw up their privacy policy is."
It's pretty great but I feel like the WhatsApp company should looking into making the disappearing message to be a one side thing and not have the other party knowing that the other party is using it. Because I'd like to set it on my end. I didn't realize that other people can see and change it also.
Hey. I'm currently facing an issue while sharing the photographs and videos in the WhatsApp. I'm unable to send the group of photos after the multiple selection of photographs limited to 30 per time. It usually open the first photo in the row of the pictures and is not share the selected one. Kindly have a check on it. THANK YOU.
I never was prompted to put password or 64 digit number when end to end encrypted backup was on. But now when I switched to new phone it's asking for password which I never used in the first place and now I'm unable to restore all my data
"Great app. Would be great if we had an option to block forwarded messages only, to avoid annoying chains from people we can't really block."
"I'm having an problem with the app. I am getting temporary banned everyday for 6 hours, but I don't understand why that's happening as I'm using the original version of the app and I'm not doing anything wrong while using the app. Please help me. This is getting really annoying!!!"
"Much better than standard messenger. Our extended family has both Iphones and Androids. We use WhatsApp exclusively for video chats, group messaging. Easiest to use with overseas military members. Photo sending is better quality than traditional messengers. Security, backup, all seamless."
"Hi Team, can we modify whats app to add function to edit sent messages. It will be really helpful to correct spelling mistakes or other things ."
"Since the recent Android update, I'm unable to select from my Gallery folders like I used to before, only allowing me to attach photos from WhatsApp conversations, which is ridiculous. This needs changing back immediately"
"Can no longer send gallery photos in the chat without having to search for my Samsung gallery, the default photo share is only photos from Whatsapp gallery. Frustrating and clumsy."
unfortunately it is easy to start a group call in error. It is not easy to see when group call has been closed down. Not colour blind friendly. Each message has ticks that change colour when receiver has read the message....I can see some colours but these are so close I and many like me struggle to see the difference. Been using the app for years and had never even noticed this till I was told in last few weeks.
Now it has all the features i want and it is easy to use the UI is very smooth. Also give a new update for Whatsapp 🙂.
"Please make improvements, when we forward a picture with text below, it only sent the picture only without the text. So, we have to use the share function but it have to do it one by one. It make it hard to do with a lot of pictures with text."
"Recent update: an update. POP UP NOTIFICATIONS NOT AVAILABLE - I haven't been able to receive notifications on my phone unless I open the app, I am no longer able to turn this feature on at all. Help! Also, when I try to connect to bluetooth devices, my phone is connect to the bluetooth but whatsapp doesn't recognize this and remains on the normal/loud speaker."
"Please change colour theme of this app this green colour theme.. in the chat section. Please make it plain as its on iphone on i phone its looking better .. and beautiful to see.. an comfortable , so please update the overview of the app"
"From the past three days, I'm getting temporarily ban from whatsapp for 1 hour. There is no suspicious activity on my app and I have been using the same WhatsApp messenger for years. I sent an email to support and they said that I have an unofficial app. I uninstalled and installed again but the issue is there"
"Hello admin, I have deleted my WhatsApp couple of mins back mistakenly after reinstalling i didnot found my data back. Could you please check n retrieve my data back as I have few study links which are very important to me.."
"My rating was 5☆, but hey, you restive rascals just have to update often, isn't it? 😃 With new, cool ""features"" like not seeing every videos in fullscreen anymore, but with a thick black bar on the bottom! If you care about captions, just add a black transparent bar, don't ruin the video ratio, it's now reduced with about 15%... with a lot of black on the sides and bottom."
"Kinda annoying how photos arent saved on the app. I've lost alot of Photos and videos, thinking it will work the same as messenger... it does not work even with backup turned on"
"The app is amazing and everything but I despise the new update the archived chats used to stay ARCHIVRD even if someone sent you a text. Now whoever sends you a text comes out of the archives. You literally ruined the whole feature of ""archived chats"""
"This app is terrible. It never works at all. Won't load with a profile picture, Won't load without one. Can't even set up an account without it shutting down."
"Ever since the upgrade where you can keep the desktop and mobile unlinked the application has been giving storage issues and losing all the messages, requiring me to manually attempt to restore tweaking with the internal files. But always lose the messages of the last day, since is based on last backup, but sometimes I lose an entire week of messages. No support was able to help solve this issue. This is the only reason why I'm giving 1 star."
Best app I feel . It connects us to our family and friends and don't applies any subscription fee that's a wonderful thing.
"Same issue that everyone is having can't select multiple photos, getting to the gallery is a nightmare now... please fix this ASAP, it's pushing me more towards FB messenger."
"Nice app. Could you make finding groups more flexible? Like Facebook, Instagram and Telegram. Also, allow us to add multiple profile pictures or short vids just like Telegram. The app is considered boring by most (as in those I know) And make it more lively...cuz without contacts you're basically alone🥲 unlike Facebook, Instagram and Telegram, where you could just search for a subject and find many people of similar interest."
"The updates that you are giving now is much useful for us. And then one request form my side, will you make an update for separating a column especially for WhatsApp groups as like as for chats and status. Sometimes it'll become harder to find the groups between the chats. We can use search option for searching the group, but some people make name of groups with unidentified fonts for your app. That's from my side, if possible give an update for the request."
Failure in uploading status in whatsapp....it's fails repeatedly.. thought it was network issue...but other apps like YouTube and many downloads was possible..but uploading a 30seconds status wasn't possible..... Need to fix it soon... literally hated
"Great app till yesterday, suddenly all my conversations are not in chronological order after deleting messages?!. Is it because of a setting of the application or there is another problem with this? How to fix this?"
"Great app for texting. However the biggest issue is backing up the messages. Can't neither backup nor restore messages while roaming and having no wifi around. Wish I could log in on to my new phone and have all my messages on the ready like Facebook Messenger, without having to worry if I have backed up my messages from my old phone. Also, logging in seems to be a struggle as you might get send verification code to your number and never get it, as you might not have phone signal."
A very good application for anyone I appreciate meta but there is a problem that some times when a open my friends account that time that not shows that what time he was online that is the only problem . Other side this is the best application. Thanks and that is the only reason that I give this application 4/5. Thank
"Updates are coming late, video call picture quality can be better, cannot hear other person's voice in voice calls even if the internet is working fine.... Other than that everything is fine"
"My WhatsApp page do not appear on my phone screen, I have to go to Google play store to open my account. I need a help, I don't know how to restore it on my phone screen."
Your team needs to develop a feature that enables up to edit text that one has sent. I want to be able to edit text I've sent instead of sending another one to make corrections
"WhatsApp is by far the best messaging app. It offers privacy, you can see when someone is online, when they read your message, send photos and videos. And you can even create your own avatar. What more could you ask for ? 😊"
This new version is awful. There should be a toggle switch to disable the active caller highlighting in multi chat videos. Ive just had a video call with 3 other participants and had to put a piece of paper over the screen to hide the participants. When each person was talking or even just moving around the boxes would flash a white light. This was very distracting. Please add a disable function.
Backup to google drive gets stuck at 99% after the last update (24/10/2022) No backup to google drive has completed after that. I have tried all common fixes and my google drive has 165 gb free space.
"Please introduce the edit option for the message sent ...as many times because of one or two word typing error, we have to delete the entire message and then retype it again..."
"After update, very worst app , more bugs are found , can't make video call,i can't receive new messages instantly"
My work makes me using WA hours a day to contact many people and join many group chats. Can you please develope feature that makes personal chat and group chat present in a different tab? So theyre not pop up in one place. I think it would really help. You also can make it available to on/off this feature in case some people dont need it. Please considere it. WA is amazing and helpfull communication apps!
This double check mark when message is read is manytimes hard to see whether is blue or gray. Could be bigger or another color. Or make possible another color in settings...
WhatsApp provides the best messaging experience ever but it got only one problem that I wish would be solved one day...... The problem is not having another way for restoring your account back other than the phone number.... I wish they would add like an option for email connection or something similar
"Reddiculous gallery issue since last update. Have to click through several buttons /menus to get my phones gallery of photos (instead of the WhatsApp gallery), and even then I can share videos from my phones gallery as it only shows the photos!"
"Name of the account when u send message to yourself(preauth(you)) does not make sense, I think it's a test name , which you did not bother to update"
"After updating my Samsung S22 Ultra, settings in whatsapp has changed. the default media folder and video options gone and I can't send videos unless I open my phone gallery and share it to my whatsapp contact."
"I really like your application as it can allow keyboards to access to whatsapp and it also allows to video call,text and message to anyone at any moment.There are also a lot of gifs and stickers of different expressions depending upon the mood of an individual :D"
"This app should develop some updates according to me, 1. If our call is going on, and if someone calls us then , he/ she should know with whom I am talking 2. If we want to select any two sentences from a big paragraph then,....what should we do...... 3. If we are calling some person and if he/she is not answering the call, then we should know about the exact location of that call....."
"I having some problems in this app,like i can't hear the voice messages properly Because whenever I am playing any voice message my phone screen is turning off and the voice message is getting muffled and I can't hear it properly. So please fix it!"
"Finally tracked down the problem to whatsapp. In the update (3 days ago aow), whatsapp broke some audio settings with mobile browsers and now doesn't allow video's to play while in a call. Worked perfectly before now no browser vid works, tried with multiple websites"
"What's going on? I have been using this app for more than 10 years. I got up this morning and saw this message saying that my account is temporarily banned? NONSENSE! My family and colleagues are not able to reach me via WhatsApp now. The app is getting worst. My friend just recommended Telegram, I will give it a try. Whatsapp is a terrible app."
"Best chatting app... But if few features added, then no similar app can compete: 1. Screen sharing while on WhatsApp call 2. Screen annotation while screen sharing 3. Hashtags for quick filter options 4. Assigning tasks to others coworkers Etc. Etc."
The App is overall perfect!!! But I'm disappointed about the stickers stuff...it's not able to load tha new stickers...I always make sure to update ..but i don't know what's happening ... Please do something!!
"Bring an option like we can hide and keep our profile picture... Thankyou for considering my opinion. But now even if i hide my profile picture,it can be seen the one who was hidden from viewing Please solve the bug.thankyou for solving the bug..it will be gud if a option was there is an option to see how many minutes/times a person views our status"
If we get normal call while talking on WhatsApp video call automatically voice will be coming out from the wireless Bluetooth . This is the major issue we are facing. Slove this problem as soon as possible
One of the worest Application i don't see like thsi service calls failure since morning am trying to load what's app Web facing the uncaught error with dev tools failed un expects token doc type is not valid JSON. NOT at all doing basic qa Testing and releasing the product direct to the market. Shame on what's app face... Off
"Unclear, confusing service migrating between devices, especially when using web version, as there are many WhatsApp icons, difficult to know which one to use. So disappointing."
It is very usefull for us....it is necessary for us because it is very easy to communicate each other by chatting calling video calling ..and fro group also.....I love this app💗
"This is an amazing app Btw, you should add this version that if we are taking the screen shot the other person should know that and appear on chat. Any how the new version was cool"
"App feels and looks good...But the updates are not working well in my mobile... All of my friends having updated specifications like status on contact search, Group video calls, Etc.,But I'm not getting anything like that...Why is that? That's why I reduced one star...I hope u get this..."
"They changed the video/photo sharing system for absolutely no reason, now I can't share videos at all, and it's so unnecessarily complicated just to send a screenshot. Awful."
"I face trouble in rotate picture, i have to rotate 3 times then i find correct side pics. Kindly add rotate left and rotate right option as it was before."
Please remove the status update where we can see status on tapping the profile photo even though we don't want to see the status. In my opinion there should be two option when clicking on profile picture 1) view profile picture 2) view status then it could be very useful update for the users.
It's a worst app.. It's almost a month when It blocked me suddenly from using the whatsApp and saying that i have gone against the policy of whatsApp.. But i haven't done anything like this and now this is stoping me from using the whatsApp. Why this is happening.. Please resolve this issue as soon as possible...
"Didn't had any complaint till date, but last seen of most of the people are coming wrong for example: if my frnd was online till 8:15 and went offline but again came online at 8:30 and back offline at 8:32 it still showing 8:15 even when I am viewing it at at 8:45. It is skipping many last seens in between."
I tried to get back on messenger and this was the only thing that I can figure out WhatsApp Messenger I had message you before but I deleted it because it kept coming up SMS and I didn't want that because I tried to send podcasts and other comedy to my friends and I couldn't send it to him they were not getting it it was all coded with all types of letters and semicolons and slashes and other numbers and things and it was very confusing I don't know how to get back on what I originally had it is
"It's a great app, just a small suggestion that it would be grateful if you make different tabs for individual and group chats as sometimes it's difficult to find the groups."
What a terrible experience 🤦.. New whatsapp version doesn't have service unbinding component in video statues until a new video is played 😕. Just imagine dat d audio of the last viewed video status is still playing even when chatting with another person. Only Android programmers will understand this better
Needs to be able to adapt to colors based on the wallpaper and phone accent on Android 12/13 devices. The Green color looks outdated. Also how long for a separate tab for groups? Groups are just lost in regular conversations.
"Have some issue, it seems that I cannot send a video even it's 00:30-01:00 long, when I try to send a videos to my friend it stuck there for a long time and doesn't upload. Please fix this issue"
"It was a good messaging app, not until you have to transfer to a new phone. Hope the team will figure out how to transfer as smooth as facebook messenger/telegram does."
"It keeps lagging these days, it's is annoying. The messages sometimes takes hours to get delivered. It's not the wifi problem."
The new update of WhatsApp.. the status view touch on profile photo space . look like an Instagram js Very disappointed.. it's very hard to use to seeing profile picture.. that update is very bad innovation... Because whatsapp are we are used to chat with others.. ath the time we try to open profile it's make very difficulty to use.. it's very disappointed.. please make old type .. there is don't need that updation...
Last update I am use video call that time minimize video call but not satisfied. My face down the display. I can't use my face uper my display. I can't see my friend face. This is Very wrong. I can't use my face uper on display.
I bought a new s22 plus But I cant send videos. As it keeps saying failed to process the video. I realised. WhatsApp doesn't support HDR10+ videos from s22 plus. So disappointed 😞
New update isn't good with photos. It's a whole mission to attach a photo and you can't even send videos without sending it from your actual gallery. Why?! Please fix it!!!
"Whatsapp does not let you select recent photos taken from media anymore. Shows older ones. Have to go to gallery, select the recent picture and share it again which is a bit inconvenient."
Application is very good. But old files are not downloaded after some days .While these files and photos are required these are not not downloaded. Please work on it.It will be helpful for all users.
"Hi This thing of trying to view a profile and then one must choose between viewing status or profile, the old way was better and more convenient,, why view statuses like that while you have a statuses on another tab,,,"
This latest update has ruined the app. I can see lots of other users having issues with the gallery. I can no longer send screenshots to whatsapp chats via the whatsapp app. I need to go to gallery and then share to send it. Fix it please whatsapp.
"The app works fine. Design and features could be improved, so it's similar to the iOS version (status preview, chat preview, smoothness, etc.)"
"video call quality really bad. hope they would improve. red still looks pale on video calls. picture is of low quality too :( other than that, everything fine"
Dear wastup team your recent update was very helpful self contact chating update it's was helping our user's when any text or countent remeber it's and wny watsup contact chating with the numbar without saving it's very helpful and I want another feature from wastup what is that now iam telling you duplicate files privent downloading and various groups . Please update this fetur it's helps you more successful you
"Is it my imagination or are adverts on Facebook related to my conversations here? Is it secure? The new grammar function is irritating, the screen jumps and it selected words instead of letters so you end up deleting by mistake. Messy interface"
"after latest update, during video call if the camera is turned off once, you can't turn it on again. Have to cut the call and do it again. So frustrating."
"I've been having a problem since last day with the date. The date is not correct. When I wanna send a msg, it shows 2028! When someone sends sth, it shows 2016!"
"Since the update can't send videos as videos, have to send them as a document and can't send photos from the gallery without multiple steps. Absolute joke"
"Hello. Could you please keep the archived conversation fold hidden somewhere? I like to archive conversations in a place where they don't feature on top of all the other chats, because I file them so I don't have to look at them. thanks!"
"After the Android Oxygen 13 update, the photos in the device cannot be viewed through the app, and hence we are not able to share it. Often we have to go to photos app, click share through WhatsApp, then select contacts and then we have to share it with others"
It's a bad feeling how do I mean you don't want us to update the WhatsApp app anymore since it's only brings glitch and all .when you delete chats it will not return back to the relevant date after deleting and this is so frustrating.. the media is not okay as well ... All the reviews above is what you ppl should consider in before releasing updates..it makes ppl sick and tired... Plz do the needful
Still has bugs that can be exploited.For example if i change my number on one device whatsapp does not automatically logs me out of the previous device and thus leaving the possibility of having two devices logged in to the same number without my consent thus compromising confidentiality
"Fingerprint lock sucks! There used to be no issues but in the last few days I keep getting ""locked out"" and forced to wait for the fingerprint sensor behave."
"Unable to share PNG, MP4, JPG, etc. Error popping out that file format not supported. Many bugs still remains. Currently on Android 13 this what development team need to focus on."
"Everything is nice but after the latest updates now i am unabole to minimize video call, whenever i try to minimize the video call and try to chat.. video gets paused.. my phone settings is ok.. there is nothing wrong in my phone settings"
"Hello, When you are calling someone on WhatsApp, can you make it possible to not have the phone ring while it's on ""calling"". It should just ring only on ""Ringing"". Surely, I am not the only one it bothers."
"When play a voice clip, the screen closes and the voice clip also stop, sometimes the mobile also hangs. I have face this problem many times in different mobile phones.."
I loved it when I switched to WhatsApp business only because of how simple you can view statuses with just a click on the person's profile. Please implement that feature in this also. Thank you
Good Evening Whatsapp This update is good with poll option And also my suggestion for next update is voice note clarification like if a person sends a voice note about 30 seconds and receiving person heard the voice note about 20 seconds only means whatsapp should acknowledge to the sending person that the receiver heard the note about 20sec only. This will very useful update. Thank you and Have a great day
I am very disappointed for the latest version because in whatsapp our number is shown by (you) this is very good but that (you) is showing for other contact also sometimes. where I miss forwarded a message. So please create a solution for this intolerance activity immediately.
After the recent update I am not being able to view photos received from WhatsApp contacts in my gallery. For viewing media files received through WhatsApp I have to go to storage files and find them.
"this app is good to stay in touch with your family and your friends, but it's dangerous. don't send pics of yourself to someone you dont know! it could get somewhere in the net, please be careful! but thank you so much for whatsapp, it's amazing! <3"
Very good to keep in contact with friends and you can make groups with loads of people in. The one thing I will say is that it's turning a bit too much like Snapchat with avatars now but I like them and other people I know do so don't remove them👍
"I'm impressed with the new features of avatar, poll, etc. It's simple reliable and trustworthy as it is."
"This app is very toxic. If fills up your phone with Malware, then if you clear the junk data off your phone the app won't even allow you to register your number back to the app! What's App is a waist of time and it causes trouble because you will lose contact with the fools who believe in this app."
"It's great until the light theme comes up, cause I felt bored using the dark theme. I think there should be an adjusment to control the light theme, cause in me it's like the sun that's too bright or it's just me? Thank you"
"I cannot send pictures, I've just taken unless they were taken on WhatsApp. I have to go to my gallery and select share from there. I cannot back up. It's glitching snd can't complete it Get this sorted meca"
After the latest update i have problem in using the app.it keeps closing while using .i don't know how to fix this problem .i tried uninstalling and reinstalling but there is no change . please look into this problem.
"great app overall. but i highly recommend a ghost mode, in which a user can be online and view groupchat messeges or contacts’ messeges, view status updates, etc without it being visible to other users."

This app is brilliant but no status save options. Its not a harmful app its secure. I can personally chat for people and no one show my chats. Its not to be compare with others app just like Facebook and other.
I am out of whatsapp for the last one week. Tried several times to get it back. But proper response. Please look into it restore the same. Thank you.
"Good... Poll icon is the best movement.. Pls give more options in Poll icon. like fixing time duration to choose answer, and. don't allow to choose more than one option. and lock the chosen option"
"Why is it that my profile photo always disappears and every time I open the VPN several times it always has an error, please fix it. That pisses me off!."
"after the new update...we can't screen shot when someone send with view once...and its kinda dissapointed...hope whatsapp bring back the old one, when we can still screen shot even view once :)"
"Great app for chatting, making calls, and all the other stuff! It's good 'cos you don't need phone credit, you can chat from WiFi!"
"The new whatsapp update is horrible 😫, I can't listen to audio 😢 and even do status I can't make call, this is horrible 😢 ,what hurts more is when I don't have airtime"
Whatsapp is very convinient to use compared to other apps i really like it. Fast msgs less data consumption however its better if whatsapp can add edit msgs. Its very inconvinient to send messages over n over again due to spelling errors and also when msgs r deleted inthe chat the oposite party can see we deleted something i think thats inconvinient to most people. People usually ask what we have deleted. But overall whatsapp is perfect getting these problems solved will make it much better.
There's a lack of network when voicecalling I don't know but everytime its irretating me with voicecalling so much of poor network when in real the network is working very fine in but whatsapp lack with voicecalling system please do improve this issue .rather then 5star im giving for excellent function..
"I was an apple user, i have shifted in to an android. Now i faced 1 issue i thought to share it here, As there is a feature in Apple that you can delet for everyone in the broadcast list, but in android there is no option to delet for everyone in broadcast list, as many of us who are in marketing facing this issue so i thought to share it with you too. May always better should be invented."
I cannot access this freaking app because they want me to wait 10 hours for a verification code. I think this is because everytime I tried opening it (which was not an issue until today!!!!🤬) they wanted to verify my number which i did 4 years ago and NO my number is still the damn same. The app is raggedy as hell do not use it at all people!!! Stay away!!!!
"After I updated it, Whatsapp has stopped giving me notification for messages and I don't know why, I've checked all setting and they re ok but it still does not alert me when a new message comes in, please do something about the notification issue"
Suggestion: You can also provide a new feature for using WhatsApp web that is password protection for using the same. As such no one can misuse or use my WhatsApp web in my laptop without my permission or without knowing the password (entry password). It can keep chats and other details confidential and protection to my contacts for believing that it's me on that chats.
After the latest update when I an changing any contact name it is not being changed on whatsapp. Chat still shows with the old name for a long time.
"I receive my messages only when I open the app ... if I do not open it for several hours, no new message arrives... do anybody know why? Thanks"
In my WhatsApp application video call and voice call are not done well .....if I call someone...then ringing and after shown connecting.....but call are not connected.
"Noticed so many bugs. 1. Group call bug - When you're on a group call sometimes only a few can hear you while some can't, but you can hear them. Total mute. Not less audible. 2. Media sharing - When you send multiple media files through whatsapp only a few gets received by the receiver although it shows as everything's been sent by your end. 3. In accurate notification count - Received message count is inaccurate when hidden content feature is switched on."
"Okay, I'll be brief. Why can't u read files on ur internal storage, on the app if by some mishap they get lost. I've got all my voice notes and all videos from last month saved on my phone and they are fine, but when I go to whatsapp to tap them, they say, ""sorry, this media file does not exist on your internal storage, when it does"". An admin shouldnt get to delete what others post, and why will only Admins be notified of a gc exit. Dumb. Fixing what ain't broken. I'd give it 0 stars if I could"
"I am using the official app from PlayStore for WhatsApp and I have gotten temporarily banned from the app twice in the past 24 hours. I have contacted WhatsApp to assist and they are extremely unhelpful and send an automated email, not acknowledging the actual contents of my query. I use WhatsApp for work often and this is quite frustrating especially as I am using the app responsibly."
"Worst experience feel on 26/09/2022 when I have replaced my phone and take proper backup in Google Drive, while I was restoring my data then showing eroor pls wait after long wait my data couldn't be restored. Many important chats , transaction images, videos all data got erased. If any user have any trick or solution so pls let me know and help me."
"Since last update there is issue while watching the status video, post exit from that the video is running in the background... Pls fix this..."
"After the new version update, i can't share videos directly from the WhatsApp. For sharing videos i go to first my gallery then share videos into the WhatsApp. Otherwise I can't share videos directly from WhatsApp."
"It's a very fine and convenient and a simpler app to connect with other via text as well as via calling. One Sugg that I wanna to give whatsapp that don't they think that people in this world are connecting to whole world instead of self, so there should be a self-chat corner where people can talk to themselves and enjoy there own company. Hoping you'll check it out. Please do consider it in next update. Thanks for such a Amazon app."
"I am getting no notification from whatsapp, no tone, no pop up message on the screen. I've sent your customer support a message a week ago and I'm still waiting for a response. Such a big company, but doesn't seem like they care about the customer service."
"I don't know wht happened but recently,all my messages every data on WhatsApp has stopped showing. It isn't deleted, cuz I still find them in my gallery and documents. But very disappointing."
"App won't let me send any gifs I record at all. Everything else works perfectly and videos are sent immediately. When I try to send a GIF it says ""Can't send this GIF. Please choose another one and try again."" It's been days. I tried reporting the problem several times and it keeps telling me it's my connection. It's obviously not. Please fix this."
"This has allowed my phone to make international calls and send and receive texts from Uganda, where I send some money support to several honorary sons. It is very rare that the app does not work or cannot fulfill its functions. It is one of the Ugandans who recommended this app to me."
The app is a good app I just want to be able to crop videos like how I crop pics before sending them to my status that's all. Have a good day
I am getting the same problems like everyone else since the new Android update my recent pictures won't show up when trying to attach a picture.
This app is amazing.. but you should add an option to like a status.. so that we don't have to reply that person.. simply we can like that status and leave.
"Messages aren't sending since hours,my browser,other social applications work only WhatsApp doesn't! I have my closest contacts in WhatsApp and i can't reach them. I tried restarting my phone checked my connection...and I'm experiancing the same.problem"
"Nice try but this new update has two problem First: when i opened status of video and close it, sound of that video will still be playing Second: when i am using other app and my data is still on notifications of messages from my whatsapp view once and disappear not like before"
"App was used to be good. Not trustworthy for private message. Glitch is that sometimes status song play in background, even you minimize the app."
Just a suggestion: If possible group list for sharing the status under status privacy can be added as a feature. Like select list or group... It will be easier to share as not every time we need to select the contacts based on our privacy content
Great app......but I however don't like archived messages being at the top.....can the app be in a way the archived messages be at bottom as it was previously......or it's done in a way that it's optional(top or bottom) according to the likes of each user......
"Keeps saying no internet, when i have both wifi and mobile data. Other apps and internet works just fine, reading reviews sounds like others are having the same issue. Needs fixing asap. Due to above issue tried reinstalling, now it wont register the number, pop up message saying 'theres a problem with whatsapp, try again in 5 minutes' been hours now."
I like the recent update of self texting and I would like to request or give a suggestion for next update of WhatsApp. Please see if you can add a feature of individual chat lock where a person can select what chats he want to lock and what can be put in the open like a hiding app or app lock but only confined to select few chats. We all have people we share our password with in case of emergencies and locking the chat gives certain chats confidentiality and privacy. I hope this helps you and us
"The new update is really bad, it makes it soo hard to find pictures and videos to upload."
"Giving 2 stars because it lags. If I send a message to a girl, the reply shows up on my phone 5 hours later or sometimes never at all."
New update sucks. While in a video call if i minimise it my camera automatically stuck in a fixed position. Another prblm is that in the new update you can't click on insta story links.
"Bad app for calling, ( well not really lol ) when u try to play a game while on call with someone it just flashed black and then normal, and then it loops till you go back on the app"
WhatsApp video call audio call is not working for a long time. Everyone is telling like this. Connecting Connecting Connecting But nobody talks.
"Hi Team Whatsapp, Please introduce a useful feature of sharing one's screen with other whenever on videocall. We would actually appreciate this utility mode. Also, the payment feature introduced was not very helpful to us. Thanks"
"Calling bug is irritating too much. When i use to pick tha call by tapung answer it get disconnected the caller thinks i disconnected... One more thing is call on hold function Before while being WhatsApp call When we get normal call the WhatsApp call get on hold and when we disconnect the normal call is get released from hold automatically, But now we have to open the app and manually tap on resume button to resume the call..."
"Being on Whatsapp is really good when it comes to connecting me with friends and family. However I need to be able to delete my own Whatsapp from my own phone without having to delete my own backup, that would really be helpful, can you make it possible for us please and can you also make it possible for us to backup our own chats on other email or backup service providers besides Google, please?"
Not able to send photos from what's app gallary(Directly from WhatsApp)? We need to got to phone gallary and then share from there which is not convenient. (ony for camera photos and screenshots)
"Thanks for rolling out poll option. Btw please provide multi selection option as well in polls. Also try to rollout checklist kind of tool as well. Suppose if we order some groceries list to shop keeper, he can simply check ✔️ whatever stock available in that list. Or wife asked asked something from market we can check ✔️ whatever items already bought like that. Should be very useful for everyone if you can rollout such kind of day to day usable tools. 👍"
"Great app. Would've given it five stars I could use Whatsapp on more than one Android device, or could use the Whatsapp web version on my tablet. My new Samsung tablet has a large screen, but I still can't use the web version in any browser, even with the desktop site selected. Very annoying.. :("
Developer should work some more in location updation. WhatsApp doesn't update location if we already connected to hi speed internet. Fix the bugs.
I wish my comment will be read. I think whatsapp should've a setting were I can stop receiving message from any group without existing the group itself. We've lots of unnecessary messages from many groups here.
You're welcome and happy to be assisted with routs and roads. Direction to unknown places well featured. Thank you for your easy device and operating ways.
I have been using what's app for years and I really like it...however with recent updates I've list some of the features i once had like setting custom ring tones and notification for my different whatsapp contacts and I'm not happy about that at all.
This version is too good .. and it is very best than other communicating apps . But i have missed one star because this app doesn't allows the hight MB videos to send .... So plase make it correct . And i have an apinion that you peoples of whatsapp will correct this problem...😊
Until 2.11.2022 WhatsApp was great for sending videos/ photos but I can no longer send these. Have tried everything advised even rang my network provider! What has happened to WhatsApp? There isn't the option to update WhatsApp on Google play store as app isn't there any more. Can anyone help please? What does Beta full mean?
"I didn't do anything, and when I checked my WhatsApp all the chats and photos were gone, please provide the best solution as soon as possible, thank you"
Messages are not delivering. This app is used for work and has been very unreliable lately. It has been almost 2 hours and messages have still yet to be delivered this had been happening for a few days
"Hmmm, my experience with Whatsapp is; they are a median for me to reach my friends family or love ones, i can't video call them, voice note them or even wright to them. I can post things on my status and view other people's posts. I have the power to restrict some people from veiwing my post, and if the people I'm veiwing their status are posting rubbish i have the power to mute them. I can send pictures and videos but those videos have to be within a Time limit"
It no longer allows for you to send multiple pictures and accessing the right gallery requires multiple steps. This update is not great!!!!
Dear WhatsApp ..You are good at everything...but...I think you must introduce the one more privacy option that who can call me on WhatsApp...and unknown person is also able to call me and I don't have any option for it... please introduce any settings for it!
"Not showing any notifications i need to check the app to see if i got any messages when i try to fix it this damn app shows ""pop up notifications are no longer available in this android version"" while my phone is up to date and this damn app too fix this problem plzz😒"
"I he options appeared without Audio. I tried the Photo/Video button and changed file type to All. I sent, but at the other end the ""Unable to complete download"" message WhatsApp on both my laptop and mobile. I had an issue with the Web version on my laptop. I had to send voice files that I made, to a group. When I clicked Attach , only five appeared. Eventually, I sent the voice files by mail to my phone and then sent them successfully by WhatsApp. Why no Audio button on Web?If poss please fix."
Having a hard time making a call to someone and it's saying that they're not on Wi-Fi when yesterday I called them and it worked perfectly on the app it's like it doesn't want to work and only works when it wants to and it's very inconvenient and annoying.
"It is a very good app, but I had a idea for the new feature that includes names for everyone those who have registered to whatsapp should automatically get the name which he/she has uploaded in their profile of whatsapp it should be having t&c which says the profile include certain name which they have with their email I id or other documents which includes their original name."
"Good app. Basically used by every South African, but it needs more work on the security side. There have been many instances of people connecting to other people's Whatsapp via Whatsapp Web and scamming the lir contacts out of money. There should be a feature on the app that indicates when an instance of Whatsapp Web linked to that account is being used."
There is a new bug in whatsapp....some times camera turned off automatically when i m in video call...i have tried in more then 4 smartphones of mine but it still turned off somtimes while in a video call please make this issue resolved as soon as possible
"I woke up one day and my chats had disappeared. When I tried to send messages to other people they weren't sending. I tried relaunching the app, still no change. It became worse such that the app isn't opening anymore. My WiFi is perfectly fine. Clearly there's a bug in WhatsApp regarding this issue. Kindly help"
I don't know why I am facing with the problem. My internet is on by 24*7 still I don't receive my message until that app doesn't get open. Please it's a request do look for this glitch and keep me updated. It's making my close one hurt and I am gonna not let that happen. Either I should uninstall this app. And stop your services.
Very bad 1. If I want to change device then all data has been lost.. 😡🤬 2. Unable to connect 2 or 3 devices... 3. Steaker option is bad... 4. Dark mode is very difficult Etc....
I dont want the app to have access toy contacts. It won't work unless you give it access. There's no reason for it to have access unless I want it to.
It will be more convenient if this app can separate between Personal Chat and Group Chat so that I can easily search each of these Chat respectively.
After last update..... And when the end to end encryption backup option is On.... The device connect to internet everyday after certain time it starts to backup every time even when the setting is selected to manual backup. And not only that i tried many times to let the backup process finish but it never finishes...
It is hard to understand this app so I really ain't a big fan yeah I need to make things so difficult for people to understand how to work the situation here but otherwise I guess I'm going to have to learn myself how to work whatever all about but I do have a lot of family members that would love to join whatever and maybe they can teach me how to perform and do all this app instead of give up on it to see can I do it myself or either I can just take it off my phone
The app has stooped down to an unbelievable level. Why are my messages not retained when I type them and just do not enter? And when are you going to enable storing media in sd card rather than on the main memory?
Explain the new feature like that of community properly. It caused problems in my university due to no proper explanation. I thought you have add a feature to group all the groups regarding work for easy access but this was actually connecting them.
"The pool option is amazing, but I send a pool in a group and same users select yes and no both options , is there any way to restrict them for single selection? I means may you give a option to select answer type , either it's yes/no or multiple chouse or single choice etc"
Bluetooth headphones doesn't connect while on a call. Only conects to a Bluetooth headphones before a call is made. Sometimes Bluetooth headphones unpaired while talking on the phone using this app.
I don't get notification when there's a video call or a voice call. I only get notified when i open the app.
"The latest version has a glitch with the opened statuses. It's doesn't show that you have already opened someone status, but all in all everything is okay"
"I have the last version in android, when people send me a view once message this alert appear ""you received a message but your version of Whatsapp doesn't support it"", what are u doing meta"
Please please fix most recent update of when you send a photo and it doesn't go straight to gallery and can no longer send multiple photos. Very very annoying!!
"Recently having serious problem. There is a contact that I already deleted but still exists in Whatsapp. This is not my problem and I had tried every way by whatsapp or google or in yt. Just don't work! when I delete other contacts it worked, just won't work on that single contact."
Bad experience to show on share screen shot. After taking screen shot doesn't share to any group.
Just wants to scrape all my data. Whereas other apps do not require you to hand over all your personal info to use. Will be unistalling ASAP.
"Connectivity issues. Please fix this, even with a stable WiFi connection the app doesn't load messages any more or delivers sent messages. This is stressful please fix. Working fine now."
I don't get notifications any more. The new messages only appear when i open the app. This is going for a while a a fix is more then needed. This is the same with messanger app.
"This app is great, been using it for 3 years now, the calls are glitchy tho wich is annoying and the new update has crowded my phone. Other than that its great! Would recomend for next update, that in group chats, beside your name, can we have people pfp's nexto it. I think it would look cool"
"A logout option would be great, please!!! High time now! (Whatsapp has become a necessity and the world's too annoying!)"
"It's been a good app, but after the recent update the app keeps repeating the previous viewed video while viewing another status .I suggest u give the app better features .Also enable the user to chat viewers from the status and also enable to view status from the DP.Thanks"
"After using this for a year, it unregistered and just gets ""unrecoverable error"". Uninstalled, reinstalled, reset, nothing works. Sent Help request. NADA. Oh well, there's always Messenger."
"One of the problems created in the new version, if the user has added a story and you want to look at her profile picture, you cannot and you will be transferred from the user's profile page to the main page of WhatsApp."
"very Useful app. You should download this app(WhatsApp) you can talk to everyone, in your contacts.or you can send or receive images, videos audio. Or you can put your status and see other status in your contact. Or you can call and video call and message. But you need cellular data to use this app. And other more things here."
After updating now when we are deleting latest message from any chat then also then that particular person goes to its last chat date but nowadays even if we are deleting latest message then also it is not going to its previous date ? Why it is so ?
I can't resotre the whatsapp message after phone reset. There are backup in google drive. 219 MB folder in internal storage. Whatsapp is saying that it has restored 17 messages. But when I open chat there is no message.
"I've recently upgraded my Motorola g60s to Android 12, and since then I'm experiencing freezes and irresponsiveness. Please, review and fix. It's very unstable while having video calls!"
What's up keep cutting me off and every time I need no but I have to be verified and I'm losing all my text messages from my contacts I rate this a one star because of this FIX THE PROBLEM
"Wonderful experience, but a bit changes are very necessary that is! In chats, ""Groups"" and ""DM to any user"" should be displayed in different columns instead one column. Suggestion: Make four column to show data. 1.Chats 2.Groups 3.Status 4.Calls"
"Right now there is a big problem with the whatsapp mobile app it cannot open any kind of pdf format files at all it says that there is been a problem with that file, instead you have to open that file from your pc .please fix this problem."
"It's a great app.... But the new reaction to a message update only shows a push notification, but doesn't flag the conversation it pertains to. This is incredibly frustrating because when I get a message the push notification shows for a second but then I can't clear it. I have to know which conversation to go into, then go open it and click on the reaction to show WhatsApp that I have seen it. Help! Please! WhatsApp, fix the bug!"
"Hey, overall whatsapp is great app for texting and others but i personally don't like this community idea ... Cuz it is creating a separate group which every member can see too... That's the problem i think it should be like i created a community of several groups whatever message i want to send, i send in community and it delivers to all the groups separately in their groups with a mark like ""imp announcement"" etc.. rather then they are being added in separate group under the name of community"
Whatsapp very reliable. Although still having a hard time understanding why it's ad always comes even after downloading it.
"WhatsApp .. It's a very useful app although when I'm trying to call someone it's good but there's always a point where it says ""reconnecting"" which is ok but the call never reconnects so I have to end up ending the call and calling back - but otherwise it's ausome"
ok I've been using WhatsApp for years without any problems and I updated it like 3weeks ago n from I did evertime I try to veiw a video on someone status it keeps on saying I can't view it even when my connection is good it won't let me it just jumps on to another status n when I swipe back it's the same thing over and over I've been patient n it keeps on happening....Please fix this problem cause as far as I know it's not my connection nor my phone it's the app overall.im now updating again
"What happened to the photos from ""All media""??? Used to be able to select photo attachments from the cam icon in the reply box but now the photos only shows photos received from WhatsApp. So now cannot share photos?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!??!"
"I Have noticed the quality of videos uploaded on status is deceased to a low quality compared to original copy. Videos recorded by phone are affected more, please fix this because it doesn't happen on iphone, only android and i use Samsung. Also, high quality images sent on WA android is usually reduced to less 100 KB, that is not right! There should be an option to keep original copy. An option to block a contact from just calling instead to total blocking should be considered please."
When I trying to link my WhatsApp to device laptop or computer. It's not scanned qr code always blurred and not scanned and I am unable to link my WhatsApp to device. My WhatsApp is already latest version but phase same problem long time. Please solve this problem. Thank you!
"I hate this app because: I can't post a video near a long status, please make a limit status Maximum 10 minutes or 6/7/8 min. I hope the maker of this app reads that I have a problem."
"It's a suggestion. There is a search option in every chat, but customising it according to date also might help!"
Can you add a select all messages in any chat from beginning till end or select all messages and forward to someone this feature would be amazing and best if someone lost all chat from other side please add this feature thnx. Overall app is amazing
"Before Last Time Update In chat previous dates are showing Today, Yesterday and after Yesterday count by date is better.... Then right now in chat previous dates are showing Today, Yesterday after Yesterday count Sunday Monday its confusing become we don't remember the always..... Fixed it update previous...."
This is a great app and very usefull but I would like 2 features come in the future. 1) I would like there to be diffrent chats in a group. Like in a school group there is a chat for schoolwork and a chat for just chatting with everybody. 2) I would want there to be away messages in the normal app. Not just the business one.
Hello Team! I recently switched to a new phone and tried getting my WhatsApp in it with all the data backed up but unfortunately it's not working and I'm unable to login into my account with backup data :)
"Not safe to use. Requires permissions as SMS, Call logs and Phone (Why?). Also after update, bluetooth headphones doesn't work. On Dual app ""unable to connect""."
Hey I lost all my data After the recent update Kindly help me to recover it I repeat it happens just after the update All my pictures and videos are lost and the backup is also lost from google drive too.... HELP ME .... REPLY ME Please
"One the best app. Please add a feature to link image and caption while forwarding. When we forward multiple messages at once, caption and images have no relation. Thank you"
"Unable to select screenshots to set status in one go like earlier i used to select 30 pix from screenshot and set as my status now after update unable to do that, wasting my time to set status as need to select one by one"
"Pretty nice to use, though there are still some little glitches during interaction. Sometimes it freezes delaying message delivery. Work on that."
"doesn't let me send any pictures from my phone, it only allows me to send pictures I took on WhatsApp or saved from other people. very annoying that I have to go to the galley and share pictures from there to WhatsApp rather than what it used to be and had access to all my phone photos with attachments at the bottom"
"Not like telegramme app, Getting Features like telegram slowly added into whatsapp. WhatsApp was dead slow even also while copying features from others applications like Kaizala, telegram. Need to be improved 1. Visual Meetings to be introduced like Zoom or Google Meet. 2. Payment also need to be introduced like phonepe or Google pay, Amazon Pay. To recahrge phone bills, Television etc. 3. Edit option is very important when touching the message. 4. Confidential message features needed"
"Completely exasperating experience with the backup and restore system. Neither the google drive nor the local backup able to get restored on the new phone. Not to forget the exhausting verification security system since I had to go back and forth just to get the chat restore working, which ultimately isn't. Media files are safe but had to manually copy and paste them to other places other than a phone."
"Please, going forward, can you device a way buy which people's status won't appear on my status bar, aside muting people. Please do that for us. Thank you. Happy New year"
"I had never had any issues with this app before but recently it starting acting up, I'm not getting some incoming notifications and it's not automatically saving media to the gallery."
"Fix the bug that doesn't allow one to post gifs on their status, also increase the quality of pictures and videos pleaseee its 2022, the media quality settings doesn't have any effect"
"Ok on a Samsung phone, so I get a banner with message from X and some words. I get option to reply, say OK, or mark as read. Doing any of these still leaves a blob on the app icon to say I have a message, even though I dealt with it in the banner. Not sure if this is Samsung or What's App issue?"
Always lags while we talk to more than one person sometimes it doesn't send messages even the network is good there are so many flws in this please try to correct them
they apps great but if you could just make it possible to see who is active one the chat screen without entering your contacts chat to see who is active it will be appropriated.
"I woke up to a notification from whatsapp saying ""some issue with your backup,restore chats now"" when i opened WhatsApp, it started glitching and all my chats were deleted. 8 years,20GB worth chats were deleted even though I had backup. Over the years I've changed 3 phones and could always restore chats. When I reinstalled whatsapp as instructed by support,no chats were restored and now only 31MB of data was showing as backup in settings. No solution provided by whatsapp."
Amazing. Especially the new features added. Nice job guys. But i would have given a 5 star Rating if the Video Quality of Calls where Improved.
Everything is good. You should add one function where we can block the status of other people. Mute is not enough.
WhatsApp has lost its way! Videos with audio in Status won't stop playing after exiting the app! Please have this checked! As its annoying when the audio kept playing after exiting!
"After update.. I'm facing a problem which during video call if i exit from full screen mode, then my face is locked at lower right corner. But in previous version i was able to fix my position at wherever i wanted. But after uodate it is locked please fix this"
"Can only use on 1 Andriod device. Just idiotic! Most people have a phone, a tablet as well as a PC or laptop, so it is not at all unsual to want to use WhatsApp on all of those devices throughout the day. I can use it on my PC and one Android device only so I have to pick between my tablet and my phone! Absolutely idiotic and a pity because WhatsApp is brilliant"
"This is a very useful app, and a very popular one in Asia. I would like to be able to input a number directly and begin a chat without having to add that person or business as a contact. It may be me, but that seems like a simple ask."
"Can't post videos to my status. It says ""Failed to process video, please try again later. If you keep seeing this message, please restart your device."" Already did, a bunch of times. And I can post videos at other social medias except for WhatsApp. There's no problem with posting pictures, but for videos, it can't process."
"I now find it difficult to open links after the last update. Error message"" you do not have a proper app for viewing this content"""
"Many things should be updated. After using WhatsApp for a long time, now several problems are appearing, one of them is,, if you talk for a long time, the conversation gets disconnected,, moreover, suddenly, if someone is online, it is not understood. Video call resolution is very poor. Everything else is fine."
"New update means I cannot attach a photo via the paperclip option as it only allows images that have been sent via WhatsApp. This means no camera, no screenshot, no photos from albums. Why?"
"The app is amazing. But, I and I think many people are having this problem, that when we see stutas, by clicking on the reply button, a message is sent to someone by mistake. I have one advice, (when we click on the reply button twice, the message will go to the other person only), if not, take some action from you. I think this little message of mine has reached you. And the rest is useful for WhatsApp app messages and many other tasks."
"This app is really awesome, it's very easy to use, easy to set and has an an assistant to assist you in case of any worries. Who wouldn't want to have an app as this for chatting with friends and others either worldwide or nearby. Would love to rate it 5 🌟 but can't because no app is perfect but that doesnt mean it doesn't deserve 5 🌟 😎"
"Worst messaging app on the market. Extremely outdated user interface, confusing settings and usage, extremely stupid system with only 1 account per phone number. So many other messengers like viber, telegram are infinitely better than this garbage."
"Can we have a separate tab for ""groups""? Just like we have for status and chat. Too many messages and everything is getting disorganized.... GB WhatsApp is thinking ahead, Gosh! 😭🤦🏾‍♂️ ...and you see that feature where you tap on someone's display picture and it takes you to their status, it's rubbish!!!"
"WhatsApp is one of the best messaging apps out there. It's free to use, there's no ads, love it. One thing I'd suggest is add a button to clear all system generated messages like “x added y to group”, “x changed number to y”, etc. These messages clog up chats and currently there's no way to get rid of them. And also add a button to clear all unnedded messages such as messages which were deleted for everyone, messages that contained media which cannot be downloaded anymore, etc."
"Sort the image insertion eh, why mess up something that worked perfectly fine the way it was. Idiots."
hope whatsapp can add function to see who's online just from chat list without open the chat... and please make new UI improvement to more fresh look & interesting because whatsapp use current UI in a long time that have no big changes...
"This app is not very convenient.Compared to this, GB WhatsApp has more features.WhatsApp is the same for the last 8 to 10 years. Only a few selected changes have happened in this time.I feel that in addition to chat, call, & status in this WhatsApp, group feature should also be added so that we can find some newness in it."
This app is very important for me. But nowadays I am facing a problem for which I contacted help line 4-5 times. Solution didn't work my vedio call get disconnected in between. If I try again it will not get connected neither vedio call nor audio through WhatsApp. Give me the Solution Thanks
"This is a very useless app intact it's very useless ,cant even allow you to put profile picture ,cant allow to few other people status . It's should be removed with an immediate effect .nkt !!!what a useless app !!!!!"
"Disappointed by WhatsApp/Meta approach to possible hacked accounts by punishing the victims and permanently disable all their accounts rather than a warning or bringing it to their attention. They have immediately disabled all my meta accounts without warning or any notice, for reasons they are unable to share, stating they received large number of complaints which must be 100% a result of a hack/identity theft, as I have no reason whatsoever to receive such complaints."
"Hey there, I personally feel that whatsapp is a good app for conversation. But recently I faced a kind of problem as I got to know that many of my friends are getting option to view status when they tap the dp but even after update I don't see that type of change in my whatsapp"
Sending pics is complicated now. They also take a longer time to appear in the gallery tab or recent.
"It's a good app for connecting with friends, family and feel reliable for talk to anyone ! But the current feature i.e. hide the online status just a veryy bad feature by which anyone use whatsapp most times we can't caught out"
"Now a days, i can not observe my recent photos while setting Dp or sending photos to others. I have to go to Gallery and send photos but i can't change Dp"
Hey WhatsApp! What about to create a option in status tab that users can create different list of people (like a song playlist) to see their status it's important Its my suggestion
Hello Mark Zuckerberg! My friend (Asif) in Pakistan is very angry on whatsapp Developers team. He has multiple Numbers and swipe everytime from one to another. He very annoyed that You should add SWIPE option in a Single APP So that he can use multiple Numbers on a Single App without deleting/Removing any account. We here in Chak No 211p are looking for this feature desperately. Your Efforts in this regard will highly be appreciated.
"The app is very good and all, but it will be very good to have some more costumizations or something. I know that the accent color I green but it will be a very big and different experience if you can app and option I chat to change the accent color to what ever color we choose and other stuff that you will find good to add but other than that, that is y I gave your app a 3 star rating."
"not receiving or sending message since the afternoon, although friends still can use their accounts. tried to re-installs, shut down multiple times, both app and device, still not working"
Stupid app It keep saying to restart my phone when I try to upload my status. I did restart and guess what... It didn't fix it. I use for family and friends in other countries that can't have a regular text messages
"In homescreen of the app, only last text should be shown with chats, and not what he or I reacted with. Previous update was better. Please zukerberg stop ruining whatsapp."
"After I updated it, it doesn't show any statuses and there is something wrong with the messages date."
"Since this app owned by meta. This thing has a lot of problems. For example it happened many times that there is no sign of incoming calls whatsoever. Suddenly there is a missed call. I've missed so much important call because of this. Don't blame my signal, every other apps work just fine when that happened."
This app doesn't have the option to select a preferred resolution for sending or posting media. The one in the settings is complete trash because it still doesn't do justice to what the user wants to deliver. If a user wants to send a media in 4k that's their choice. Make that possible even if it is for disappearing media. Do it for a start pls.
"I honestly don't understand why the pop-up notification option was disabled after this recent update, I honestly don't know why. This is actually one of the most important features in WhatsApp but it's been removed, why? I brought down the rating to 2 stars and if not fixed, one star 🚶🏻"
It's cool and simple app to use but I only use it for my family if you want a app to text like anyone else that's not important just use normal messages or snap chat besides that this is not a bad texting app
"WhatsApp is great, but lately the updates have consistently broken the app requiring a full uninstall and reinstallation to get backups and restores to work again. The dev honestly needs to just recommend manual reinstalls when it's that big of a change..."
"I would shoot a video or take a picture (highest quality) then I post a WhatsApp status,the quality is not as clean,the same way I shot it,why is that?"
"my account keeps getting temporarily banned and I am receiving no help from customer support, I have gotten conflicting messages, some of which say my account is running smoothly with no problems and some which say that I have an unauthorized and unofficial version of whatsapp even though I have told them repeatedly that this is impossible as I have downloaded from the link that was emailed to me by their official support team."
Amazing to text friends because you can use it to voice message or call even facetime really recommend but one thing I do suggest is maybe put like when you call you can do funny filters on like Snapchat 👍 👌
I share pictures in one group but unfortunately its share in other group also then i delete whats app and install again. Why this issue occurs i don't know.
"Suggestion : a lot of people write quotes or thoughts in their bio, so why not add a feature where people can like each others bio & can also see how many people (numbers) have liked other's bio & see who have liked their's (names)... Likes reset to 0 when one changes their bio or edits..."
"Very nice app, but when would the app be upgrade in way where you Don't have to use a cell number to sign up - but your Gmail account or some other account instead. I want to be able to access the same messages from Whatsapp - from other . Please and thank you......."
Sending file via WhatsApp that are not image or PDF often show as bin at other end. Especially dwg files. It is issue for almost 8 years and still not resolved.
"Was great until recent update. Now when you go to a group chat it opens at the most recent message rather than your first unread message so you have to scroll endlessly to fond when you were up to. It also stacks repeated messages from the same person without repeating the contact name so it can get confusing tracking who messages are from in a group chat, particularly when people send repeated messages or are replying to someone elses earlier comment. Please undo these changes!"
"it is the best way of communicating i would prefer, but recently i am have an issue refarding the notification. i am not receiving any notification while all other apps do and all the settings of whatsapp is trun on too. this is bit annoying. pls fix this"
"After the recent samsung update, watsapp has been unable to access my gallery of that day, the gallery is only able to access photos from the day before for attachment"
"The voice msg we are sending to the any person is not sounds like the normal ,it is playing very fast even while the listening voice runs very fast ,please fix this problem as soon as possible."
"Please include a feature such that Group Admin can restrict how many maximum messages can be send by anyone in the group. Because some people has the habit of sending 9-10 messages per day and my mobile keeps vibrating. Also, I don't want to mute the group because it is an important group for me to get notified about."
"Its a nice app but i have an issue with audio and video calls.. since i downloaded this app the audio and video calls are always connecting and i can't reach my third party Pliz can u fix this problem for me, I will appreciate"
I liked all the features in WhatsApp but only concern is why the photos or videos quality goes low after uploading it to dp or status. WhatsApp company should really take this seriously.
"The new feature in which you're not allowed to take screenshot in one view should be reverted. It's inconvenient. Also, WhatsApp should ask for a confirmation before sending a sticker🥲"
"After deleting a texts in whats app, thie undo of deleting chats/texts are not good. The old what's app was way more good than this. Please don't update useless things in what's app"
This app is so annoying... everything was ok when all of a sudden the app stop giving me messages or update statuses I can't even send message or receive Even when I uninstall and install it back I wasn't able to verify my number cause and it always says that whatsapp is unavailable try again in 5 minutes. Even after 5 minutes or more it still won't verify my number... pls fix this 😡😡
Videos are lagging Picture quality is real bad after loading it onto your status. Loading and viewing statuses are so slow
"After latest update if I delete some messagees from someone's chat then that chatbox is appearing in top against last message what I have deleted. Before that it was not like this, it was used to settle against last available message date and time."
"The app is amazing but it would be better if they added some new features like splitting the normal chat section and creating a group section and also adding a like ""❤️"" or any reaction option button to the status would be a great addition"
"Hi Developer...This is to inform you that when a poll is created group members are able to select all the options, which should not be there....you should give the option to select only one the options...not every options to be selected... Kindly do the needful."
Every thing is okay.... superb awesome functions.working smoothly.....but the app should update message edit functions as soon as possible..I hope to see the above mentioned update functions... thanks 👍
"This new update is totally trash It has made me loose alot of important messages and chat , cause of the automatic ""default message"" and everytime I turn it off ,by the time I go back there it will have automatically turned on again"
I teach class from this app by video call. I am a drawing teacher and i have a youtube channel where I post the video. Can you upgrade the app. I want a video recorder with it so when I teach my student I can upload the video on YouTube. Otherwise I have to do the class individual and upload. I think there might be other app but I don't want to keep many app for one work. So please help.
"Although whatsapp is good for chatting or calling.But, once I am using whatapp suddenly it's off and say that 'your account is not allowed to use due to spam'. I tried much but it doesn't open ."
"Suddenly can't access phones gallery to send photos/videos in a whatsapp conversation, only allows photos/videos from previous whatsapp conversations... Very annoying!! Hope you fix that very soon!!"
"Everytime i send a message and go out of the app,it does not send,but when i go into the app then it sends te message,plz fix this"
"It's a pretty simple and helpful app, my only problem with it is when it updates, which can be a hassle if all you want to do is send a message but it insists on being updated, and then the new version is just a little bit worse then before."
I'm really sad that my years of chat backup is gone when I switch to a new phone (android to android). It took me excruciating 8 hours to backup and restore and none of the chats were restored to the new phone. I did this a few more times and it failed. Such a painful experience 😭😭😭
Decent messaging app. Newest update screwed it up. I can't see my entire pic gallery when sending a pic and can only select one pic.
On Local Backup: Kindly make it that latest local backup usually overrides any other backup file found in the backup folder. i.e: my local backup is 1.5GB and this local backup is done daily at around 2am and at every daily backup same or similar backup file is added to the folder instead of having the new override the existing backup to save space and time.
Can we get a more features to customise the chat please!!! . I'm getting bored of the color palette and how little to nothing changed throughout all these years
After the recent updates I have a trouble in WhatsApp because when I delete the message for me the chat people members will be remain same contact these people will not be same. So WhatsApp can fix this problem
"Hi WhatsApp team! I am requesting you kindly separate groups from main chat. It is really annoying of someone have a lot of groups. I am studying in BS and every teacher has separate group. So, it is really hard to find main chat. It's a request kindly work on it. Your acts and response will highly be appreciated."
Use to be a great app I don't get these frequent updates. (If it ain't broke don't fix it). I hope these developers read these dissatisfied reviews and correct the issue if not just nuke the whole app. What's the point? The media options the voice notes etc... Like what genius approved this update. 🚮
Its a good app but there is a problem everytime i switch off my phone then i restart it once again...i open the app..it tells me the date is inaccurate...i go to the settings and nothing changes...until i uninstall and install it once again💔
"""Monthly"" Broadcast option maybe to Groups & Chats? So I would like a way if possible by the developers, to be able to send out a monthly broadcast on 3 specific dates each month. If this could be done it would help tremendously. Thanks for the service thus far still guys!"
Why don't you guys give us seperate tab for groups and seperate for personal chat 🙁 it's so mashed up. I have multiple groups from my office . Many time due to this mashed up layout I miss my important one on one communication . Please do the needful. Otherwise I have to shift from ragular WhatsApp to modded WhatsApp. Still no response after 2 months
I started the chat convertesion with me. But can't delete it now. This is a big problem on WhatsApp. Please fix this problem. thanks WhatsApp Team.
"Since the last update, I have not been able to open links directly from WhatsApp; I have to copy the link and paste in my browser, which is quite annoying, to be honest"
"I had been using this application for many years but I cut off using the app for a while, I want new features like status downloading , voice changer for voice massaging for the purpose of fun and locking the conversation then this app will might interesting for me 😊"
The new poll feature is excellent but it has it has some glitches like user can select multiple choices within the poll it's unfair enable single choice option and also stop from the user to add another vote on that particular pole Rectify these problems
"I hate the emoji reaction thing. I've reacted to things mistakenly so many times. It's really vulnerable to misclicks. Please make an option to turn it off, I don't even use it."
"I used to rate this app highly. There was a point where you were able to access previous device for information & then just sign back in on current device. I have now been locked out as it said my password for restoring messages is incorrect. I need a way to access recent messages, which may have been missed or just saved before the transfer. The option to log in and out of devices is so much better enabling people to juggle and refer back to previous/missed messages during the back up time."
WhatsApp is a very good app in my opinion but I lost all my messages and contacts after they told me to update. Now I can't even log in
Great but my mobile when i download the new update WhatsApp colors changed its color is not good and another phone same thing but another phone didn't make this with new update my mobile is vivo and the second oppo and the third samsung . Oppo and vivo changes colors and rest didn't change colors. Can you fix this problem please? I wish WhatsApp see this mail + A very very terrible problem why when i restart my phone most of the contacts on WhatsApp are deleted and i need to rename it again.
"In the latest update, the idea of Communities is good. But why make it work like a group. If it is ment for announcements, it should be like a broadcast. Everyone I had in groups got a notification that a group has been created. Sorry I suggest to improvise & make it like a broadcast to groups (that makes a community) for announcements."
"Why does your App feel like I am hacked or someone is using my account for their personal gain whilst reading my chats and listening to my Voice notes. This other day I updated a 24hour status but to my surprise I couldn't view it anymore in the next 15 hours, it had disappeared but my contacts could still view it..."
Iam upset with the new update becaus when iam clicking on others dp it shows status of person so iam not able to see his profile. My only problem is thàt u have to remove that new feature this is my kind request to developer
"It use to be ok but not anymore . Argued with my wife for not answering my calls and she was keep telling me that her phone didn't rang . I tried one time while both home and what happened actually was that I could hear in my phone that I was calling her bat her phone was not ringing , I had her phone in my hand while calling her nr and wasn't ringing . A minute , maybe 2 after I hanged up she got notification of a missed call . Happened a million times so no .... It's RUBBISH !"
"After updating my WhatsApp, once every week, the app tells me that i am on a temporary ban from using whatsapp for a minimum of 6-8 hours which can be very frustrating. Can you fix this issue. This morning i have been in a gym and hardly used the app, but now it has gone into a temporary ban mode again. This app is becoming rubbish to say the least. Kindly fix this or go back to previous stable versions. To make matters worst the C. Service never replies back. Just happened again barely 24 hours"
"This is a great app in most ramifications. Kudos to the developers. I actually wanna comment on the latest update with the ""Poll feature"" One can vote for all options (that's renders polls useless, what's the point?) One can vote and unvote(so bad, one needs to be able to vote once, not unvote after) One can see other users votes when one hasn't vote (this influencesthe independent choice of user when voting) One can see people who vote and the options they voted for (votes shld b Anonymous)"
Android 13 - Needs to sort images out. every time I try to add a camera image to a message. I now have to add it by share on my gallery app.
When I make calls they are keep disvonnecting every 15-30 seconds. But if i recieve there is no problem.
"It's great for fast messaging and stuff, but I'm very annoyed with how it changes settings without my consent, such as permanently putting one of my contacts on mute with all attempts to unmute them in particular being futile, or selectively changing notification settings by itself, or not selecting the correct photos I intend on sending to people this past week. What happened? Why's it suddenly so buggy? Why is the troubleshooting process not helping?"
"WhatsApp is a good app i am using it as a messenger from a long time ago but now, It's showing me temporarily banned for 1 Hour. Frequently without any reason. I have raised a complaint in whatsApp support but they have told me i am using unofficial version of whatsApp, But i have tried so many time to update and reinstall it from play store, and also i have never used any other source whatsapp, so it's perfectly a issue which I am facing, there support don't have reply option please reply me!"
"Past few months, whatsapp camera doesn't works good because whenever I take pictures to send,it is not clear. I thought this problem only for me but many users having this same problem...even after every updates I'll check the camera quality but it remains same🙃"
This is good application . For chatting video calling and other feature . But one feature is not good 'Block'
"Dear meta group whenever I send a message to someone and I then delete it,it goes back because of the date it was sent but now it shows in the top it is really annoying pls fix it"
"App was fine before the recent update Can no longer see when someone was last online/currently online, despite the setting being enabled Messages are also not being delivered straight away even though the recipient is online and has the app open."
"good app. This is for devolopers... can you update this app for use polls...can you add new item for attachments named with ""poll"". if you can do it i will be grearful to you.. Thanks wtz app."
I forgot my passwords for back up and there is no option to get it back for eg..all my previous chats photos and videos too of all my contacts. So I lost all of it.if we forgot our email password...we are having an option to get it in forgot password options and in what's app nothing like that...it's better if they have some option to get the old history of chats and all...because there is possibility for human error...we can forgot passwords...so they must have some option for it...
I find the WhatsApp really good for keeping in an especially if you don't have any free text on your phone it's a good way to so happy new year and keep up the good 👍
"Ever since the last version update, I can't attached images from gallery but only from other chat's media. Even when attaching and choosing the camera, the only camera history is the chat's media !!!"
"Bloatware data-collecting spyware. It drains the battery, makes notification sounds randomly to grab your attention, and keeps disconnecting the bluetooth. Zuckerberg is an antichrist robot lizard and someone needs to shut him down to save humanity! We can use the scrap to make cute blinking squeeky toys sorta like Chucky but without the evil AI."
"Getting a lot of faults on it these days. Used to work flawlessly, not so much anymore. Sticking with it though."
"The app keeps crashing. I have tried to install the latest update, this did not help. And there is no option to downgrade to previous update. Can't open, click on or respond to new messages. Or view /click old messages. Error message ""WhatsApp is not responding"". I was typing midchat and it froze, now I am stuck in this infinite loop of restart, open, crash. Rinse and repeat. Very frustrating. Please send a bug fix"
"Recently (the past 2 months) I have not been able to use whatsapp on my phone, it glitches every time I go on the app, I can't tap on chats, settings, status etc.. the only way I can stay in contact with my contacts is if I use whatsapp on my computer. And if the app does start working on my phone like normal, the glitching would start again in 10 minutes time. I have also deleted the app multiple times and it works fine for about a 5 minutes and then starts back again. I've tried everything."
"Love this app, but now with the latest version when I write something long on my status it goes to the left side, and in hebrew it's on the wrong side, it used to always be in the middle, I would rather it be like before but if you do this then give the option to move it to any side we want"
"What exactly is the purpose of this app? It does not allow you to create a new phone number; it simply shoehorns itself onto your existing phone number, which is required in order to even use the app. This app is nothing but a worthless middleman that allows Meta more intrusion into your life. No thanks."
"Hello... I have recently seen that the backup takes way too much time. It is really big problem and when the sim is on roaming what's app doesn't backs up on cellular data , why so ? I would really request to consider this review n work on . Thank you 😊"
"Generally great, use it as my preferred way to communicate with friends and family, but do have a couple of complaints: 1. It often uses mobile data even when connected to wifi (like right now when I'm sat 2ft from the router). 2. Would be nice to have the option to view media without downloading it."
"Hello Whatsap team, Give update to store the downloaded Medias in perticular folder path or in whatsap folder. Now when i download some media it will directly saved to gallary.In last updates if we use delete for everyone, it will delete that copy from album too. But its not working now. Deleted copy will remains in album.It will messup with other camara photos/videos. Give update for that to fix that."
Looking for a better app. Calls drop. Screen is always blurry. Can't really hear the inherent person. Have to talk loud all the time.
This app is very helpful for communicating with other but is some problem also for example if anyone wants to share someone 80 photos then it tells that u can only share 30 photos at a time then we will have to share 3 times and it becomes very annoying and one more problem that someone has already posted so please fix both the problem immediatly as soon as possible
"Videos from gallery are not showing on whatsapp any photo which I have taken immediately is not showing me on whatsapp giving me a lot of problem and if I want to send a screenshot etc.So when I have to go to the gallery and share it, it gets sent to WhatsApp only"
"What a waste feature you have introduced for deleting messages. If I'm deleting a message, I don't want to inform the receiver, So why don't you simply delete the message without keeping a message which says ""You deleted this message."" I know, that I've deleted that message, So you don't need to worry about it, Just delete it. Don't let them know. Don't make the sender feel that they've made a mistake. Stupid and nonsense feature 😐"
"“Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try”. The students of the Adult Basic Education School at Lincoln Community Center are the most diligent, hardworking, amazing people I have ever gotten the privilege to meet. As I chose to volunteer teaching English as a second language, this was the most rewarding experience I have ever encountered. I have learned more than I have ever hoped for. I have encompassed many skills that I will be able to use the rest of my life. The students attend"
It's a great app. Whenever I priavacy set in last seen restricted mode. I will not able to see their last seen and others unsaved contact also. I want only that person can't see my last seen and another all contacts are lible in both sides. If we can't see the last seen of some unknown person or he cannot see our last seen. Then there is no use in providing these features.
"Can we get actual updated... More QoL, features, move some stuff around, simplify some things. Whatsapp is cool, and vluseful, but it's a nightmare sometimes to do much other than send texts."
Now adding/sending pictures and videos is a challenge. The media display does not show pictures and videos in certain folders.
"Fix the gif results window size. It used to be half the size of my screen when I closed the keyboard and now is just a fifth of it, is hard to see the results, already contacted support and after a while trying to explain the issue multiple times, they told me that is the way intended to be, but I think it was better before."
After the recent update this app becomes real bad full of bugs and I am facing the baddest of all time issue that my what's app using realtime camera view as background wallpaper And support service is so bad
The latest update is bad. The messages don't show read until after the next text even when we're in the chat. What is this community tab? And the gallery doesn't update to most recent images.
"latest update keeps crashing the Camera app after using the built-in camera in chat, and constantly disconnects Bluetooth wherever there's a voice call over Whatsapp"
"Yeah.. Its good.. But it should have an option to mark a ""message as unread"". It should be a feature to save the time for low priority messages we used to get."
Ridiculous update of the minimizing feature which fixes our own video at one place. Earlier it was much better. Please see to it @whatsapp. I hope I get the old whatsapp back which allowed me to smchange the position of my own video so that I can get a clear view of the other person from wherever I want....
The new update is very bad.The message that are deleted in the chat remains at the top which is creating problems for me.please fix it as soon as possible or else I will delete it.
The app is good but there is some glitches in video calls the screen become stuck can't back or minimise the call and disconnect I have to say other person to disconnect that's not good.
Very bad update after this update i can't see any one last seen and is that online or offline. There is very sensitive to know about some one.
"I am facing problem in while using whats app on desktop after the recent update that I am anle forward any messages, pictures or documents. Also it got hung up when I drop fown any file from the drive."
My account since 2 months till from then it hasn't recovered I'm only getting the mail we have removed the bann but still it haven't remove it... please do something i haven't done anything wrong i have followed your terms and conditions still your WhatsApp team has ban it...i hope you see my situation because it very important to me the important message I'm missing so please
"I've updated to the recent version and I couldn't chat anymore. Neither the network nor the WiFi would work. So, I uninstalled and reinstalled but now I can't even insert my phone number. It says WhatsApp is unavailable"
THE BEST chat line is what's up I don't mess with you they don't bother you you can send stuff out no problem but if you're doing something wrong they will get on you and let you know but besides that they're very cool understanding and respect your privacy it's one of the best out of all the apps I have tried and I'm still using it thank you
Was a very good app to communicate with family and friends share pictures videos. upload videos photos in status with the latest update this app only good to text
"There should be a music icon on the status setting whenever we post picture, we can use the music in the picture just like Instagram status has ."
"I was using whatsapp messenger from long time and i thought to use business now so i backed up all data first n then downloaded whatsapp business app thought i'll transfer all my data to the business one. After downloaded the app, logged in the app i could not find my backup data. I went to chat backup tapped on my account and there it said you don't have any backed up data in the selected email id so add new acc. Rn i am completely gone mad. Hell with whatsapp and it's team. I lost my all data"
"In new update, when you are on video call and you put it on popup mode your face comes in bottom of it and you couldn't darg it anywhere else . It was good before that even in popup mode you could drag your face to any corner. But now when you are in popup mode your partners face gets covered by yours as it is always at the bottom."
"Very easy and user friendly app. I use it every day for work. Highly recommended for international texting, calling, and video chat."
"New update has made sending media a nightmare, have to go through gallery and send that way rather than just through the app like last time. Please change back."
I don't know what is this.But my photos and videos from whatsapp is not saving in my phone gallery.My media visibility is on.Everything is on point.But i don't know why is this happening.If you can fix this or solve this please do asap.
"I really love this app and it's functions, but the calls are really blurry and I can barely see the other people I call on video call, pls, fix that."
Nonsense update I don't want to backup my data and yet everytime it is asking to choose the frequency and also when one is not interested in payments why it is promoting to use it.resolve the issue
Why can't I see images without having to download them. They end up taking way too much space after a while. It's super annoying and apparently this is only and android issue. Brainless developers running this app
"Whatsapp is a great form of communication locally and internationally. However the recent updates are a pain. The voice notes do not go ""private"" when you put your phone to your ear and some videos come through without their sound. Please fix this."
After recent updation my incoming calls getting declined automatically. It's so weird and my friends think iam disconnecting their calls. Tried using wifi and restart options but problem still persist.
"Worst app ever, uploading personal information and contacts from our phone without asking our permission and there is no option of deleting from whatsapp. I'm gonna delete this spy app"
"Do the developers of this app not know what caching is? Because I don't want to download every single video and picture someone sends to me just to look at it. It's not that hard to cache it in RAM or even storage as temp files, if someone wants to download it then you move it to storage. Will give off the appearance that download speeds have increased."
"Was a very helpful app before the updation, after updating watsapp the message we delete from the chat is gone but that chat name is on the top after deleting msg, i don't know what to do,"
"I like the app Actually but since the last uptade, the chats are not organized according to the dates and it is unreasonable. We demand the former regulation for chat Organization . Regards"
"After new update, while deleting new msg but contact is showing on top. It should be went on descending date order. Please give us new update to fix it."
"The back up of whatsApp is the worst part, it doesn't give a proper back up, sometimes the contacts or the photos or the chats are not gained back by the back up. Infect the whatsApp is the imp app for those purpose but not using the app as frequently as I used it before the back up."
I'm having issue to do video call or voice call with one specific person. Every time I call him the call used to cut automatically after showing unavailable. Please solve my problem
Very good app for communication with each other either for business purposes or in university or any other study circle forum. I recommend to us this app. 😎😎😎😎😎
"They are adding useless features time by time. What is the point of admin being able to delete someone's message? Remember most of the teens and family friends people use whatsapp not a bunch of 1000 professionals. There's no need to. And only admin being notified if someones leaves the group, another useless feature, the ""simple, reliable, private"" era is gone for WhatsApp"
Good but sometimes we can't unsend msg or delete after seen. On the other hand when I reply without open the app most of the time it not goes 🙂. Backup should to be more improve.
please improve the quality of the picture when sending it to friends/contacts.. with high-quality pictures/screenshorts etc.
Absolutely pathetic. Cannot backup! Stuck at the same % shown for at least fifteen minutes. Zero stars given as a result. But unfortunately this is not possible and so one star. ONLY!
"Notifications are broken. What I mean: Notifications sometimes appear, have sound and etc, but sometimes they appear, don't have sound and disappear soon. However I can't really complain since notification code might have errors and is in try-catch block. And I hate the fact that your message will become ""This message was deleted"" after deleting it. Like, why do you even code such stuff? A deleted message should be completely invisible to everyone, not so everyone can see that you deleted it."
"I don't even know what's going on. Messages are not going through or being able to send. Random glitches, the audio record button is also bugged."
"This app is no more private.. Plus the worst experience I had with its customer support services. Account got banned without any cause at the moment I needed it most.. So, hell with this app... I'm going to have alternate app like telegram which is having full privacy. Thanks Telegram.."
the app is good..its easy to texting people..but can you make an update where you can change your theme to any colour??i really need it because my least favourite colour is green..i feel like the green theme in whatsapp dosent fit my aesthetics
Disappeared option is a bug. This option should be applied only for individual or Admin. Not everyone in the group. It should be only applicable to everyone if it gets changed by admin not a normal group member. If an individual wanted to disappear option then it should work only for his phone not everyone in that group. Please kindly have a look on this bug and fix it ASAP
It wont let me send videos that i recorded and send pics it says to try again or restart the pjone still dont work i tried to uninstall and then reinstall and still dosent work you need to fix this
"There's a recent bug in WhatsApp where whenever you're scrolling, it automatically jumps up multiple days. Please fix it."
"Nice app, I have been using it for years, but I think we should have a feature that can make us choose whose status we want to see and not see, muting is not the best we can get... Give us a feature to stop seeing a particular status again."
"I did not like just one thing....... that..... if we chat with anyone, so obviously there names will be come the uppermost in the chat section. But after deleting the msg from the same chat, there names still remains there, which I did not like......"
Annoyingly it's not picking up recently taken photos to upload in the app. Have to do it manually from the camera app. Fold 3
"Dear Development team, Please provide feature to mention all people in the group at once. Because of this, my friend was mad at me for not mentioning him. Best regards, WhatsApp User"
"After the recent update, unable to see messages in chronological order. Has raiaed a TT with WhatsApp team, but no solution."
I gave Whatsapp 4 starts because i think that Whatsapp have to add an option on profile photo setting that (select people who can only see you profile pic ) . Kindly add this option
Hide media option doesn't work in Google photos. Google photos shows WhatsApp media always. Fix it.
Chat feature- there was a feature which continuesly play voice messages in group chat until end of the voice messages. But now I play one by one which so annoying when lots voice messages in a group. Such shame loosing this useful features
"Used to be great, now it's horrible. I send a lot of photos through WhatsApp and now it's a nightmare.... Made the app useless for me now..."
Latest version is useless. start chat select contact then NOTHING. Returns back to the start chat screen. I shouldn't have updated! App has all privileges enabled btw. Sony Z5 compact.
"Like what is exactly wrong with WhatsApp?? I can't upload my display picture anymore after the new android update and can't even seem to locate my camera pictures as I used before 😔 so I dnt know if its the android settings or WhatsApp itself. Pls how can I upload my picture on my dp(it keeps saying ""this picture can't upload now, try again later""??🤷‍♀️"
"There's a notification that my whatsapp version is out of date, but there's no update option in playstore. Suddenly I canot open the app, and I have to download an update that didn'texist! My phone is not that old, and the update version was compatible with my phone. Because I really need to contact my family, I uninstall and reinstall it, but since I can't go inside the app, I can't create any backup, and all my chat history is GONE!!! My local backup is also ""automatically"" rewritten"
"Can you please improve or allow it to be controlled on settings, the issue of voice notes. When I play voice notes within a minute instead of playing on speakers it plays on phone call speaker which the volume is slow. Sometimes when using the phone, when screen turns off and when moving the phone."
"enough privecy and I like it... also it's easy for me to send photos, video and music. And also I think it would be great if there was and ""hiding option"" for hiding messages 😊"
"I cant edit contact name. Fix it! I cant turn off the vibration when taking picture, what a dumb and absolutely pointles ""new feature"". Please fire whoever come up with that idea!"
I hate this app All my messages have disappeared from my contacts and Man other people And I cannot restore them I would never use this app again as it's causing the worst problem's
"A Big Thanks to WhatsApp for Bringing the feature 'Admin. can delete the Message' on our Request... Your WhatsApp is very Helpful in our Daily Activities.... And Now since it's growing, we need one more Feature, a Notification Feature for Group, Sometimes we post the Notification in the Group but when we continue discuss anything those Notification will be left off, many Members use to Missed the Notification... At present I have to notify to my Group members through the Group Description."
I'm having a problem. Every time my phone goes off I have to re-register and its gives me 24 hours without using WhatsApp. Fix this please
Huge number of problem added with this update. Too many times reconnect in full wifi or Mobile Mb support. Please check & resolve it as soon as possible.
"The app is good, can you please make the status update videos more than just 30 seconds? Like 1 minute or 2 at least. Thanks in advance"
It's a really good app. If it has 2 saparate chat section one for personal chat and other for group chat then it will be really helpful.
Latest update is very bad. Its taking mutch time to upload a video in status and somtimes i see double messge in my sending and after comeback it is again single its giving me a confusion meny time
"I don't know if it is a WhatsaApp bug or Samsung/Android bug but when you use the DUAL MESSENGER feature of Samsung to use Whatasapp and select USE SEPARATE CONTACT LIST option, you can only add the most of 89 contacts to this list. If you add more than that, the 90th contact not only does not show in the DUAL MESSENGER, but it also automatically deletes that contact from the mobile. This bug creates a lot of chaos as it deletes important contacts from the mobile."
"After the last update, send pictures is a struggle and videos it can't be send, showing message saying to restart my device which I did but still showing same message, don't know what to do."
"Worst app ever, unable to restore backup properly, even stored in drive too. To restore backup files requires uninstall is mandatory this is too much wasting time. If more that two three times install taking 7hrs time to verifycation process. Lot of bugs r there"
"Keeps spamming my gallery with media send by other people, the media visibility setting does nothing at all. Why would anybody wants to see random gifs sent by somebody in some WhatsApp group to automatically appear in your business slack? That's purely insane and extremely annoying. Using WhatsApp on more than one device is cumbersome. Backup just ""freeze"" all the time, you won't even get a notification about that, so you never know if your chats are backed up or not ..."
Of late my WhatsApp has been hanging. I wonder what the problem could be. I have been trying to send messages only for the messages to take a while or not go at all. Something is amiss with this new version.
I like the fact that the messages that have been deleted stay that way and my experience with whatsapp has been amazing. Also it connects me to my friend even when I'm not able to see that face to face It's awesome
Green circle ring in fhats is not working in my phone after updating what's app also not working that new update.. Tried a lot again n again uninstalled also but not working that green circle ring in chats on what's app
I was not getting notification sound on recieving msg... I tried all setting option available told by whatsapp support...even did all reset still my problem was not solved... whatsapp didn't solved my problem as i asked for help on mail...i came up with my own solution....they told me my phone is having compatibility issues...they were wrong... whatsapp doesn't fix ur issues .. Thanks Regards Harjeet kaur
"You know everything.. what can I say..I just want a on and off option available for WhatsApp so I can enjoy a little privacy from the world trying to connect so desperately. I would like to choose when to receive msj and when to not. So I'll be online doing my other work, but don't get any msj from WhatsApp until i finish."
I have using this app since 2015 but never have any major problem but from last 2 weeks whenever I pickup any call ar did any call only after 1 minutes other person voice vanished and there is no sound and it's happen again and again and again I had to disconnect and call back but same problem occurred again and again and neither i have any internet issues nor the person whom I call so ALL PROBLEM IS IN WHATSAPP please solve this biggest problem it's really hard to talk on watsapp.
"As updates flow in it is becoming so easy to click the wrong button. Usability should be more considerate. I also want to request a feature to 1. Flag items / add items to calendar eg: if a message comes for meeting /class schedule, we should be able to add it directly to the calendar or set reminder 2. Select and copy part of a message 3. Delete message from the notification without opening the app. This option is available for SMS app and I use it all the time."
"""Restore chat history Something went wrong with your chat history. Don't worry, you can restore your chat history from backup. If you don't restore now, you won't be able to restore later. SKIP RESTORE RESTORE "" I am finding this problem on my phone . please tell me how to fix it? It has harmed me last fortnight also after that I staterd to take backup and now even I am not able to restore my chat . Everytime I tries it crashes and same thing (pasted above) appears."
"Please upgrade the video call, it must have video call effects like the Samsung A73 for example: blur the background or an option to put a picture in the background. Otherwise good app this is."
"i have an updated version of whatsapp application (2.22.21.83) in my ""mi 10 t pro"". but the latest options & features like ""who can see when i'm online"" & ""status view option on DP"" are not being reflected in the application. kindly do the needfull."
"My notifications are turned on, and yet, it doesn't make any sound wen I get messages Why? This is so annoying"
Introducing disappearing messages. Now you can set chats to disappear after 7 days. * Search your stickers with text and emoji or categories. * Decorate your photos and videos with smoother drawing and new alignment guides. * Now you can set a custom wallpaper for a chat or set a dark mode wallpaper. Choose from a refreshed wallpaper gallery or new colors over the doodle background
"Four times the new update has refused to be installed into my phone. Trouble shooting options say I have uninstall the current version and install WhatsApp anew, but I will lose important chatsxif I did that. (And my messages weren't backed up because WhatsApp was always buggy when it came to that) Please what do I do?"
"Even though my WhatsApp chats are backed up daily, WhatsApp is continuously showing backup error and then stops working immediately, from the past few days. It is very frustrating."
Not satisfied with app features there are totally unattractive And I really hope new stuff will be added like 1.separating personal chats from that of groups 2.advanced notifications like online notification that will be better than always opening a chat to verify if they are online Viewed status notifications Changed profile notifications 3.text correction after been sent so one doesn't keep on deleting messages It's a high time developers need to bring in new stuff 💪
Actually this is happening with me more than 6-7 times when my friend messaged me but I didn't receive any message. And also rather than showing correct online status and last seen it shows wrong information...Plz do something...And i am using latest version of whatsapp but still this problem is there
It's not good because my notification are not shown at the top of the screen I also switched out all my notification What's the problem because I also update my app but there is also an arror why watsapp notifications are not shown at the top of the screen and when I heard the voice messesges there is a ringtone which I completely ringing when I heard voices it completely disturbed me
What happened to the search feature?! List of search results closes when on of the result is selected. Very annoying! Pls bring back the old feature wherein the search list is diplayed until it is closed. Rating has come down due the mentioned experience.
A recent experiencing microphone intermitten problem lead to a sudden termination of a progressive call. Please rectify and it will be perfect. thanks
This App will let someone ring me but as soon as you go to answer you ar cut off on my Samsung A51. It also doe the same to the wife Samsung its that bad we have told people not to ring us up on WhatsApp.Yet we can receive messages whats going on.
"I am facing some issue with WhatsApp which gives me the worst kind of experience, it shows backup your messages or skip it... But after i backup i am not able to backup the messages of todays chat.... So so dissapointed with the whole whatsapp team because there i have some of my important files and messages which are deleted"
"Stopped recognizing photos from phone galleries after the last Android upsate, but rather only shows photos that were sent or received via whatsapp. It's really annoying and hurts the user experience."
Can't send multiple photos from my phone galleries anymore. What kind of garbage is it? The most stupid UI I have ever seen.
"Great app to stay in touch with family and friends. However for the past 1 week I'm experiencing an issue. Although I've always had my last seen disables, of late I can't see if my friends are online or while they are typing or sending audio messages. It's quite annoying."
Great place to talk to friends if not close to them. Also has alot of diffrent features that are really cool
Hello whatsapp I am unable to access my account again. This keeps happening everyday. Can you please assist and sort this out for me. You keep saying it was flagged by mistake. Hope to get it fixed. Thank you
"Yes I have been using WhatsApp since 5 years now, and there wasn't much bad to share, but I have a suggestion 1.Whenever we delete a message for everyone the message with time remains there it doesn't dissappear complety 2.There should be an edit option for the sent message (this can make it better, for ex typo or smth autocorrect) Only these I would suggest rest the application is fine"
"I'm having an issue with the 'reaction notification'. It's quite annoying to receive a notification, everytime someone reacts to your messages. I tried turning it off, but it appears, it made no difference. I'm still receiving the reaction notification, even after turning it off. One more thing, I noticed that if we or the other person, reacts to the last message sent, it appears on the main page of WhatsApp as 'Reacted to: (message)', under their name. I would prefer the message itself."
Those reactions are really annoying. They are obstructive since they are located at the top of the reply/message. I always accidentally hit them. Take the reactions away or make them less obtrusive
I can't view status on this new updated WhatsApp. It keeps saying media storage space full. How is WhatsApp status related to my storage space?
"After the recent update, I am having problems downloading the still photo whereas there is enough storage. Though the videos are downloading"
"No able to get any notifications on my phone and in whats app setting its saying no pop up notification your version doesn't support, i have check my phones setting done a reset and even reinstall whats app but its same. I am usin A52 latest edition"
Call is not working and suddenly between calls it hung.. can't hear any voice.. same issue with whatsup business version as well. This is happening from Nov 17th 2022 after upgrading android software.. pls fix or provide solution to fix.
The status are not deleting and I am unable to posty recent status......it is from last 30 minutes... Plz solve this... After update of latest version status is not deleting and not sending.....plz solve it...Message is also not going and last seen also not showing... Overall after update the app is not working properly....
I don't know what to say again. I contacted support etc. Any of my messages whether a friend or a group chat just randomly dissappears. And no the disappearing feature is not on. I change phone change Sim delete reinstall whatsapp no help. My wife important messages dissappears my uni group chats dissappears and these are important to me . I'm so frustrated. And hope whatsapp could help me
Your app is unreliable. I talk to a friend in Qubec Canada. I have as number of messages that are still waiting to be sent and a number from him still waiting to be received! He tells me that his WhatsApp is broken so we have moved to a different app. Lift your game fellas or you will continue to lose customers.
"Have been using the app for quite along time all through online time, but sometimes updating status pictures and videos take so long. Had tried to create a group, but my account was ""Spammed"", trying again to tap and try to create the group, the apo stopped running. It took me down! Lost all data and media. Trying to restore and getting into the app, it unfortunately stops running."
After this update app is working perfectly fine. Lots of new features are there for our privacy which is really nice. But according to me there is one problem that me can't use our WhatsApp account in to phones at the same time. Therefore the community should think about this update.
"It's a very helpful app for communication. But,getting this app updated frequently is bit of a problem."
Media Multi-select is no longer available. I have to go to gallery all the way to push multiple pics. This is a downgrade rather than an upgrade.
"It's very useful for video calling, send photos, send messages... Share status photos with friends & relative and everything this app is very useful.... And so many blah blah blah..."
It's a good application for messages type.. i wish it can add some of themes for chat and add some settings at status..
So much frustrated with the app one day working and another day not really disappointed. Even I complained but there is no solution. Very much disappointed
"New update is dog water. When i download a video or image and i want to send it to someone through WhatsApp, my camera roll doesn't open up in the app, can't see my recent saved tiktokvideos/downloads"
"One of those rare things in life that ""just works"". As smartphone apps go, virtually flawless, never breaks. Does exactly what it says, and does it well."
"It's a great application and I absolutely love it, but am only asking if more features for status privacy can be included like if it can be possible for us to creat groups for a certain number of contacts to veiw the status....."
I can no longer pick my gallery items from the status page. The app is frequently crashing since the last update on Dec. 5
The new update is interesting and fun.. But the issue that I would like to mention is that whatsapp supresses the images send through it...if developers could work on that it would be great
Reliable and easy to use. Connecting with people has been made easy...no irritating adverts or time to time restart. Also good for privacy.
"I have no issues the app per se. But I was wrongfully banned, because the app suspects me of using an unofficial version, while I am a 100% sure I am using the authentic app from Google play store. Please fix this. I really don't want to encounter this problem again."
My whatsapp was tracked by whatsapp tracker 3rd party app. It shows that my whatsapp was active today morning 3am & 7am. But my mobile was not being used at that time. Mobile whatsapp app timer shows that i wasnt online at that time. This is confusing. I have written to all whatsapp supports even twitter official page also. I need a feed back
"No help available whatsoever. When requesting call to verify account, just hangs up immediately then suddenly you have to wait hours and hours to receive a verification sms. And support responds in ""a few days"". Absolutely terrible support system."
It would be better if it didn't demand your contacts to add people. Because when I try adding new contacts it acts like they don't exist. Just let me look up a number and send them a message on here. It's easier to use social media...
"During whatsapp video call I can't change call voice to earphones 🎧, It is always on speaker 🔊 and WhatsApp is not giving me any options to change it to earphones 🎧"
"love my whatsapp... Suddenly i cant hear what the other person is saying, my android has sound , they hear me perfect . both on audio and video. yes my sound is on my mute is off . this happened last week i see there was a release of new version. i just wonder if these may be the root cause? any one else have this issue"
So far my experience was good until my account was being consider spam for no good reason and now I cant send and receice messages. This is really stressful and pushing me to leave the app and use any other platform which doesn't consider You as false user. Thank you🌹
The Latest update seems to have stopped the ability for me to see my most recent gallery photos so that I can send them in a message.
I can't record a voice note using this app ...after updating the app and the worst part is that I had to even uninstall and install the app and it's still doing the same thing...it very annoying 💔
The app is great and all that....but I would like to request that it should be possible for one to off his/her online status to because......even if I mistakenly enter the app and my data is on it will show that am active and someone else will be thinking online and available for chat or something I hope this request will be granted
"After I updated the app some days ago, it has refused to open on my phone and it keeps popping up a message saying WHATSAPP HAS STOPPED or WHATSAPP KEEPS STOPPING."
"Waiting for new features like tagging @everyone in a group chat instead of tagging every group member individually, Sometimes in group chat important message are missed without such feature."
"The new update is really irritating and tough. There's no need to view status by clicking the dp. We just want to directly look the dp. Now if I want to see dp, then it's a big process. Please WhatsApp, remove this update of going to status through dp. Else everything is fine"
Whats wrong with whatsapp now. Unable to open videos/photos by recent manner when I want to share as story. Very Bad.
"This app is not working it's getting worst day by day... I'm facing here so many issues after updating this app... The pictures , audios ,videos and other media are not downloading in this app and it's just wasting my time and efforts hated this app."
"Great UI and options for communication, including new ability to text oneself."
"When I tap the name of a group to know about that, the app is working correctly. But in the case of an individual contact, a blank black page is shown and return to that chat. I think there is a bug in the code. Please rectify. Update: Now it's rectified automatically. But why it happened sometimes back."
"Had a amazing update.. Please upgrade WhatsApp status, viewers how many times they are watched and download option would be nice if it could be done."
I love this app very much If you develop this app that all of us can put our photo along with song I think most of all exite that. Thank you
Now a days if we delete some of the latest messages from a conversation that chat is not going down in the list as per the date of existing latest messenge in that chat.
"This app is ok, it makes it easier for me to talk to my friends but when i uninstalled it i couldn't install it again. Also i never get my calls because it doesn't ring. Please fix these problems."
WhatsApp is missing several features. It'd be extremely great if they add them. Features are as below Edit messages button Hiding Online status Permanently deleting messages without anybody seeing that a message has been deleted. Material You integration to change App colors No limit to send any file
After update WhatsApp I couldn't find new features of status. That is status can also view by clicking on dp also !! Kindly check it
"I have set profile picture. But shows blank for me. But when i checked from others phone , my picture is visible to them. And once after the status Update the app automatically closes."
Was very simple to use. But then it kept saying after the second day that I to install. Everything I downloaded disappeared and had to start over again. Not worth it to me. Work the kinks out and it might be ok
"I want the new version of app but it is not updating! Although, the app is great but I can only write a five- line status on it. So, I am giving it only three stars!"
Unacceptable. Can't even get it to generate a verification code. OK button behaves exactly the same as the Edit button.
"Recent update is very bad, I am not able to upload image in chat or in status from camera and screenshot folder."
"Hi team, Please do bring below privacy features 1. Online status should be visible only to contacts who are in our contact list (Since lot of business/organization/ NGO people started to do marketing over whatsapp they are distrubing the people by checking their online status) 2. Video call should be disabled for contacts who are not stored in the receiver ends directory 3. All business account should have opt-out feature so we stop receiving message at anytime Thanks"
Writing on behalf what i am facing since last 2-3days My account is getting banned again and again after regular intervals afyer sending e-mail to support team it get unbanned but that is for few hours. I never used any third party app or anything which violates their policy. From last three days my life is like wokeup get it done unbanned and do it at regular intervals. Please help users to permanently fix if it is mistakenly happened by your team.
"After the Latest update, conversation we delete the whole profile goes to the last date it was chat ....now if the Latest conversation is deleted the profile is shown there only.....need to update this ..."
"Statuses and profile pics looking terrible on Android, image quality drops heavily after uploading to WhatsApp, don't know if it's an Android issue, but very disappointing"
My WhatsApp is banned from last 15 days but no one is taking is seriously that was haked I am using this since almost 10 year I have not done anytype voiloation in WhatsApp but still not getting back my WhatsApp I have sent so many emails to the support team but not get the taking my still banned 🚫 . I have requested them many time also explain them that I have not done any type wrong activity but recovery system is not good . I will record a video for it that whole team not responsible bad .
"Wow,thanks for bulding this app but can you add this feature Feature-Enyone come online can see it not going to his or her chat like gb whatsapp Also gb whatsapp cool beause of that feature and can see the delete for everyone massages Can you add these features then whatsapp is become grate one Please add.🥺😎"
"I want to set my dp , but all my recent pics are not showing ,and if i want to share something with my friends, i need to go to my gallery select them and then share What is happening to WhatsApp"
"I absolutely love this app. But the one problem, and the incredibly large elephant in the room, is the fact that I originally signed up with WhatsApp through a home phone which was later disconnected, and when I tried to retrieve an accidentally deleted text chain with an important friend, I could not get back into the app without that phone number. Regardless of the fact that I was using it for 5 years. Now all the chats are sadly gone even though they were backed up. This is very disappointing"
"I'm satisfied, but one thing bothers me... which is, there is no emote for psychology......i would like it, if the emote would be there in next update...do the needful It'll be great, if WhatsApp can add new emotes in it's keyboard related to psychology ex. ""Psi - Ψ "" & many more related to mental health & profession in the next update...."
My status is not being shown to some of my contacts as well as my contacts are not visible to me and they are unsaved ! Even I have my all contacts saved in my Gmails
Please revert back / modify you algorithm to transfer or upload any image quality to better resolution it seems to be looking like we live in a way back 90's
"Finally got the ""Message Yourself"" feature 👏. Many more may come in future however, I'm dearly missing the one ""Schedule a message/response"" feature!"
"I,ve seen a BUG here in WHATSAPP! For some reason when you block a contract, the contract which was blocked can see our our ABOUT section, its not supposed to be that way, or is it?"
"Please remove the feature where you tap on a contact's profile picture to view their status, I mean you can literally just swipe once and be able to view their status."
The app is perfectly fine and easy to use but the new policy changes will make a great change in th no. Of users whatsap presently having and the new policy change is hard to accept for many. I dont like anyone handling my data for their convenience and business needs.
"I don't know why, after i updated the newest version i can't get call while using bluetooth headset and i can't play video in other apps because the ""audio use by other app"" plese kindly check this bug thanks"
"I older version is much more better .... The dp converting into status doesn't seem a great feature. Please take an survey of it , if people like it or not , coz for me i love the old version.. Thank you Whtsapp team"
"Hello. When searching for contacts, it's taking toooo long. What could be the issue. My storage is at 50%"
Too much bad experience about the audio call. Too much surrounded noise. Everytime I got headache after attend a call. Please fixed it soon. Can't tolerate. Otherwise I have to uninstall this app.
QR scanner for WhatsApp web does not work properly. It's really annoying. My phone camera is not the reason. I use Google pay to scan QR for payments. It works completely fine. Only on WhatsApp web this is happening. Please look into the matter.
"For some reason, the quality of status updates and shared videos and images is extremely pooooorrrrr.... Advancements are made and there is a need to improve this feature"
"My notifications aren't showing ever since the last update which has made me miss some very important messages, I hope this gets fixed soon"
"I love whatsapp, never fails me. However can you please make it so we can change the theme/colour. Yes there is dark and light mode but I need more, need to change the bubble colour and shape... pplllleaase tell me its on the cards"
"Good, but after recent updates, I can't see my camera pics and screen shots in the picture attachment, all I see is media shared on whatsapp, why??"
I've been using WhatsApp for 9 years now and it's a very reliable app. Accept for the fact that I couldn't sent videos/audios and other media at some times. One very important things is that The home screen needs a Groups tab on it. Not just a Tab for chats that group all the different types of chats together. For me that's kinda annoying.
It is a good app but the New updated version is annoying and sometimes frustrating 😤 viewing of status is even the worse because while viewing status it begins to skip on its own and I can't stop it. Secondly while recording a voice message it freezes while trying to tap the send button it automatically closes and takes me back to my home screen and it will have to take few minutes to open the app again. It's annoying
It's great but currently facing one issue. While uploading status on WhatsApp phots & video quality get low. If possible could you please help me
"The app is working fine but suddenly today my WhatsApp does not send any messages and even calls are not taken place and my data is completely normal other apps like youtube and insta are working but WhatsApp does not working. I am very disappointed i even restart my phone but it doesn't work ☹️today at 25th October 2022 WhatsApp suddenly stop working, please solve my problem"
I added what's app to a new device with the same contacts and it says I have no contacts on what's app.. I switched back to my old phone my contacts come up Anyone help..
Can no longer select media in my gallery since an update I have to go to my gallery and share via what's app this is becoming long... Fix this bug ASAP!!
"It's a great app works well simple to use 5 billion people have downloaded it, asnd there's 7.998 billion people on this planet 😲there's a snapple fun fact for you. Back up and restore messages is the one problem I have with this app. No real options except archive or not."
"Why can I no longer multiselect images on samsung gallery? This new update is dumb and irritating, I like samsung gallery's organisation and not how the whatsapp gallery organises my albums."
plz whatsapp developer give the feature of locking conversation individually... although the rest of it is very good to use but plz give the option too... i think it's the really need... for more private chats have to lock individually.. I just give it three stars ... when you give that feature I'll give complete five stars..
The voice message is lousy and unable to adjust the sound. The voice is so damn loud and harm my ear. The voice message just expose to public when input near to my ear and NOT PRIVACY at all. How come this issue still happens and not improving?
"I have been using WhatsApp for almost seven years now, it is a nice App, simple to use and easier means of communication."
hey whatsapp ! new version is good enough but i want you to prepare more better like telegrams do. something like pinned chat in a group message. its easy to tell anyone else. i hope you read this message thankyou ^^
Why WhatsApp still doesn't have a feature to edit sent messages. I mean there are more positive response to it than negative why not do it!?
"Had a chat on my Mobile version of whatsapp, next day when whatsapp gets opened in my laptop, jt just feels out of hands. Bombarded with all the old Messages that keeps coming no matter how many times I reopen the desktop version of whatsapp. Made worst after the update. Just bring the old one back, it was worth it"
After latest update my sticker packs keeps refreshing and they do not load. Before that they just need to be load one time in every chat; they would be there unless you go back (leave the chat) to chat list. And it was acceptable. But now they are useless.
"Missed some group call thanks to the 'silent' group call notification and for some reason, it's easier to mistakenly forward a message due to 'frequently contacted' and 'recent chats' list on forward page being different than the actual list on chats, althouh, it could be avoided if you're not following your muscle memory and actually put some times to double check 😑 But at least, thay let us have the apl running on both pc and mobile simultaneously as a standalone app."
After the recent update I can't open any display pictures of the members in group. It should be rectified rather than that everything is good
The app crashes whenever i do video and voice calls. It would not detect the bluetooth device or gets confused to route voice either by phone or headset. This is after Android 13 upgrade in S21
"It would be better if user can customize personal ringtone (voice notification) for every incoming message with the name of the person name from whatsapp contact, example: New whatsapp message from John or if it cames from group whatsapp would be sound like this ""New message from group whatsapp"" etc. So we can manage priority to see the message especially if we in driving mode."
"there is an annoying issue, when I open any message the keyboard opens automatically and scrolls up so I can not see the new message and I have to close the keyboard then scroll down to see the new message this happens with me all the time."
It won't play my videos on the app. It get blank whenever I want to post a video on my status or when I want to watch a video on d app
"Hello, just one thing. Please, like Telegram, when the WhatsApp cache is cleared, we can download videos, files and photos again. It's too bad that it can't be downloaded again, and the information archive is not available. WhatsApp's biggest problem Thankful"
Suggestion: Please turn off screenshot mode for whatsapp. Moreover sometimes it becomes possible to take screenshot of some apps just by opening window mode where an app can be closed instead of running in background. Please add blur mode in WhatsApp while window mode.
"Its such a terrible app as it needs my phone's whole goddamn storage space just to be updated.. everytime i have to delete my files even other apps just to update this pathetic app. Also, it stops working if not updated like is this a jail rule?? Instagram works fine, updates easily with whatever storage space i have and doesn't forcefully demand update either...and interestingly both apps are from same company then why Whatsapp is such a disgusting app???"
The app is stable and overall it does what it should but only on the very basic level. Other messaging apps have ton of useful and better features.
Since when i was work as OFW i deside to use this app but sad to say because i can't take videocall or calling through the person who I'm calling..so hopefully you can fix this or else any can sugest to fix this.thank you so much
I can no longer send photos on whatsapp from my gallery! It only shows a few albums of pictures people have sent me on whatsapp. Its super annoying. Please go back to how it was!
I don't know if it's the app or my device but I don't receive notification content or preview along with notification....it was good when I used to see texts from notification bar.
"Pleas add some features like , Whatsapp beautiful theme change option, add more whatsapp chats wallpaper, add this feature that we will able to send a documents or pictures to ourselves, add a pin code or pattern security options also, not only finger prints, chat deleted recovery at least 30 days ,THANKS. I WILL ENSURE YOU THAT, THIS FEATURE GAVE YOU A MORE DOWNLOADERS 👍."
"In WhatsApp, you can find options to block someone if you feel their messages and communication disturbs you mentally. In case, if you are blocked by someone on your contact list then how to identify this activity."
Last 3 days i am facing spam problem. Actually i don't know which type of spam in my phone whichas my WhatsApp account has been blocked. I am trying to get restore. But again get block. My account is still block. Then what should i do whichas it can fix them.
"Good application but sometimes' hang continuous even with large memory. It is nice to use to chat with family and friends, thumb up👋"
What has happened to this App? It is constantly trying to update and you can't stop it. I've tried manually to stop it but it just continues. Plenty of storage space on my phone so don't understand why it keeps trying to update and failing??
"Start hating this app... The love I had, it has now worthless things like When you want to see someone's profile picture, and click on picture to open it you will reach to the status. And it doesn't matter whether you have seen the status or not, it'll open...😠"
"Nice experience. But it would be a nice thing to: 1. Have more pin chat. (3chat is so annoying) 2. Let there be a status tagging. (I mean if I should upload a friend birthday picture, let me able to tag them so that they can receive a notification in their chat about the tag) 3. Thought of the above suggestion."
"I love this app. One request please, Can you upgrade the ""Poll"" feature? There should be option to mark the right answer as the ""Telegram"" posseses. Also, there should be feature to prevent others to see the previous votes. So that they can choose by their own."
"not a big fan of the new status update. it feels like with each update whatsapp is turning more and more into instagram, and i don't see the point. there is a status section on whatsapp, why make it so you see their status when you try to view their profile photo? not my favorite update.."
"My whatsapp call is not working properly and I cant do a voice note anymore. It freezes and takea like a minute to release, records my message then just deletes it and doesnt send. Please fix this"
Please solve WhatsApp glitches. i can't able to share photos directly from WhatsApp to other. Its a huge disappointment for users with such issues.
Something happen to my Whatsapp unavke to restore back up and keep popping out with message saying internet connection issue. Unable to setup. Really not sute what to do as been using it for years.
The latest update messed up photo/video sharing. have to do a long process to attach photos and won't let you send video? Why ?!?
"I have problem to access my WhatsApp account. It shows the message 'This account is not to allowed to use whatsapp due to spam ' Kindly help to retrieve my account. If I try to get verification code the number i get only different phone number, not automatic verification made in my account. So take necessary action."
Disable mobile data not working on one plus Nord 2 . From previously update . Working fine for dasable wifi data use.
"I use a Samsung Galaxy A52 with an Android 12 version, but my WhatsApp pop-up notifications is not working. It's saying pop-up notifications are no longer available in my androids version. That's insane, I can't deal"
"Been trying to restore my messages from a different phone for the past hour and always missing a lot of messages and chats even though I've backed up several times. Now I'm locked out of whatsapp for logging in too many times on the same two devices cause I'm trying to figure out how to restore the whole thing... Way to go guys, way to go"
"I am having having a problem while using WhatsApp. I have been using it since years, this never happened before. When I open my app it shows the notification that app is not responding and a message that app needs to be reinstalled, it's not working. I have reinstalled the app several times yet nothing is happening."
"If I could put 0 stars as my rating, I would. I don't know if something happened within my phone or if the app updated itself without my knowledge but now it won't open. I've tried everything: forcing close, deleting cache, even uninstalling it. Now I cannot even complete the registration of my number. This is absurd. I use this app for work. I need its availability 24/7."
"any photos I receive through WhatsApp they are not saved in my gallery,I usually view them in WhatsApp only, what could be the problem and how can I fix it!!"
It is a best app of all but I want it to add an update for showing number of people that are online in a group and total no. On the thing where they show the names of the participants.....it will be a great update to be honest....rest it's fab and wonderful....best app just do keep this update in mind 😊✨👏
"When I'm receiving the call on Whatsapp, no answer button shows up. Only the phone rings. Really dissappointed by such experience"
"3 stars because I am not fully satisfied with the experience why cant we customize our emoji type, either to android, iPhone or the phones default emoji and why does picture quality reduce.. that's my major issue with this app... I take a nice picture, try to post and the posted picture turns out blurred or distorted please fix this And please add the feature that iPhone users have that we can crop a video when we want to post Using colors and stickers to cover certain things is inconveniencing."
Recently I'm seeing that Whatsapp is having a little glitch in its animation. It happens after you see a profile pic and then press the back button. And there's a great amount of buffering when you add animated stickers from 3rd party apps. Wishing whatsapp will fix this soon.
"this app takes up 70% of my screentime and I don't even regret it. it has connected me to distant people so well that there is no more distance between us. I have learned how to make money, friends and even academically through it. the speed is point on. everything is super. no complaints at all. y'all just keep doing what you're doing.💯🤍"
"The experience with Whatsapp is good..... But one of my beloved persons wants the feature of recording Whatsapp calls... So, kindly work on this."
I gave 4⭐s instead of 5 because the latest update has some bugs. 1) please include a screen share option in video calls. 2) What's the use of broadcast group? 3) status videos are automatically trimmed to 30 seconds forcing a say 1mimute video to upload 2times.
It sucks cuz i cant upload anything to my status no vids or fotos the only thing i can uplaod is fotos an videos that i take on the app ant hlthat some one elses send me i cant even send someone else fotos or videos ... Im very un happy and for that i give 1 star
"Calls connect until both parties try to greet one another, the app then says reconnecting and then drops the call. Or, the call will connect and when the parties greet one another the call is dropped, and neither party could hear the other. This happens everytime I contact a certain party from my contact's list who resides overseas. This is such a disappointing experience."
"After update unable to choose multiple photo to send out. Beside, need to manually select the camera gallery from top right button only able to choose photo from camera gallery."
After update .. when we calling ... Another person cannot hear our sound .. during using Bluetooth.. I update and factory reset my phone but still same problem
it used to be nice but now it's the worst it keep saying try again and it didn't want to send the code also it didn't give me the choice to use the email even tho i add this way
"You should be able to save contacts you get from Whatsapp, to Whatsapp and not to your phone's contact app. It clutters up the phone's contact app. Especially if you don't plan on using that contact on any other app/platform besides WhatsApp"
"I usually hide my status view but all of a sudden it started showing me how may people viewed my status, i've tried correcting it but the option isn't there anymore.............. I really love the way it was before please do something."
Can't send photos via gallery anymore. Ios update has more features but none show up here. Disappointed.
Everything was just awesome till the last update three days ago .Now I don't get call notifications on my home screen and I have to enter the app to see if there is any call or message . Kindly fix it in the next update which I hope comes soon.
It's not possible to block unknown numbers that are not in your contacts which makes you vulnerable to spam attacks and calls from spam centers.
the last update is bad. you can not send more than one photo and it is more difficult to find what you are looking for in the gallery
I am unable to watch the status of the people it automatically shuts down! Only 1/10 status can only views properly.
No add inside the app . A very nice app. But there are four problems only . So much hacking is done using WhatsApp as calls on WhatsApp can't be recorded. This is because so much spammers are inside the app . The second is during master reset or during phone change . All the data of the app get lost (deleted) even after backup. We can't add two accounts in a single phone in WhatsApp. And the last one is we can't log in this app into more than 1 device . These are the the main problem. Thanks
"App keeps crashing after latest update. Have reinstalled the app, lost my recent msgs and still keeps crashing"
Frustrating!! One day all of my chat history suddenly went missing after the app crashed and there's no way to restore it since the backup always done in the morning. I asked their customer service and the solution given isn't helping at all. Be careful when you use this for work purposes you need to be very cautious.
"I have a Samsung S21 FE 5g. It won't let me update. Did all the troubleshooting. Cleared cache. Restarted. Etc... eventually did the last tip, which was to uninstall. But I cannot reinstall. It will not let me. Now stuck without WhatsApp."
"I love this app, it makes it very easy to communicate and share files. However, it would be nice if it would be a bit more organized- have Groups tab separated from Chats."
A lot of bugs with the new update. Calls drop every minute. Both me and the other party have a very reliable internet connection.
"I refuse updating this app cos I see no meaningful feature in it yet, Instead of you people to enable ""in-app password lock"" plus edit sent message feature on the app to enable more privacy on the app like Telegram does you people are putting some useless feature that no one need cares about having it.😬"
I am syed faiyaz Ali and i use what's up I have very nice experiences they help me lot I have lots of friends and family Members and i use calling and Friends photos images and seen videos and news stories and movies very good for me it's very easy to see status and I can watch another people profile what they kept . And I can call my friends at the time more than 5 video calls .
"Very bad and strange... Though Notification is turned off, sound appears when someone calls..."
"Yesterday my chats, documents vanished and I am unable to retrieve/restore even though backup being done frequently. I have tried to uninstall and reinstall, still I am unable to restore the chats, very sad for the lost chats/documents etc."
Everything is good... EXCEPT the video call quality and VC range issue! There is no proper connection even if full range area.
"Hello! I'm an andriod user and I've realised for awhile now that we can no longer check for the number of messages sent and received by a particular chat / group which used to be available under the storage usage function in settings. I also can't enable pop-up notifications for certain chats since I'm using adriod 10 and above. Overall, I've had a pleasant experience with WhatsApp, I just wish that this two features would be added back in future updates! :)"
Awesome apps. I Have been using it for a while. Sometimes it got stucked for few second or maximum 1 minute but from my perspective it can't outweigh the convenience.
Cool app been using it for a long time before moving to gb....but this app literally wayyy better than gb😂 . The only issue is that the group chats and individual chats are together..... it'll bee cool if you could like separate them the way chats and status are separated so group chats should be.....this is why most people prefer gb WhatsApp to this one...so if you could separate both and add other cool features you'll surely get back people who left to gb😉
There are some good things in this app but I have a very bad experience with this app. Whenever i see people online and as soon as i message them suddenly they become offline. And there replies also arrive very late. Can you please fix this whatsapp.
"Overall its a best messaging app, no doubt about it. The only part missing in it is call recording. If it's done, this will get more than 100%."
You can share your location without knowing if there are any outside attackers on your personal info so please don't hesitate to secure the app more.
Wonderful and very helpful. It helped me get close to my peers and teachers and it was amazing. Super fast reply and very helpful all in all wonderful highly recommend
"Everyday it does backup yet when I change device due to lost my phone, all backup trace failed. I've checked in ALL google accounts ever had. Nothing. I lost so much of vital work items."
"Best app,for communication but some errors like delete for everyone option should be separate from delete for me because I usually mix up by touching delete for me instead of delete for everyone.Meta please do something"
I need an answer from you. That's what I want to say. Whatsapp has two different looks. One look for iPhone users and another look for android users. What I want to tell you is please make whatsapp look same in both devices. I don't want to say the iphone looks better. But in my case it looks better on iphone and I think everyone likes the same look on different devices.
The live location only updates when the person opens the chat. I don't want to believe that's what they were hoping for.
"I think it would be nice if you guys could add a feature that allows you to edit and correct mistakes in your messages, even after they've been sent."
"I have been noticing different bugs in status section, video making & uploading, some in chat functions are abnormally working after the latest updates. I hope you guys fix this very soon, I'll update my review after the fixation. Thank you"
Guys and whatsApp pls clear my issue by mistake I deleated a bunch uf apps from my phone and first I thought to download what's app and it's showin pending downloade but not there and when I come again when I come back to play store it shows pending please clear thos issue
All whatsapp features is very useful but missing songs with a photo on WhatsApp status please update as soon as possible.
"No internet working on this app . On all apps like YouTube my internet works smoothly but in case of WhatsApp my internet goes slow down.""""""* IT SHOULD NEED A UPDATE* """""""
Latest whatsapp update. My latest/recent photo no easily accessible. I does not show up first. I have to find it & it is not easy. Its easier just to open galery & share it from there.
"As more features come, so does further policies. Recently Whatsapp temporarily banned me due to spamming, which's understandable since I was sending stickers to friends. But since that day, I've been randomly getting 1 hour bans everyday this week, even when I'm not using Whatsapp. I keep reaching out to the support team on the issue, but they immediately keep forwarding a ""bot-like"" reply stating that I'm using an unauthorized app version. Yet, I'm here leaving a review under the official 1."
"The app works very well.but I'd really love if the developers could improve the way status updates are posted just on the videos specifically, like adding in a feature that would automatically cut a video into 30 second clips."
"Since past few days, the stickers I download and store in my whatsapp disappears after 2 days. I hope you solve this issue."
It's like WhatsApp will do everything it can to not listen to users suggestions. The communities tab doesn't make sense. I can only add groups I'm admin to but in the description it's a tab where I can manage all my groups? Here is a useful tab idea for the millionth time. A groups tab. Separate Tabs for private chats and groups.
"The app is ok .....but whenever I upload or send some high quality videos and photos..... It makes those things in very low quality.....if i can upload status on teligram, i would rather choose that instead of this"
"Can so much better. Voice calls & receiving calls go's difficult. Most of the time or very often it don't place the calls, same with receiving. Afterward get the notice that I have a miss call"
"In the next update make the groups appear separately like CHATS, STATUS, GROUPS and CALLS. As it becomes difficult to find the groups among the chats and it's really confusing. Please, look into this suggestion and make an update. Thank you"
"WhatsApp is the best App to used I give them 85% for proctenion of your any message that you sent to your family and friends and know body can see it except you and the person you are charging with, I am very impressive on whasApp services and is why am always you sing WhatsApp app to chat with my poeples may almighty God bless the owner of the app thanks for the good work you are doing, in fact you are doing well thanks again. The only problem that I have with this app is that I can forward mor"
"Very easy but, we have to handle carefully.so not discontinue over links. My status photowill change .give my original status photo.happy thank you Some messeges are also not found ,so set my whatapp asit is. Whatsapp change,so set up correctly No thanks 😂"
"Ok I don't know if its because of this recent update I did or what. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy A23 and each time I launch the app, it crashes. I emailed your support team and they said it has nothing to do with them and all this started after the recent update."
"The latest update has a big issue. When I try selecting or searching for any gif, the viewing area is minimized to view only 2 gifs at a time even if they dont fit that area. I have tried talking to the customer support they gave the reason that this was the ""intended functionality"". Now the customer support is not replying to my messages for escalating the matter which I believe could be resolved in the next update. Please train the suppprt agents to share issue and bugs with the developers."
"Recent update crashes the phone somehow. Everytime I make a video call, after 3 rings, when the phone has still not gone thru on the other side, my phone restarts!! Pls fix this!"
"There is a bug in camera. Here, I mostly use whatsApp camera. When I want to switch any frame after I capture image, it is not switching to any of the frame."
My experience is very bad because today when i open my whatsapp then i see there is no previous chats and massages anything.all my data has been whas out . There is nothing to see only group which was created before were showing when i try to contact whatsapp support they said delete and reinstall whatsapp. And then i take a backup which was just 6.3 mb even my whatsapp databes is more then 3.4 gb . Now i can't see my old massages and chats this can be a big loss for me. Please help me..
The new release has made text status pathetic. Highly unusable and pointless. The old system was better.
WhatsApp now a days is doing worst. I don't receive any message until I open it and also quick message notification isn't working msgs aren't sent without opening the app. WhatsApp should also remove the msg forwarding limit.
"Your latest update is terrible... not sure why you imposed that the personal video images on a video call to be on the down right corner, you can no longer see the person you are speaking to once you minimize the window!!"
"It show's ""there was a error on playing video ""everytime when watching friend's whatsapp status,for that reason and it could not update profile about which I wrote, I giving this app 1 star ratings, My earnestly request to fix that🙏🙏🙏.when you doing that then I will edit my ratings."
"App is now EXTREMELY dated (it's not 2009 anymore, Meta). Also, Bubbles don't work and that's just annoying."
It is the best messaging app all its features are good. But I want to say that in this one more feature needs to be added that is the message update. When we send the message if the message is the wrong type or like spell mistake So after this we can also update the message and correct it after sending. Add this feature maybe it's more improved functionality.
What's the problem with google drive backup it's always stuck in 96% and backup size increase when i retry 1st 789mb then 1.7gb in my 3rd attempt it's shows me 2.8gb.
The new update for not letting me screenshot view once photos is bad. I really hate that they did that. I would rather have them send notification for the other user than not allowing me at all..
This app has been very helpful and doesnot waste much data. I prefer to use it to send and to receive messages at a reduced cost.
The worest app 22k now .. unfortunately my app was uninstalled by kids...my chat back up was never coming...the 0 rating i will give you... My email id and my gdrive also added but no use ..it's not working
From last update backup and restore problems due to the issue... I lost all of my chats and data.... This is worst Day by day WhatsApp is getting worst Even single Star is not rateable
This is the best WhatsApp app I have ever use It fast You can send video music and whatsoever . I just have nothing to say about It's the best messaging app.🥰🥰😂😇
This app is literally amazing but sometimes when I wanna watch a video that my friends send me it literally does not work I have no problem s with my storage so I don't know why it does that I hope you guys can fix this problem because its really disturbing me pls pretty pls its the only thing that's making me not enjoy the app
"The new update is annoying. I want people to see when I've blocked them, now my profile picture still shows. Also when sending a picture now it doesn't just pull up your picture gallery from your phone."
I have problem connecting to whatsapp on my new phone Samsung S22 Ultra from my old Samsung Note 10. Also not able to transfer my chat history. Please advise.
"Everyone uses WhatsApp. But please improve these areas; where picture and video quality is reduced during posting/Sharing. For group chats, please being taken automatically to recent is very frustrating. Make it possible I can go back to where I stopped reading even if I leave the chat while having the option to get to recents quickly if I want. That way it's more convenient for everyone and you don't miss a chat."
"Everything is fine but there's a problem when I upload a video in my story, first 30 sec of the video is perfect but when i upload another part of the video next after that it will get messed. The sound comes first then the lip syn. I mean sound and video is not matching."
"I have a little bit problem! : we can type any message to a group or individual in WhatsApp but problem is that anyone can type messages and send it to anyone. If the sender (not the original owner of the given profile ) send some sensetive content or any bad images by mistake then it will be problematic to the owner of the given profile. So, you should develop a new feature in which we can lock a important group or chat. Can you please fullfill my wish to WhatsApp?"
Everything is good but please rearrange the delete for everyone and delete for me options as the older version . Please keep cancelling button in between. And pls add the option to upload high quality status too.
New update is not much good aswe cannot add multiple photos to status for WhatsApp itself. We have to open phone gallery to select photos and upload which is boring and time consuming. What we want is to upload photos to status directly from WhatsApp gallery.
Notifications stop being received constantly. On first install notifications are received on lock screen. After few days notifications stop being received and I have to go into the app itself to get the notifications. Have uninstalled and re-installed (Oct 22) and exactly same thing happened - worked fine initially then stopped. Have switched phone on and off = no difference. Phone is Samsung A53. Have been through all notification settings and all set correctly. Frustrating!
"Everytime I uploaded pictures/videos on my status, the quality seems to decrease...why😭😭 I'm currently updating it maybe that may solve my problem."
"Please improve the quality of photos, videos sent through the platform, if i want to send videos from an iPhone i generally used whatsapp but degrades the quality so much that it is clearly different from the original. I have to send a normal photo to another Android device as a file in order to retain the quality and this way it didn't have any preview. So please work on giving the option to send the photo, video in their original state/quality. Don't compress everything."
"It was working well. But due to recent updates, my WhatsApp crashes immediately after opening. Any solution for it?"
Improved experience with privacy. Feature to edit/correct already sent text messages (typos) would add the perfect finish to the current update.
"WhatsApp is so cool, it's cut above the rest. But I think the option of deleting a message and notifying the other end must be reconsidered. I don't have to explain why I deleted...I hope you will look into this conveniently"
I don't know what is happening but there is a huge delay in notifications and if someone is ringing me. The phone sometimes doesn't even ring. I have updated the app and and my phone but still having this issue.
New feature adds in thw whatsapp in which we hides our online status so kindly remove this feature. I delete my whatsapp because of this feature. Kindly remove this feature so I again download whatsapp
"The view once feature for images is not secure, one can easily take a screenshot. You should disallow this, like browsers do when you try to take a screenshot of a page opened in private mode."
ROLL BACK NOW Photo gallery no longer 1 touch available. Multiple photos no longer available. Ease of use no longer available. Why update what wasn't broken ??
It's so much easier than normal messaging and I don't even have to worry about costs of sending pictures or calls. I really love WhatsApp and now can no longer live without it!
"Good app (of course), but I want to suggest that you make an option for finding all my tags (ie. @bright) and if someone slides my message to respond to it, just like there's a separate place for all media, it will be helpful in a group with so many. Also, if there's an option to mark a message by the admins of a group, so people can know which is important, by just going to the ""marked messages"", still like the media."
"Truly a frustrating app if you need to restore backup. I wish restoring from backup wasn't tied to logging in, if you have issues restoring backup they require you to REINSTALL to rectify the issue BUT they also softlock the number of times you're allowed to log in. Which means if you dont restore it perfectly you need to uninstall and try again... I've been stuck in this vicious cycle for far far too long (weeks). Good when it works, absolutely infuriating when it doesn't work intuitively."
"This app needs a lot of work. I changed my sim card and I lost my contacts and chats. I don't know why they haven't corrected this issue since. Why is all this updates when your app is still the same as always, Worse."
"With the latest update, whatapp doesn't wanna open it keeps saying it has a bug and I should wait for the developers to fix it."
"Dear What's app, I'm unable to see status of my closed one's, I'm not happy with this. Steps already taken to solve but no any solution: 1. Updated my WhatsApp also of other members 2. Checked all privacy settings of mine and other user too 3. Checked all status privacy settings too in both the phones of both the users 4. Checked all the what's app settings in mine phone as well as other what's app account of closed one's. Need urgent and immediate solution on this."
