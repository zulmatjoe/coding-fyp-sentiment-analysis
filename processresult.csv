review,sentiment
with the new update i also lost the ability to send gallery photos from within the app as other users have said it took me a long time to figure out how to fix it the other problem i have had for years is when i am listening to a voice recording and something accidentally covers my phones light sensor my screen automatically goes black and the message stops playing it takes several steps to start the message again and there is no setting to fix it it drives me crazy,negative
i like this app most of my friend and family groups have just migrated to it because of the ease that voice notes and video chat provide that said i wish there was an option to limit the picture and video autodownload by individualgroup chat and not for the whole app i have some chats where i like keeping pics but others not so much so the fact that i have to go into my folders to manually delete is a bit annoying that is why i took away a star otherwise it is a pretty good app,positive
great when it decides to work half of my messages take all day to send out most of the time and out of nowhere every call i have ends up reconnecting and then getting dropped my video calls do not work anymore since the update it is become more difficult to communicate with people by just using this app,negative
loved it but within the past update or two i have been so frustrated with the light sensor changing the way the msgs can be heard i will try to listen and it keeps stopping no matter what i try seems so random i do not know why it works or does not work at any given time and now i am trying to listen to a msg on my headphones and it switches to speaker whenever i put the phone in my pocket i do not want to have to hold the phone to hear everything and even when i do it does not play sometimes,negative
on samsung devices there is been a new update that is come through and whatsapp images do not show the latest image that has been taken for example like a screenshot that you just took will not be available in the gallery unless you go through and click the three dots and then select the photo and even when you do that you can always select one photo at a time previously all photos would be available even ones that you just took please fix this so i can give you a fivestar review,negative
as others have stated this latest release makes sharing photos from the gallery very difficult you cannot send multiple photos at once any more and you cannot write captions anymore this problem cannot be resolved as it is to do with how whatsapp accesses media from your phone utter garbage this used to be a great app now it is practically useless,negative
it is a good app and it does the job but changing from one phone to another is a total nightmare and nobody seems to be able to explain how to do it the web instructions are confusing and wrong the independent websites are confusing and wrong and i just want to transfer everything including chats from an old phone and number to a new phone and number i feel like it would be easier to build a faster than light spaceship and i also feel like it is a lot harder than it absolutely has to be,negative
new update sucks  please revert photo sharing features to how it worked before now instead of seeing my photos to send i see photos i have already sent i do not want that also once i found the secret photo menu i can only select one photo at a time sux sux sux  i get it  you do not want us to use your storage do not care incentive us another way please fix photo sharing,negative
fingerprint lock not working i just got a new pixel  pro and when i switched phones the app is not maintaining the fingerprint lock setting it only works randomly sometimes i open the app it does not ask for a fingerprint and other times it does even though the setting is enabled i have deleted and redownloaded the app cleared the cache disabled and reenabled the setting again nothing has worked to make it prompt me every time for a fingerprint,negative
my earbuds tozo t do not work in calls at all anymore but work perfectly fine in every other app on my phone which is super annoying because my current phone does not have a headphone jack so i am stuck either being on calls with them on speaker or holding up my phone all the time additionally the new update makes sending photos a nightmare with all the additional clicks you have to go through only to be able to send one photo at a time ,negative
i would give more than  stars if i could reach someone to resolve issue whenever i attempt to attach photosvideo from gallery it wont allow me to select them of course i also have to select gallery from the  buttons on the right but regardless i cannot select and send this is very frustrating as i use this for work and used to be able to do this with captions for each pic now i have to attach write caption send and do it again from another app,negative
the notification feature was eliminated from the android version iphone still has this feature this is why i give them  star i wish i could give it  stars instead of improving it they made it worse terrible sound quality the sound cuts in and out often to the point where you just hangup,negative
was good but the latest update does not allow you to select multiple pictures to send you have to send one at a time it now also requires multiple steps to get to your album just to be able to share pics so you have to go through multiple steps to get to your gallery which was not intuitive after years of using it and you can only select  pic at a time,negative
cannot give this app more than a  it is definitely meant for transitory experiences and not keeping things longer term you can export but not import chat histories restore from local database does not work no way to keep messages if you somehow end up with them on multiple phones from say using a new number without merging accounts immediately sad situation for ppl who like memories i would recommend telegram or some other messaging app,positive
since the last update like everyone else mentioned i cannot send photos directly from the app it takes forever for the photos to actually show up when i try to find it thru the app no matter if it is a photo i just took or a screen capture also when i try to change my whatsapp wallpaper it limits the folder that i can choose from so not quite exactly all of my photos not even when i screenshot it and hoping it would show up as my photos nope,negative
image attachments have stopped working you can no longer type a message and insert an image it has to be two separate messages it also opens up a different gallery view to the normal one meaning that you can only see the images already in what is app i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it is still not working please can this be resolved asap ok i have looked into this and there is an app called telegram it solves all of the problems above,negative
the worst app i have ever used chat backup works terrible and there seems not to be any intention to improve it the process to add stickers is archaic incredible that in  it does not have a function to send a message at a specific time or even to play a voice message with the screen turned off not even a thing is good in this app the best word to describe it is disaster,negative
sending images is such a hassle after the update now when you want to attach an image you can only view images that you have received on whatsapp you have to take extra steps to browse through your gallery to send an image from your gallery as an attachment which is okay but you cannot select multiple images i cannot imagine why you have done this it is unbelievably frustrating,negative
it is one of the best app for free messaging video and voice calls it also have group and community features which are also best for sending messages to many people at same time although the calling function does not works at saudi arabia so if the developer can fix it it would be great as well as there is no the ads moreover we can change theme chat wallpaper and the new avatar feature is also great,positive
after the latest update i am having problem while viewing videos the volume control does not stay fixed it keeps coming to zero while viewing the videos the same thing happens during video calls often the volume control panel remains on the left side of the screen this is a terrible situation as i do not know how to remove the latest update please rectify the problem speedily through another update thanks,negative
i am having a problem with optimisation and syncing messages notifications reaches hours and hours later yesterday evenings messages notifications arrived today morning until the last few days i had not seen a problem like this before receiving messages and their notifications is a basic function of a messaging app and it should be if this will not happen in whatsapp then why would i use it please solve this problem because it is quite frustrating disrupting and annoying,negative
love this app lately tho it has become very unstable notifications not coming thru the way they used to the delivery ticks are not turning blue when other party has read the message this is only sporadic not constant but stillcan something be done this has started just a few months ago before the most recent playstore update which did not fix the instability,negative
had a great experience so far  however after the recent update  whattsapp calls are taking way too long to connect  both incoming and outgoing  have not checked on video calls though  messaging is working pretty fine  also while trying to attach a image from within the chat window  especially which has been taken as a screenshot   it is not able to locate the image have to go to the gallery and use the share option on the image i am using a oneplus  pro,positive
since the last update the app does not allow you to send multiple photos you have to send them one at a time which is frustrating and on top of that you no longer have access to your camera gallery you have to go through multiple stupid annoying steps to try to find the camera pictures to send  by  this app has changed for the worse it is now useless and garbage very disappointing,negative
the app used to be great now they have changed the way the app orders it is messages ie if you delete messages from a conversion the conversation still stays at the top of the list where it used to fall back down the list to the relevant date order of the last message this is really frustrating would be good to revert it to his out used to be or give users the option in settings,negative
not entirely sure what they have done in the most recent update but i now cannot select a picture from my standard photo gallery without digging into the three dot menu also when sending a picture i write text to describe it and that vanishes and only the picture gets sent and i then have to retype the message clearly no quality control going on,negative
terrible update user experience sucks i am a very early user of this app and have seen it change and grow over the years but the most recent update has removed all the functionality that make it better than your standard sms as others have mentioned sending photos now is a tedious process of multiple screens and menus also pictures sent through this app no longer appear in the phones gallery anywhere the old whatsapp folders for images and videos no longer populate absolute garbage,negative
no longer able to select more than one image to send in one go have to select one send then go back digging for the photos folder to select anotherthis is another frustrating bit photos folder is no longer set up as default you have to search it through three dots at the top i choose facebook messenger more often for these reasons  i think i will delete the app if this does not get sorted,negative
i have always loved whatsapp number  app for fast clear communication the internet is not always the best on calls but it has improved immensely over the years if i was to add a suggestion though i think it would be awesome to have display pictures that loop and also its really annoying having to keep adjusting photos to fit into the box  when it does the image comes out blurry please fix so we can upload photos with larger size dimensions i hope someone gets to see this as its a good idea,positive
after the recent update i am not able to view the photos which are set to view only once in addition to that i am not able to backup my chats to google drive it always stops at  even though there is enough space on my drive the customer support just sends automated messages and is of no help really disappointed with the customer support,negative
brilliant use it every day and it works for me and all my friends there is a lot of privacy you have and even whatsapp cannot read the messages you send if you want more privacy on chats and etc you can definitely change the settings easily whatsapp is good at sending photos and unlike snapchat the messages and photos you send do not dissappear so you can go back and read or look at old things i think it really is a great messaging app there are also no ads,positive
the app has improved a lot but the backup is very messy takes up the entire bandwidth for the backup and wifi is pretty much unusable for anything else when the backup is uploading would not have minded if a specific time could be selected to do the upload we cannot select a time for the backup to upload the backup would be created during inactive hours but will not get uploaded until i wake up and try to use the phone then wifi is unusable every morning after waking up frustrating at times,negative
what have you done in the last update i can no longer have samsung gallery as the default gallery i have to go through multiple menus to get to the gallery then i can only select one image at a time if i write text then go to attach an image then all my text dissapears this is very frustrating tried uninstalling and reinstalling whatsapp all permissions allowed samsung s ultra latest software all updates can you please fix this,negative
it is a great chatting apptexting app however i hate the fact that photos are saved automatically to the gallery on my phone please just keep photos and videos that are sent back and fourth to each chat just in the chat and not saved anywhere else these extra memesphotos i have on my gallery are making the memory on my phone become extremely full and it is unnecessary a literal waste of space thank you,negative
seems like im experiencing the same issue as others i used to be able to send multiple images directly from the paper clip option but like others i now have to click the  dots then select gallery to then only be able to select one image at a time then repeat the process if i want to send multiple images which is not great user experience at all genuinely for the first time looking up other messaging platforms as this is just ridiculous nd jan   what is going on whatsapp,negative
restoration of the backup process is full of glitches which can easily cause you to lose access to all your backed up chats media etc customer care is non existent when it comes to any solving issues automated messages are the most you can get out of them for such a widely used app this is extremely frustrating and disappointing,negative
hi i am gonna get into it real quick i kinda find the app has lost one practical option i cannot send pictures that belong to my cameras album directely from the app now i have to go to gallery and choose pictures to send which is not fast and practical as it was before i hope we can get that option back thank you in advance,positive
the basic messaging app is perfect the need to be seen always evolving it adds complexity especially to more vulnerable users reacted to feature should at least come up as a notification otherwise the recipient never knows they got a response show once image option for a few sending explicit images adds complexity for all data cleanup should be better including the ability to delete all the media i have sent for each contact as by definition i already have this media stored on my device,positive
this app is terrible firstly i cannot send long videos to my contacts especially when it is something important it only takes half of my video and sends it to the contact and i cannot download a video that is long like seriously what if its something important i need to see secondly when i send a message it takes a very long time before it goes it also takes a very long time before i receive messages i also have a lot of issues to talk about but i cannot cuz the limits  words stupid app,negative
believe me this application is wonderful regarding communication send message at anytime of the day it will reach the addressee at any time and place across the country and continent is this not marvelous it is better than currier it also applied to photos black or colored it carries season greetings we use the application to talk to one another voice or looking at one another it is used to capture and send it to other people the list is long,positive
quick access to phone gallery not working anymore it requires more clicks and you cannot select several pictures at once whoever is responsible for user experience has messed up real bad quick access only to media within whatsapp is ridiculous and shows complete disregard for user experience what a huge step back on usability disgraceful,negative
i use whatsapp as my primary messagingphoto sharing app but since the last update i am considering not using it at all any more the new media picker is beyond poor and has broken a functional design i cannot send photos from my screenshots or camera roll without several taps i do not understand the logic behind this i am also having to resort to going to my gallery to select more than one photo from my screenshots or camera roll please roll back,negative
it is a convenience communication tool that continues to improve it is services though it would be great if it was like before in the aspect that it did not take hours to resend sms for verification it would be very very very useful if there was a hide chat feature to keep your selected chat from unwanted eyes going on the app,positive
can no longer bulk send images since update if i click on attachments the folders shown do not access the phones gallery click on more and select gallery but will only allow to send one if i click on the  to add more i have to select via the same route but it overides the one i previously selected and does not allow to select multiple makes sending pictures in bulk when i need to do so frequently rather difficult and long winded,negative
everything about the app is good however after the update text status have been messed up the text doesnt enlarge according to the amount of text on screen the number of words that are typable have also been reduced and it does not warn you when the number has been exceeded when typing why the downgrade,negative
awful last few updates i am used to tapping the paper clip icon which opened my gallery app and i was the able to select multiple pictures now after tapping the paper clip icon i can only select pictures and videos already sent or received previously in whatsapp i can get to my gallery app but via the  dots at the top right but i can only select  picture at a time please fix this bug thanks,negative
i really love this app i use it to text all of my friends and it makes it easier to identify that i have their correct number because of the profile picture although the call quality is really poor also on video calls i would like it to show nothing when i turn my camera off instead of just a blurry screen maybe you could show it as a blank background with my pfpprofile picture on it what i meant by poor quality is that i can barely hear my friends the audio becomes glitchy,negative
i would not recommend whatsapp to be used for businesses however it is very helpful for individual usage it delivers quick timely functional and consistent communication between any two individuals over half decent wifi it has its kinks to it like kicking you off once you start running low on storage or automatically downloading the photos of friends when you forgot to unselect that option but over all it is a great program to use,positive
one app that has seen a tremendous jump in its users as well as public interest in the last decade all in one from sending photos to documents to anything you need it is like a full on power package and a reliable application with security and privacy love the way whatsapp team is continuously working to bring great updates and features the layout and user interface and every feature is improving with time and hoping for more in the near future we expect a lot now from this amazing,positive
it is good app but still i have a suggestion to implement as below if anyone uses the onetime view for images videos or text then screen recording or taking screen shots should be disabled so that this feature makes sense i hope you will consider these suggestions and improve the services as soon as possible,positive
latest update forces the whatsapp gallery when wanting to send a file you have to now go through extra steps to get to the devices storage no setting to allow the end user to choose what the default should be obviously no one really thought that out piss poor but then again that is how facebook programmers are  they do not think,negative
 constant backup issues now i have to use two copies of the app  the app for mac wants to update but it does not for some reason and does not open either so i use a web version instead  cannot make a voice call quiet enougheven in the quietest mode it is too loud so that people in the same car can hear everything there is no issue with that in other messengers  and of course timeless classicsno way to use it on the laptop unless your phone has an active internet connection,negative
latest update was not good the app does not recognize phones media and instead only shows its own which is useless when it comes to send recent pictures from phones camera also because it needs several steps now just to send a recent pictureimage from phones gallery it can only send one at a time which is tiring as hell and finally it cannot send videos from the phones gallery since the app only recognize pictures fix this garbage this update is really inconvenient and pointless,negative
update needs to be fixed i am not sure if it is whatsapp or samsung but now all of a sudden you cannot upload pictures straight from your gallery and instead it gives you a list of media from your whatsapp chats which is near on useless you can share pictures from your actual gallery if you go on more options but then it limits you to just one picture at a time i am not sure who tested this but it is a mess how do you go back to a previous version of the app,negative
it is a really great app makes communication easier and fast you make calls to both local and international it is really awesome but it would have been super great if it could have a feature where you met your messages where left them just like in telegram,positive
used to be great not anymore whatsapp does not recognize phones media after the latest android upgrade this creates a major inconvenience when it comes to sending files in addition phone calls disconnect after a few minutes blaming the phones microphone and on top of that their customer support is the worst i have seen in a long time so slow and useless such a big disappointment,negative
it is good app but still i have a suggestion to implement videos or text then screen as below if anyone uses the onetime view for images recording or taking screen shots should be disabled so that this feature makes sense i hope you and improve the services as soon as possible will consider these suggestions,positive
why i cannot take a clearly picture easily it always blur  last time is good  now so lousy  even though i use flash  it take a long time to come out the pictures  please improve it  i suggest you make a button cotton for turn off the vibration after the photo is took  maybe that is the main problem  one more things is the voice notes message please do not auto put black screen for hearing the voice notes  it is very disturb for some phone that proximity sensor very sensitive,negative
i love this app it is very reliable in my opinion and it has good quality i do not know what i would do without it i just wish there would be more features with the status viewing where you can make different groups of people who can view your status and also that you can see who viewed your status when your read receipts are off i do however dislike the fact that we cannot screenshot  view photos anymore,positive
had a great experience so far however after the recent update  whattsapp calls are taking way too long to connect both incoming and outgoing have not checked on video calls though  messaging is working pretty fine  also while trying to attach a image from within the chat window especially which has been taken as a screenshot it is not able to locate the image have to go to the gallery and use the share option on the image i am using a oneplus  t,positive
all the features are good and all but the live location sharing is not working very well it does not update my location at all it just shows my first updated location and that is it idk why is this happening because my gps is turned on and the app is up to date i hope someone can fix this because i use this a lot and it happens all the time,negative
do not know why they make it worse and worse every update new way of choosing photos is awful i have to take several extra steps to get to a photo and today i took a video and it would not even show up in whatsapp so i had to open my google photos and share via whatsapp from there to send it not only that but i am having untold number of issues trying to call out to people using this,negative
since the last update the app does not allow you to send multiple pictures you have to send them one by one which is frustrating and on top of that you no longer have access to your camera gallery you have to go through multiple stupid annoying steps to try and find the pictures from your camera to send  by  this app has changed for the worst it is now useless and garbage so disappointing,negative
a couple of issues  when selecting photos to be sent it no longer shows the phones gallery folders by default very inconvenient to have to access it through the  dots on top left hand corner  unable to select multiple photos to be sent at once extremely inconvenient please look into it and fix them thanks,negative
on xiaomi mi a the app has  major problems  voice notes get sent empty after some random amount of time of app usage force stopping the app and restarting solves the issue but it is super annoying you be talking for minutes and boom the voice memo is silent  when scrolling up in the chat the chat glitches for a split of second and scolls itself up way higher than it should like i just wanted to see messages from yesterday but suddenly i am at the messages from  days ago,negative
it is good in general but has limitations like backup because we can only do it in our messages and contacts could have how to make backups mainly of stickers since it is deleted after formatting the own backup can sometimes stay in the loop and does not finish even though the internet be stable also we cannot search for a gif and emoji directly on the whatsapp this will be so practical and easy to send if it was added and when i search me to send anything for me does not appear myself,negative
my phone model is smjf there is a slight problem that needs to be fixed on the status tab when you scroll to the bottom it feels like the frame is dropping a lot so the screen is lagging and not as smooth as scrolling on chat tab hope this optimized asap thank you,negative
a simple and lightweight chat app you can send images with reduced size or original size as you like and almost any file with ease the main concerns are  somehow i cannot reply any status at all with newer versions the reply box and enter button is not shown by swiping up is it a bug on tablet devices  please increase maximum pinned chatsgroups  is not enough  somehow there are random business accounts those chatted me for unknown reasons and unrelated to me is it a bot spam,negative
experience is gud as far as it meets the basic requirements few more things can be added like a section where we can get to see a list of all the groups we are a part of in the app it is really annoying when i find some old groups made by our friends and now no one remembers that group we should have a list of all those groups so that either we can engage it or delete it easily without going to scroll till the bottom,positive
i use whatsapp everyday for the the past years the last update sucks cant select multiple photosvideos cant choose right away from gallery like before the first albums are whats app chat pictures i would like it to go back how sending picturevideo attachments were please not only me other users feel this way also please fix this issue,negative
keeps getting worse i cannot view onetime photos even though my whatsapp is fully uptodate even my system os is uptodate i tried uninstalling and reinstalling whatsapp to fix it but it ended up creating more problems  the restoring media has been stuck at  and it is doing absolutely nothing whatsapp developers  please help me and fix all the bugs,negative
whatsapp needs an update i cant send people images from my phone it only shows images from last week i have to screen shot each individual image and past it in the message to send its incredibly annoying and yes media visibility is on i have googled the issue extensively and havent seen any remedies for it yet please fix this,negative
i hope that whatsapp cancels the last seen feature because it is annoying to me on most modern devices some people are online now and the caller feature does not appear now and we do not know whether it is inside the program or outside it please take into account this matter and know that it is a special privacy others have it but it is annoying,positive
had a great experience so far however after the recent update while trying to attach a video captured photo or screenshot within the chat window it is not able to locate the videos or captured photos or screenshots have to go to the gallery and use the share option on the video or screenshot i am using samsung galaxy note  lite,positive
no ads easy to use well laid out receives messages and calls really well good quality reception on calls reliable end to end encryption good status function though not everyone uses it totally perfect the creators definitely know how to cater for peoples needs do not know what i would do without it if you do not have this app you are missing out,positive
since the latest update roughly a week ago i can only attach  picture at a time also when you go to attach a photo it does not automatically go to a view of your gallery you have to click a button in the top right select gallery select camera only then can you view the photos you took with your phone or screenshots the two most frequent things i send fix this right away please contemplating just using facebook messenger if this continues,negative
i use whatsapp on mobile web and desktop i am not sure where i can submit a product improvement requestsuggestion i just notice that we cannot resize the zoom level of the desktop app it would be aweosome if we can change the zoom level by pressing ctrl and  it would be great to have this feature thats similar to your other competitors i know this is possible with whatsapp web but i do not think it would hurt to have the same function on the desktop app,positive
why oh why they cannot set it so you can view gifs without them being saved to your phones gallery i want to see them but i do not want them to be saved i have turned off auto download but then you cannot view them at all unless you tap on the individual gifsnd then you have to delete it from your gallery very frustrating,negative
absolutely terrible messenger i cannot believe anyone actually uses it this thing drives me insane the design makes messages barely readable names are always unavailable backups are a joke notifications are messy there are no pinned messages no date searching there is just so much that is missing or is working badly it is like a curse because it is terrible but you cannot escape it because everybody is using this app for some reason,negative
whatsapp audiovideo calls take a lot of the to connect when on data pack when on wify connects easily and no it does not happen because of data not working properly as i can stream anything easily when on data so it is a software issue please fix it asap i use one plus t please fix the issue,positive
over the last few months this app has been the worst it is so annoying because i would use this app as my main source of communication with others however recently my messages just stop sending and videovoice calls are bad quality the app does not work and it looks like it is because of network issues but it is only that app that stops working,negative
it was really good i enjoyed contacts and media and texts with my relatives abroad and my girlfriend all with a nice snappy layout but then one day things got corrupted and i lose profiles and chats my backup files did no good deleting cache did not work and restarting was ineffective i had to reinstall this app and lose all preexisting data,positive
something has gone very wrong in the last update when attaching photos the camera album is no longer accessible only albums showing images from whatsapp chats are visible which is basically pointless the workaround is to click the three dots select gallery and then choose camera this workaround only lets you select one image at a time though and no video files are shown either it is a complete pain whatsapp devs ease unbreak this feature,negative
suggestions  restrict certain people from voice calling and video calling  add a ping feature or something similar to notify us when something is urgent  the ability to see if someone has quoted a message in their reply on the notification tray  the ability to react to messages from the notification tray thanks,positive
recently my android phone updated it is voicetotext feature the android text by microphone had been fairly accurate but suddenly became almost useless the whatsapp voicetotext has always been more precise than androids microphone feature but ever since android self destructed its microphone feature whatsapp is the only game in town i will rely on whatsapp for all my voicetotext work i am talking about serious work with important documents whatsapp is superior in voice to text work,negative
since the last update the chat do not organize according to the date of messages if one is to delete sone messages in a chat then the date of the last message is what it gets organized by since the update the messages are organized since the last time there is been communication with that individual even if you delete some unimportant messages the chat does not get reorganized please fix this the previous way helped a lot or at least give us the option to choose thank you for listening,positive
the app was working fine until the recent update when you call a person via bluetooth headset it connects your call to the receiver but the receiver cannot hear your voice but can hear you when then receiver calls you themselves also the quick message notification feature does not deliver texts properly with the sender not receiving the texts unless one opens the app please fix this issue as i think it is related due to some bug,negative

the new updates are bad and i do not like it if we delete any text from any contact it is not getting sorted with the last msg available in that chat when we try to look into profile pic it is opening status of that contact first which is horrible i am looking to revert the latest update kindly share the steps if we have that option the latest updates are disappointing,negative
poor ux between mobile and desktop versions upgrade broke many things desktop version archive or delete messages does not do the same in mobile apps every time i use the desktop apps i need to take a long time to sync new upgrade broke the photo attachment permissions for people looking for a solution go to settings apps whatsapps and allow permission for photos for crying out loud learn from telegram,negative
since you allowed use web whatsapp offline the experience got terrible before that the web whatsapp was fast and reliable now you start the page takes so long to carry on the messages when the tab closes it takes another eternity to reconnect it also often lost the connection and some messages apear on the phone and not appeared on page or viceversa,negative
recently annoying every day for last  days it is constantly trying to backup and failing at  i have tried turning backup off and it is still attempting it i have restarted my phone i have deleted some chats to reduce what it has to backup nothing works there is plenty of storage space i have just tried uninstalling and downloading the app again let us see if that works it didnt,negative
restoration of the backup process is full of glitches which can easily cause you to lose access to all your backed up chats media etc customer care is non existent when it comes to any solving issues automated messages are the most you can get out of them for such a widely used app this is extremely frustrating and disappointing,negative
it is a terrible app when you will have to switch from android to ios or vice verca you will understand what i mean it will be impossible to move chats across and you will have to pay  to some weird software for this telegram does not have such problem since it is cloud based secondly they limit account to  device when i have  phones that i use all the time on telegram you can add as many devices as you want,negative
facing issue in sending the media files from today no updates were made and i had latest version installed if i try to open the camera from whatsapp chat the screen freezes for sometime and get backs to chat if i try to send the file if i try to open gallery it takes few minutes and then gets back to chat storage available is around gb device one plus nord t android version ,negative
good app all messages can be sent and calls can be answered perfectly fine although i really wish for status they could add settings it would be much better if we could customize the fonts how big and small it is and so much more possibilities with each update the size of the fonts keep changing it was so good before small just to my liking but now its way too big i know for some people they would prefer big fonts but i would prefer small ones,positive
first of all app is awesome but need to update on status bar for example some one wants to upload a video message to on statusif heshe wants to share video which is more than minutes so heshe have to post for times second that is very annoying update on status barso we will post the video of more than  seconds in one time only that will be very helpful for all of us,positive
whatsapp started interfering with the keyboard and other screens when you minimize during a video call on the phone if you return to the screen none of the buttons work everything is up to date so please fix this bug as it is becoming a huge inconvenience,negative
good day whatsapp is an overall great app apart from a few minor issues after the recent update you can not view a profile picture anymore because it has a green circle around the picture and it takes you straight to the status that was posted by that person and also please can whatsapp make a separate tab to split the groups and individual chats completely because the tab for communities makes nothing different thank you,positive
the quality of pictures or videos when i posted on status or text is so bad extremely bad i hate it so much the videopicture was actually hd before i send it but the whatsapp quality ruined it from p to p real quick i cannot even see anything bc of the quality also why my voice note button is not functioning well  it has been months i have updates the apps so many times yet the voice note still cannot be used well  fix this,negative
nice app but unfortunately when i reinstalled the app due to a problem it was having all the photos downloaded from whatsapp to my phone gallery were erased over  photos and memories lost i didnt have it backed up but i thought if photos were saved to my phone that meant they were saved apparently whatsapp has the ability to erase photos from your phones photo gallery this seems like a massive oversight in the way the app works it should only be able to add photos to your phone,negative
when sending a message it does not show if it is delivered you need to back out of the convo and back in to see that double checkmark otherwise it will remain with  checkmark very annoying because you do not know if your message sent through or not if it is a connection issue or a bug very frustrating s fe,negative
photo attachment function broken as per other users comments in android v on a samsung photo attachment is now a complete naus you can only select photos sent or received within whatsapp in the preliminary folder view to attach a picture you have taken on camera you have to click three dots and go through a secondary picture or gallery app and then you can only select one picture at a time ugh please fix this,negative
used to be very reliable but since fbmeta took over it is a buggy mess version upon version lately i have lots of problems with audio clips they are sometimes completely silent and after sending one the whole thing bugs out and no further clips are sent you are just there talking to yourself the whole time furthermore opening the camera for inchat pics or status updates locks the phone up until the app crashes we do not need more features we need the current feature set fail and foolproof,negative
before the update whatsapp was amazing now when i go to send pictures i cant it only shows the pictures that i received from other whatsapp chats i then discovered that if i touch the  dots on the top right corner i can open my gallery but i can only send one picture at a time and all of my videos are missing i have to go to my gallery app to select a video and send it one at a time please fix,negative
still much space needed that one has to dedicate all storage space in the phone and the forceful upgrade of the app is very annoying even when one is not ready to upgrade so frustrating one should upgrade when one is ready to create the space imagine mb for this app upgrade a very convenient and handy app great in all ramification except in data and storage consumption awesome indeed very useful and almost indispensible and so easy to use consider blocking group than exiting,positive
been using for years i have just got a new phone and cannot have popup notifications on my lock screen  this is seemingly unavailable for android  and newer which is crazy why would it go backwards with a newer version it is a real flaw especially as my notifications are always on silent and i usually just glance at my lock screen to check everything else still has popups so whatsapp is the only one  come on it folk get your act together pretty please ,negative
would be good if you could add location to picsvideos shared on status and have live video sharing on status also why does it have to have contacts to invite under your list of contacts very annoying if you want to quickly scroll to the end of your contacts to now have all these random numbers that you would never invite some are just short codes listed not even proper numbers very annoying and messy looking,negative
i keep missing video chats because the phone does not ring it is been happening for over a month now used to think that it had something to do with my phone but the persons phone i am calling also did not ring only notification shows up edit lately video chats are impossible because of the noise everytime i say something this terrible noise appears it is so bad that it makes video chat impossible so we switched to another app please fix this noise,negative
its a pretty good app i like the updates alot the voice note speeding feature is my favorite there is one feature id prefer to see as a new update is an audio recording feature on calls as i am a studeny i tend to take explanatory lectures on whatsapp it would really help if i could record the audio i hope you would take it into consideration thankyou,positive
i am having a great experience with this app and this app is improving a lot but the function linked devices is so much trouble when you are using this function it is all right but what if someone use to hack your messages please introduce a feature for the linked devices function like a lock and password,positive
this version of whatsapp if so messed up i could send voice messages through whatsapp before but now that option is corrupted cause of the new updates this meta version does not let me send any voice message if i record and send every time it shows only  second record even if its a  second recording this has bothered me for a whole year i need solution on how to fix this problem as i have tried everyway possible to fix it with the new update but nothing works please fix this problem,negative
cannot screenshot view once media anymore this is really silly as my friends use view once to send things without using storage on our devices since whatsapps saves everything locally so if the receiver wants to save it they just screenshot it how about just giving the sender a warning that it was screenshotted big tech needs to stop forcing us to do what they think is right for us if you send things online then assume that they will be saved take responsibility for your actions,negative
i am facing a problem in whatsapp relating to sound i am not able to hear voicenote sent by othersneither my voice record works it plays but there is no sound the sound of any videos or audios sent by others is inaudible if i play directly in whatsapp but the same videonor audios sound is clearly audible if played in other media apps i am not able to resolve the issue kindly note and help me with the same,negative
i am very disappointed to the customer service and the system the chat history has been backed up in the old phone but when the new phone is replaced it shows that the chat history cannot be restored and the machine crashes trying to log in again does not work either we have request the otp by phone call two twice first time we get otp but the system show us the otp code is incorrect second time we did not get otp via phone call until now we did not get any response from customer service,negative
used to be great not anymore whatsapp does not recognize phones media after the latest android upgrade this creates a major inconvenience when it comes to sending files in pddition phone calls disconnect after few minutes blaming the phones microphone and on top of that their customer support is the worst i have seen in a long time so slow and useless such a big disappointment,negative
very nice experience with whatsapp but i have a suggestion the option for scheduling messages for example if we have to wish someone on their birthday we may forget it on time if there is a feature of scheduling message we can send the message earlier and it will deliver on time as we selected earlier waiting for this update,positive
okay so it is a great app with great features but i am having a problem with the voice note feature normally when i pause a voicenote as i am recording it i should be able to listen to it before i send but recently after sending like  voicenotes i become unable to listen to them before sending until a few hours after please fix this thank you ,positive
major issue faced is after the recent update video calls automattically stops while talking especially while connected to a bluetooth device it shows the microphone have issue please restart your phone but after that also the same problem is detected it is very difficult to face a problem like these from this application and it is very uncomfortable for me to deal with these kind of bug hope these problems will be solved,negative
great app there is just sometimes some glietiches but overall great but i suggest that on status we can make them so only certain people can see so of i am making a surprise party i will make a status about it and put only the people that are going to be in it in it another one i think it would be fun to go live on watsapp the people on your chats can join and see i would also like that i can record videos without pushing the button all the time but instead you click on it to make a video,positive
as someone has already mentioned the latest update has messed around with the gallery whilst sending photos yes you can click the  dots in top right and find the main selection of photos but you cannot select more than one at a time now and making it a timely process seriously needs to go back to how it was please fix,negative
since the last update you cannot send videos at all it will not even bring up your videos as an option to send what so ever the gallery that pops up is what has already been sentreceived through whatsapp yes you can click the  dots to find your other photos but cannot send multiple at once you need to fix this awful update wanting to send short videos to family is now impossible,negative
great app indeed but would like to suggest to add some new features it would be amazing if there is an option to turn off online status so that when you are on whatsapp others cannot see it the option should be customizable for certain people just like the status option provides last seen option should also have the exact same facility happy chitchatting guys,positive
like others have mentioned ever since the latest samsung update i can no longer attach a photo from my camera gallery to a whatsapp message i can only access media that i have been sent on whatsapp my work around has been to attach a document and go to images but the photo attaches as a jpeg  not ideal as i can not see the image of what i have sent please fix this whatsapp,negative
one app that has seen a tremendous jump in its users as well as public interest in last decade all in one  from sending photos to documents to anything you need it is like a full on power package and a reliable application with security and privacy love the way  whatsapp team is continuously working to bring great updates and features the layout and user interface and every feature is improving with time and hoping for more in near future we expect a lot now from this amazing team,positive
inconvenient to attach pictures and videos it was super easy before this last update and i would have easily given it  stars but since i cannot easily link the photo galleries and folders i want to link i am only giving  stars until they fix it i will change this once the fix is made,negative
overall it is one of the best messaging app it is too smooth and gives best experience in conversation but  thing which it should have and will be very appreciating is autosplitting of complete video in parts while uploading status if it can upload a complete video in parts of sec than it will be very good as it will not break the continuity of the video,positive
i do not like the idea of opening status by clicking on profile please remove this feature to see the profile picture i have to open contact then click on namenumber then on profile and have to choose view photo  if any one want to see status they can go to status tab and check i do not know why you have implemented this feature to open status from profile picture,negative
good crossplatform alternative for messages some changes would be suggested though feature missing cannot be singed in on two phones at once unlike imessage also could better image and video quality shared biggest drawback does not use cloud storage telegram and discord have implemented it whatsapp eventually takes up  gb on my phone and only option is to delete messages,negative
always used whatsapp but it could use much more improvement or ideas for example all the updates you could have needed  years ago like pausing audios are only here now i hate the new updates with the avatar and not being able to screenshot or screenrecord only on one x pictures like a lot my girlfriend and friends hate it too,positive
local backup does not work at all lost all my chat history because there is no option to simply tell whatsapp where to find the backup file it should be found automatically but it dosent being a software developer i am pretty sure it is not my fault but never mind mostly switched to signal anyway due to other reasons like data security and so on,negative
the apps mostly fine my biggest issue is that when i want to upload a video that is longer than  seconds and i trim it let us say somewhere in the centre whatsapp does not save the trimmed part but instead sends the first  seconds as such i am always forced to use a video editor inshot and then forward to my whatsapp status from there finally please stop with butchering image and video quality at least make it an option instead of forcefully compressing size and quality it sucks,negative
what on earth is going on half of the notification settings have been removed and what is available does not work i turned the group notifications off yet still my phone has been blowing up since half  it is currently half  i used to be able to select who i can get notifications from specifically that option has also gone pls stop changing things that make the application redundant thanks,negative
previously when i used to delete a message from a chat whatsapp automatically use to resort the chat list according to date but now when i delete a message it does not change the chat list by date for example if someone messaged me last month and then again today if i delete todays message his chat will not move down to last month in fact it will remain on top of the list with last month datetime on the right does anyone know how to fix this issue,negative
it is been years for heavens sake please add an option to tag everyone in a single message for groups instead of having to add each name after  i do not think this small thing deserves the entire app to get just one star but i doubt it will get any attention unless i do so i love the app otherwise also do not know if this is the right place to mention but please bring back sticker packs on the web version the kind where you add sticker packs to the phone and it gets synced with the web,positive
something went wrong with your chat history this happens to me daily for monthes now daily it is such a bother the  am backup triggers this everyday plus sometimes it will also accure seemingly at random throughout the day worst thing is the restoration is not working properly and i have to guess when to force close it and hope to not lose days of my chat history many times i do lose several days and have to resort to reinstalling the app which causes of course the loss of settings,negative
oh dear it is not sending messages despite amazing internet connection it is generally a good app but rather than say memory too low it just removes some of my chat before i can back it up really upset  no reply from app also why is the video editor bit next to the back option stupid really as it loses the video if you go out by a millimetre,positive
great app but keeps getting a little worse with each update latest when you try to attach something from the gallery to a message it takes you to the whatsapp gallery and not your phone gallery extremely annoying change i use this feature all the time and they just added two extra stepsclicks to the procedure is there a way to reassign the gallery link hey whatsapp you know the whatsapp gallery is available in the phone gallery right,negative
what on earth is going on with this app it worked perfect until the last update now when i am trying to attach a photo from my phone it is only showing the photos between me and that specific contact if i want to attach a video it wont even appear at all if i want to attach multiple photos i actually have to go into my photos app and share from there to whatsapp like it is completely the opposite of user friendly right now,negative
cannot see or download pictures or videos keeps giving error message plus when pictures are sent they cannot be seen they are just blurred out the app crashes allot more since updates recently and now the call quality is worse than before sometimes can hardly use calls it just does not want to work this used to be such a good application but not just problematic sadly i really wishe these glitches would be fixed,negative
as much as i like and use this app daily i have one niggle when on a video call i have a z flip  and it automatically goes into split screen if i flip it up all other apps have the option to choose full or split screen when flipped i want it to stay in full screen mode,negative
ever since the last android update on my samsung gs voice and video calls have issues with the sound breaking up occasionally it drops the call completely complaining about a microphone fault there is nothing wrong with the mic i have cleared the cache but that made no difference app is currently unusable for calls which is totally infuriating,negative
ridiculous after the latest update you can no longer attach multiple images at one go instead you are forced to repeat image selection by going through a tedious clicking spree backup is never successful and slows down your phone the microsoft whatsapp app is even worse i am moving my whole hospitals communication to telegram whatsapp has been a complete nightmare,negative
the app is good constantly improving and adding new features to it whatsapp may think to add a feature where a sender can send a message in an encrypted or in locked form which a receiver may unlock after a due date or on happening of certain event or after putting a password shared by the sender this feature will help the people to convey their feelings or emotions on real time basis which they do not want the receiver to know right now right away looking forward to it,positive
after the recent updates during a video call my speaker is making some strange noise and for the next seconds the members in the call cannot be able to hear anything it happens repeatedly many times in a single calllength of call  mins kindly take note of this and clear it at the earliest,negative
using galaxy s fe after updating it to android  the following issues are noticed  if i want to send image from gallery it does not shows the complete photos only few photos are available i need to go into phones gallery to send the photos  even after deleting contact it is still showing in whatsapp contact list tried deleting it multiple times but its still in whatsapp contacts list kindly sort it out,negative
hi head whatsapp is a very high and an easy means of communication through whatsapp people from all over the world are very close to each other but sometimes there is a problem that is the problem of speaking the language because one country is different from another country i do not understand the language easily there are many countries in it that the language is very strange such as china japan indonesia etc sir i suggest you to use all language voice translator call translator an,positive
data migration from one android to another is a nightmare you have to upload a lot of data to google cloud and only then download it to your new android device although you can locally backup the data there is no option to restore it from your local backup and it is not even a difficult thing to achieve,negative
usually works fine for chatting buy i hate that it is tied to a phone fully proprietary and somewhat crippled when not giving it the invasive permissions it requests such as contacts also transferring chat history to a new phone is an absolute nightmare does not work and restore only happens when reinstalling which has horrible timeouts for the verification code,negative
i have to say  i really hate the new update sending pictures in the gallery shows only stuff that i received or have from within whatsapp the  dot gallery doesnt show any of the most recent pictures or videos i took  this app os very inconvenient for work at the moment telegram does not to have this situation works always and i think we might switch to telegram  do you guys even test your own app or take any feedback ,negative
the app used to be great till the past few updates firstly stop auto trimming a video that has already been trimmed to be uploaded to status updates that is not the point of an option for trimming being available whenever i want to upload a video to my status update and i have trimmed the part i want do not want to be seen once uploaded it automatically trims the part is wants for instance i want secssecs to be seen in a one min vid it automatically trims it is own portion once uploaded,negative
terrible update that is ruined the app as others have said attaching photos from the camera roll now takes longer and you can only send one photo at a time cannot work out how to send a video which was easy before please fix asap,negative
update media permissions had been revoked by android  update working fine again lately it is just unusable cannot send videos or share anything as easily as i could the gallery only shows media i received unless i go to a sub menu which only displays photos no videos the main reason i use this app for,negative
i have not been able to sign in for  months now i get an error message every time it is glitching it takes me to the page where u put in your name immediately upon opening the app even after uninstalling and reinstalling good first experience but nowterrible,negative
i love the app i have used it for years however the app date is giving everyone issues when attaching photos or videos directly in the app i can share them to whatsapp from my photo gallery but not while in whatsapp we are waiting for the resolve not sure if this is linked to an operating system update or an app update,positive
no real point in using when you cannot see the other person online status as far as privacy is concerned disabling last seen and double ticks were enough atleast online feature would help in quick communication or knowing the message would be read soon after now it is just like ordinary messaging apps where the other person can easily deny they never got to see the message,positive
since the latest update  i can receive incoming calls but can no longer actually join them you get stuck on a screen saying connecting until the call drops images are not being sent in private messages you simply get stuck on the screen absolutely hate this new update please fix it,negative
i get trouble with voice recordingsalbeit someone sendingi recording onemy screen blacksout and refuses to allow the recording to go throughvideovoice calls are always trouble either not recieving or not notifying me of an incoming callthere is many more to add to this listwallpaperspicturesstatusetcnormally one would thinks its the wifithe phone itself but all my other apps works finewifi is strongoverally greateven got my phone checked out and everything is finepls fix this,negative
you touching things you are not supposed to what i mean by that is you touched something that was not supposed to be broken but you broke it listening to a  minutes message then replying to it and then trying to resume it where you left off the message starts all over again and you cannot skip forward meaning you have to listen to  minutes of the same message to be able to finish the last  minutes really terrible,negative
agree with the previous reviewers that whatsapp is just dead now so many updates yet you cannot fix a simple galleryphotosharing options why was that tampered with in the first place now i cannot send video frm my gallery i have to go into the gallery and share the video via share option the app has discombobulated my gallery views from whatsapp directly you cannot select multiple pictures to share it is bad enough that the video quality picture quality you wish to share is reduced already,negative
after the last few updates it seems to have gone downhill pop up notifications are now removed and i have been trying for  days to either re enable them or at least tell me who exactly i get messages from besides you may have new messages saying pop up notifs are not available for your android when before it was possible and did it automatically please fix thisthe convenience of having messages be replied through the pop ups and notifications is helpful again pls fix this,negative
every update it gets worse uploading files photos and videos is so stupidly difficult now i have to go to gallery select stuff then share to whattsapp but if it is more than  items at once it will all deselect and i have to select and sort it again the features are trash and there is no invite system or rank heiarchy in groups you either have no permissions or every permission this app has fallen off big i recommend you leave this app and find a better messaging app,negative
i would not recommend whatsapp to be used for businesses however it is very helpful for individual usage it delivers quick timely like kicking you off once you start running low on storage or automatically downloading the photos of friends when you forgot to unselect that option but over all it is a great program to use,positive
unreliable backup and restore process was getting a great tradein the deal so i backed up everything on googledrive and brought a new phone highly disappointed as i was unable to restore the chats from google drive backup the process kept failing tried multiple recovery tools to extract chats from backup but no success,negative
great app feedback there should be a way to easily login to multiple accounts and easily switch accounts even it will be better for the web version to work on mobile device browsers this way it is undistinguished from sms where i need to check multiple devices then connect them to internet to collect or send information,negative
suggestions to improve ui  justify the content in the text box it is not very satisfying to see the text messages not properly alligned please justify the sentences inside the text box of both sender and reciever  and it would be better if the dark mode is darker black not grey  adding a smooth transition for chats rolling up and down for new messages would be better to use,positive
overall it is a good working app calls and video calls could lag a little less but it is not as bad as it used to be another option to log into whatsapp web must be added by developers as scanning qr code is not always an option you may not have your phone with you and that is most probably the reason why you need to use whatsapp web ,positive
really dissatisfied with this app it used to work great up to the last update now it does not let you use media from the gallery you cannot pick multiple photos or videos to send like before really bad for the work i do  need to be able to send multiple photos it is gone from  to ,negative
i am using android version  and my whatsapp does not show pop up notifications and the time and date messages were sent it also does not show the last seen even though i made my last seen to be shown to my contacts it only shows last seen at and no time will be shown what could be the problem,negative
great app but i would love it so much more if it did not default to opening in a message when i click through the app not a notification i intentionally leave messages unread until i have a response but if i want to check another convo the app automatically opens the one that is unread,negative
this new update definitely has some few pros but as a uiux design analyst i particularly feel the new camera position should be switched with the community label because that is not something a lot of people will get used to and there are a few bugs to be fixed in the messenger itself thank you ,positive
edit    the new update makes pics harder to send and whats with the volume i was a solid five stars  now  i use this app every day for business and family there are new features i have not tried or need a better explanation in their help section a secure connection is important to me they say it is it is my go to for international callstextsmessages,positive
great for the most part unfortunately it is always telling me it is either unable to backup or that it is trying to backup i backed it up this morning it is said preparing to back up ever since i cannot get rid of the message it stays on my notifications and it is super annoying,negative
the call quality could not be worse same issues with facebook and instagram calls  the background noise is more prominent than the person who speaks the speakers voice is partly cancelled it seem the opposite should be done  cancelling the background noise and optimising the speakers voice,negative
there are many problems with the last update i cannot play videos or audios when i am in a call i was able to dobit before the update and now popup notifications are no longer available in my version of android my phone is a galaxy s ultra i know it is not the last one but cmon is not even  years old hope you can fix it,negative
this update is annoying if you try to attach photos from the app it does not let you access the camera roll and has the weirdest way of organizing photos video and voice calls do not ring with a ring tone customized or otherwise please fix this,negative
awesome no ads and a big variety of contacts adding contacts is endless the app comes free with unlimited texting and status emojis stickers and bitmoji is free too the only thing is that when you click on a picture sometimes the word bar disappears and it is quite frustrating especially because of my autism,positive
the recent update is very badit is very difficult to connect as we are not getting calls and messages direct on the screen and not getting the notifications it becomes very difficult to all time open the app and check please change the update as soon as possible thankyou ,negative
used to be good but lately when i make a call or a video chat the person on the other end cannot hear me they said the call was breaking up meanwhile i am hearing them fine i have tried restarting the phone taking out and putting the sim back in and turning the phone completely off and nothing is working,negative
everything everyone said in these past few days  i cannot find the videos from my gallery to attach took me a while to find the pictures which is very inconvenient and now the videos i have to go to the gallery and share them very time consuming and not user friendly at all,negative
lately i have been starting to face an issue and i am a bit unsatisfied im not able to check if the person i am texting has seen my msgsthe blue ticks do not appearits been a few days since i updated the latest version and since then i have been facing this issue this issue really frustrates me out and i will be hoping that the management solves this issue and the ones others are facing after the latest update,negative
a very good app for quick and brief communications and to exchange pics docs or short videos but i started experiencing a new bug or something when a recent chat is deleted the contact is still showing on top which is beyond privacy is there anybody who can help me to fix this issue,positive
please hide the muted status and also hide the archived chats without that it is of no use whenever archived chats send a message it pops up which makes the feature useless and also the muted statuses appear on the screen and get clicked accidentally i want to give  stars but giving  instead so that it pops up in the section,negative
i like using whatsapp as it connects people from all spheres of world but from the past few days i have been experiencing issues in the appthe chats get restored but the present days msgs disappearand today without any notification when i just opened whatsapp all messages from every chat disappeared i tried backing up again but no avail please help me retrieve my messages back especially messages of my work groups thank you,negative
last update made it very inconvenient to send screenshots since the attach an image button does not take you to gallery and need to hit three dots to get there why would you even bother spending any time  resource changing something that works perfectly fine,negative
my sent messages quality is low and not clear while on messenger the quality is the best  so i cannot blame the phone mic or internet or phone quality sometimes calls are not making a sound though i have all sounds up or either i sometimes do not see the call ringing show up but then i get a notification about missed call after the caller stops calling,negative
im sorry but this new update is complete trash the new image layout is ridiculous used to able to select multiple pics at a time now have to do one at a time calls dont even come through unless i open the app and ive checked all the notifications seriously need to fix the issues here supposed to get better with updates not worse,negative
did not mind the app but with the new samsung updatethe gallery only shows whatsapp meda and photos before switching the over to the forlder in the  dot sub menu and i can no longer send multiple pictures at once you have to add and send them individually making it less userfriendly,negative
since the last update you cannot share images basically without having to select them in a round about way this needs an immediate fix or i am going to stop using it all together because the only reason i use it at all is for the ability to easily share images which now is next to impossible,negative
i request to the developers maximum people needs privacy for only few person  but we can not able to set any password or fingerprint for a particular person that is the worst thing i am facing i request to the developer to create a feature so that we can chat privately in tv ads they shows that privacy end to end but in real life every one wants privacy for few persons,positive
i do not know what is wrong but lately my incoming calls on whatsapp do not ring my settings are all checked and is correct it started about a month ago after i did a update can you please check if there might be a problem i have a huawei p smart phone i also cannot sent videos from my google account anymore said file not supported you need some issues to fix please as calls are impossible to hear at times that is now if it rings before last update this app was best but not anymore,negative

hey whatsapp creators great messeging app all things considered i have an issue with being able to share statuses there is an easy way to share statuses to facebook but the app cannot do the same through to instagram since these  apps are intergrating i feel that statuses should be easily shared once and for all to whatever platform i choose i should be able to share it to either facebook or instagram or both of i choose so here is a suggestion hopefully it is implemented,positive
it is a good app i have a suggestion though it would be nice if whatsapp could send messages or videos to a group of people or a selected amount at a specific time just like an alarm for example as long as there is data connection it would send i wish you a merry christmas at exactly  to contacts,positive
i love this app to keep up with my sister across the pond but all of a sudden i can no longer access my phone gallery to send pictures let alone multiple pictures or videos i am not the only one having this issue please fix this glitch and issue then it will go to  star if it helps i have the samsung galaxy z fold ,negative

please provide option to record the audio call other person is better not notified about recording also provide option to organise multiple chats of similar type to be together for personalization eg in a combo or a label i can put my colleagues another combo can be of friends and another one for family etc a contact can be in multiple combo also right now i am able to create  such combo using archive feature so a particular type of chats are there but i need more combos,positive

some album in gallery is not showing when i want to upload the videos or pictures to status or personal message pls rectify this issue for an android user like me whenever i want to upload status the quality is sucks pls rectify this problem even though the quality we take using our pictures is in high quality,negative
it is great app but i think makers should give us several sections for groups and simple chats it would look more satisfying although app is great  but i think some features like instagram like status and seperate section for groups both would make it more cool and handy for use if this is there i will definitely rate it  stars,positive
seriously meta take note of what we are saying it is now impossible to attach an image to a message without going through a ridiculous convoluted process and you can only attach  image per message  the iphone version is still the same and this is how we want it sort it out,negative
after the latest update i seems to be cannot one shot select as many photos to sent my other person and ended up always had to sent one by one photos to others and that is really very inconvenience to me please downgrade the previous version thanks,negative
why i cannot send latest picture from my gallery through the app itself i have to go to my gallery to do that i found it very inconvenience and wasting my time i do not know how to fix it and i hate this i cannot reinstall my whatsapp either or others picture that being send before will be missing i hope you can take this issue seriously and fix it accordingly i have been using this app for years please do not dissappoint me,negative

what happened to the app it is ridiculously difficult to add pics and vids now you still can but it does not seem to recognize your media any more to add a video you have to share to the app from your media so you have to go out of the app to do it,positive
latest update broke file sharing it no longer goes directly to phones file system eg gallery or directory and instead only shows whatsapp media in the all media section need  extra taps to share stuff now super duper irritating folks i have resorted to sharing directly via my gallery app instead,positive
this app was already deleted for months on my phone when i suddenly received a message to verify my phone in short someone is trying to access it on another phone i redownloaded the app only to be hindered by the verification and needed to wait for an hour to have another verification message be sent i want my account be deleted on this app,negative
everything works as expected just a suggestion add an option to share the messages and media to outside apps also this is a very basic feature which should have been there in the first time,positive
why is it that whatsapp always greatly reduces the resolution of an image once i put it as a profile picture in my gallery it would appear very clear with high resolution but once i put it as my profile picture it gets superr blurry and of very low resolution please you should kindly work on fixing this issue it is very annoying,negative

it is the best app for communication with friend and family worldwide but i have a point to improve it i would like whatsapp to have the option in the status to edit photos or postcards with music effects like facebook history thanks for your support and success business,positive
i have been using this app for my whole life it is good ngl it will be more easy if they add a feature where you can edit your own message after sending it like if you accidentally type something wrong you can just edit it so it would be easy,positive
since this morning the app does not open and start anymore last night it was still working and there was no update of the app in between but even after a phone restart i can now only see the splash screen for a split second android ,negative
after new update  no possibility to select photos from all media folder  after photos are found no possibility to select multiple photos very inconvenient with such excellent improvements whatsapp will lose long term users,positive
high efficiency pictures save space by capturing photo mode pictures in high efficiency image format heif some apps and websites do not support heif  reduce file size save space without sacrificing video quality the results will be saved in hevc format which some apps and websites do not supportis must be there in whatsapp,positive
overall the app is fantastic everything is good but there is a need of one more thing in this app the thing is there should be an apk file send option in files sending option when we send image audio or location etc there should be one more option of applications apk file,positive
update has ruined the app i can no longer send multiple pics at a time i have to go through my gallery to add each one separately gallery layout has also changed shows whatsapp gallery only until you click the top corner to go to phone gallery its an awful effort to share a few pics zero stars go back to basics back to when everything worked,negative
the new features are cool but when you want to forward a message to someone or a group it takes forever for that to happen kindly work on that and add new features like ability to put voice notes on status and the read receipts should work on groups it is only working for personal chats ,positive
okay i really want you to shift the archived chats to where they used to be i mean atleast nobody could see them it makes no sense to bring that on the top what is the point of archiving then i understand yall were trying to save the trouble for us by not letting us scroll all the way down to reach to the archived chats i appreciate the help but please put it where it used to be all the way down thank you everything else is great i like the latest update please fix this though,positive

hi guys hope you find this review infirmativeu my only concern with the app is just to make some changes in the app ui as ios just for some reference so you can understand because dark mode is not just a black pallet but it also pays a some sort of role in saving battery and also prevents our eye strain hoping to get a revert from you,positive
the new update is not intuitive at all especially when trying to attach and send photos camera photos does not show up in recent or in my all media folder while if i go gallery add photo it removes the photo that i have already selected before that,negative

gallery has changed used to be able to send the last picture taken now you have to take extra steps just to do that also you cannot send more than  image at a time which you used to always be able to do this new layout is a dud,negative
whatsapp is a great app but the problem with the new update is when i delete a chat it will not go down to the chat of the previous date in the interface if the developer could figure it out make it for the previous version  that is more easier,positive
it is very laggy and when i try to speak with anyone the person could not hear it and when i open whatsapp it shows that it is doesnt work and in icon the profile also does not work and when i try to send something to my friends it becomes laggy and the message which i send did not so can you please fix this problem,negative
you need to either take away that the icon popping up on your screen when you get a message or give people the option to disable it it is annoying when you are apart of many groups and the icon pops up everytime someone messages messenger does this and has done for ages and that was annoying enough,negative
i do not know what is wrong with whatsapp but i am facing this problem for pretty long i cannot send voice text to anyone i mean i can but it is literally blank i cannot hear my voice i can hear others but not mine when i send voice msg and hope whatsapp adds  mins for a status and make new emojis more especially heart emojis,negative

total privacy failure even after deleting a particular message the chat head of a particular contact stays at the top of the messenger indicating we cannot maintain privacy earlier whenever you delete a single message the chat head goes down to the last date and time when we sent a message to that person now many times whenever i had some personal messages with my friends and even after deleting the chat head stays at the top of present day very failure,negative

this update is not nice please you cannot attach picture with msg  u cannot send multiple pictures when you delete a message the person still stays on top voice not keep playing and stop please do something about all these thank you,negative
whatsapp could incorporate a feature that allows people to post pictures like instagram feed and allow people to personalize the list of people who can view these feeds it would take the app to whole new level also feel that customisable themes for the entire interface must be introduced,positive
cannot do bluetooth calls really like doing calls through my headphones as i can do things and whatsapp will not allow it to happen it is not the  separate pair of headphones it is the app fix it,negative
a great app but why does the archive folder comes on the top when you select the keep chats archived optionif it stays at the bottom it is much more convenient and mostly betterfor example if i have kept a chat in archive and the notification for that chat is disabled it does not has to pop out of the archives to show itself,negative
it was okay at first but now this app is getting annoying as it always messes with whatever status i am trying to upload although i upload my status correctly after cropping it however i want when i check it later the part which i had cropped out gets uploaded and the part which i actually want to upload it gets cropped outplease do something about this or else i might have to uninstall this appwhy keep it when it is not at all helpful to me,negative
why in gods name are you guys reducing the quality of my videos and pictures sent to your app it is really frustrating and trust me you do not even deserve the rating you have right now i had to update to the latest version to see if quality of images and videos was improved but sadly i was disappointed please ensure you guys make another update available this time around address the issue of reducing the quality of images and videos sent to your app and it should be done asap thank you ,negative

best chatting app ever but  one problem is im finding is everytime i voice call someone for too long disconnecting the call by low network performance but on the other hand from main voicecall it does not happen or no network problem but whatsapp do have this problem with voice call mins calling is ok around  min or  hour there started showing the issue and the rest is absolutely fine,positive
i cannot use whatsapp phone call and my phone at the same time it mutes my voice for some reason and i have to stay on whatsapp the whole time there needs to be a tablet version similar to desktop because i cannot use my mobile whatsapp and tablet at the same time like i can with a laptop which is really frustrating video call when my phone is on standby makes no ringing noise the settings are terrible and do not work when applied,negative
why is there no way to contact support i cannot get into personal whatsapp or business both say no connection try again but it never happens i cannot access whatsapp at all i have been using the same phone number for the last  years i have rebooted uninstalled reinstalled my internet is working for everything but whatsapp and i have tried to send a message on your website but after filling it all in there is no button visible to actually send it on phone or laptop,negative
this is oneplus phone on whatsapp only the sensors do not work right i cannot listen to a voice note with my phone at my ear because sometimes it will switch to ear and at other times not similarly it will not switch back from ear and it becomes impossible to switch back from ear before the voice notecall ends the screen stays off meanwhile,negative
the new update is the most infuriating thing possible you cannot send photos properly because it is only linked to whatsapp so you find a tiktok and then have to search through your gallery to find it and then send it to the person it is absolutely irritating as anything hate the update with everything in me please please fix this you are killing me,negative
its almost a very amazing app i just loved it and it is a very good thing to communicate others and to share any of the pic or videos or document and see the status of others who have to show us anything and wants to tell us and want to realize etc through status its just amazing to tell peoples indirectly even u all should download it its very amazing my opinion is to download it i liked it,positive
i would like to suggest that you make the starred messages option available for each contact instead of the general one that shows all starred messages in one place so it is takes less time to search especially when you have starred so many messages from different contacts and groups it will be way easier when you already know who sent you a message that you have starred and can get it right there in ur chats rather than having to go through so many starred messages btw i love the app,positive
since android  upgrade i can no longer set the phone gallery as the default folder to open i now have to go through a number of steps just to see my gallery i can only see files received in whatsapp by default now extremely frustrating this needs to be fixed asap,negative
i am not a techy to evaluate extensively but as a user i am happy with using whatsapp but i have a request to cancel showing us being onlineby choice people on the other end tend to think we are free and available for chat which may not be true always and get offended if we do not initiate a chat or reply them immediately which makes us delay opening the app altogether and miss out on important news or message something important i would appreciate if you can have a button to show online,positive
hey whatsapp developer team the app is fantastic as the numbers and ratings already tell i just wish there should be a way to turn off whatsapp even when you are connected to internet you are unable to receive messages until you turn it back on like a log in log off button without the hassle of adding credentials just a toggle button to either receive or not receive messages no matter you are connected to internet or not looking forward to such update soon other than that its awesome,negative
as much as i like the app since i was forced to update few days ago it is been the worst app ever as i no longer get notifications for messages even when calls come in i only hear it ring so i have to open the app to see who is calling and also be able to pick the call this is crazy at this point please fix this quickly it is no longer funny at all thanks,negative
after the latest updates conversations are not dropping in the message list even after latest messages are deleted highly inconvenient means you have to scroll through the entire list to figure out the unread conversations,negative
the app has has been fluctuating nad has not giving me smooth communication when u are on calls it will connect and disconnect connect and disconnect making it difficult to have a smooth conversation this has been on two weeks i even had to delete and dowload a new version thinking it was the problem it has been been like even the whatsapp business too,positive
previously when i used to delete a message from a chat whatsapp automatically use to resort the chat list according to date but now when i delete a message it does not change the chat list by date for example if someone messaged me last month and then again today if i delete todays message the chat will not move down to last month it will remain on top of the list with last month date on the right does anyone know how to fix this issue give us the option to sort by date pleaseeeeee,negative
i really like to text my friends and stay connected with them through this app but recently whenever i send them messages the ticks on the messages are not turning blue even though they have read my messages i have been facing this problem since  week because of this i cannot figure out whether they have seen my messages or they havent i literally have to call them to know whether they have read my messages so please kindly solve this issue asap,negative

i have the same complaint as everyone about the inability to share photos from my phones cameragallery directly from a chat i also am frustrated at the lack of ability to send more than  selected picture at a time from the gallery and the other issues in this latest update i do hope whatsapp or some clever person comes up with a fix and notifies us all,negative
bugs network issues poor ui redundant features creating extra steps to forward photos back ups have poor integration whilst messaging seems constantly delayed or slow honestly i hate it and it will not matter because there have been no improvements over the years frustrating platform,negative
the new update absolutely sucks on android you can no longer upload multiple photos none of your videos show in the gallery it is a pain to even get to your camera roll  only shows previously sent whatsapp media i use this app as my primary messaging app for friends  family in canada and in nicaragua  you have made this very difficult to use conveniently please fix this or i will find an alternative messaging app to use it would be great to message someone who is not in your contact list too,negative
whatsapp worked perfectly until yesterday when it made perform an update when i agreed on it it would not download it but keep telling me that it needs to be updated after uninstalling and reinstalling it is still the same problem when i downloaded it through an another apk it would constantly sign me out i have a huawei nova  phone thanks in advance for your advice,negative
if i delete messages from one chat the chat remains on top of the list without reverting to his chronological order based on the latest to oldest hence i have chats with the last message showing as of few days ago staying at the top of the list very annoying truly annoying,negative
video and voice call line still not very stable the disappear chat message is very annoying cause every time need to set once the user settings it and it should be set by the user not to bothering us  why not giving us a feature clearing all the messages instead of disappearing,negative
used to be good and the tech support is th rate about  updates ago they managed to break a perfectly good app the ability to send video stopped working with an unable to send video error message to compound this none of my messages to tech support have born any fruit and have to explain the fault every songle time months later it still does not work i now absolutely dread these mandatory updates,negative
i have a problem when i was calling through video calls it is happening ti now since the recent updates the problem is when i was on the video calls and then my camera is turned off accidently or not the screen is turned on profile pictures pp instead of just a blurry screen like before honestly if it is compared i like more the previous ones than these recent updates please to whatsapps team to fix this because it is so annoying thing for me as a one of daily user of video call thanks,negative

i just got a new google pixel  and the video call quality using whatsapp is awful compared to my old phones and to the camera app on the pixel  the video looks somewhat blurry on my own screen but is incredibly blurry and looks like it is in p quality on the recipients phone because the camera looks fine with the phones camera app and other photo apps on the phone i think the problem is whatsapp please address this problem thank you,negative

dear whatsapp please give us option just like telegram gives option of logging out we need pause and whatsapp as well it becomes too much sometimes your dual feature becomes useless because if we turn on internet messages received on both whatsapp app will be turned to delivered and we will be obligated to answer ps would really appreciate if you add option sending advance messages which receiver may receive later on the time we choose ps allow deleting chat and media by selecting years,negative
i really love what the new update brought to whatsapp fresh crisp and well designed interface but my issue comes with the fonts size on my status i so loved the larger clearer readable fonts in the previous updates,positive
i would give it negative stars if i could an absolute horrendous app whenever i take a picture it takes a whole year to load it and it is far from being my phones issue when i send  or more pictures to someone it kicks me back to the picture picker even if the photos still send and the pc app on the windows store is absolute dogwater it is so unstable it is not even funny it is just sad,negative
good that you are informing about the security code change but it seems to happen very frequently in large silent groups or personal chats they fill the whole chats please provide an option to clear these messages to keep the chats clean the only way i found is to star all the messages clear the chat and unstar them again but does not work for chats having large number of messages,negative
i am using a phone with a pop up camera last time there is no issue when i want to minimize my screen to go to another app and still keep the video call on and the camera is still up now the camera keeps on going down for no reason it is so annoying,negative
whatsapp is a good app for communication and it is easy but one thing is they are suck at is internet connection problem like for example when i open an app that requires a strong connection it can so that means my wifi is working but when i want to try sending a simple message to someone it does not send even when on group chat especially when doing a school project and i cannot send my messages same as posting status please fix this,positive

whatsapp is not showing call when phone is locked person who is calling see calling not ringing and if is connected it takes too long to connect more than  seconds this started recently earlier it was working smoothly,positive
remove the image compression often i send pictures or long screenshots containing text and my friends cannot see the text because of quality compression in whatsapp when i reached you via email you replied to avoid low quality profile pictures we suggest using an image with height and width of at least  pixels a user do not have to check all those criteria before sending image just remove the image compression and there will be no problem also add feature to hide online status,negative

whatsapp is great perfect with many features i would love it if it had some snapchat features though i would love to do streaks on whatsapp and see whos your friends and best friends its a great app but with streaks would be perfect  edit i can see whatsapp has added a bitmoji type thing so happy your acknowledging my feedback and would definitely change my review to  if there were streaks d,positive

notification does not work since the latest android upgrade version  and i have to click into the app from time to time to see if there is new messages which is very annoying and this delays me from getting messages  help,negative
it is great to use view once photos or videos feature as a private privacy policy but there is a flaw and i want to mention it here the view once icon is still seen on receiver screen  the view once icon should be only seen on sender screen why because the receiver will always be ready to screen shot its not possible now which is great or screen record what they are going to see if they see view once icon on their screen please make this possible in the future update thank you,positive

i am using this app for years and this is sooo gud compared too other im appswebs i like rarely had any problems with this over the years but overall it is soo niceand now it has more feature which makes it even easier to do conference calls and all sometimes some of my documents does not downloadrarely happened so i will let it goit helps me a lot though,positive
i really like watsapp for it is features but when it comes to sharing photos or videos it disappoint us by decreasing it is resolution so it would be better if watsapp consider this and enable us to share original quality photos and videos directly without sending it as doc file,positive
was really good before but recent updates have made sharing images randomly difficult when i click to send a pic it no longer shows my camera roll or recent screenshots  only images people have sent me on whatsapp i have to go to my gallery and individually share images from there,negative
edited to include i cannot get notifications that i have messages  it literally pops up and says popup notifications are no longer available in your version of android really what is going on with this app does the app need an update to keep up with the new phones i have a galaxy s used to be a great app but i suddenly cannot watch or send videos and their customer service sucks i have cecked all my settings and they seem fine ,negative

great app please if one deletes a message just delete the message and leave it at that that  you deleted this message still showing in the background is so annoying it is not so on similar apps kindly work on that,negative
biggest problem is that the more media you have in the chat more time it takes to load mediafiles section telegram loads it almost instantaneously also it would be nice to store encrypted media on the cloud storage without consuming storage space on the phone also have issues with chat not automatically scrolling down and suddenly jumping way up when scrolling up,negative
the app has changed messages stay on top with last person spoken to even if chat is deleted when i delete a deleted message a black bar comes up at the bottom that says undo just in the way no need for it please change back to usual app,negative
i really do not like the new update which forces us to view peoples statuses when only trying to view their profile picture i tend to view peoples profile pictures a lot as we text and now requiring extra clicks is so inconvenient for statuses which have a whole dedicated tab at least allow the option to disable or enable the new feature,negative
i am giving it one star because i cannot get rid of the annoying messaging dialog that pops out on my screen a thousand times a day it is unacceptable that i cannot turn off this feature i hate being distracted everytime someone sends me a message ,negative
backup needs improvement backing up either encrypted or not takes hours i will sit by my router literally for best connectivity with  gbps fiber line and still take hours i think a main initial gb backup is ok but every subsequent backup take just as long i wonder if there are data loss or corruption with the backup data and impact the whatsapp backup feature it is pretty messed up and time wasting,negative
whatsapp is the best official apk for sharing photos videos documents and much more it gives you complete security when you talk with someone it is video call and phone calls are really good because you can make a call from one country to another country without any cost only mobile data required you can chat secure call secure and a lot of things are secured ,positive
communicating with friends is made easier than ever in recording and writing thanks to the creatori like the way of recording than texting cause you can listen to a friends melodious voicestill we do go for pics that show up our curvaceous and bootylious bodies but the bad part is when one wants to update  it some times disturbing but all in all its good,positive

first of all when somebody change to a new mobile phone the backup  restore is disgusting whatsapp want our google account access thats is wrong on its part itself secondly even if we backup all our data to google drive it doesnot restore things properly never most of images videos  audios are not recognised they are shown to be downloaded again and during the shofting process most of the new unread messages are gone away pretty annoying and there are yet many more issues,negative

with the new update i lost the ability to choose photos from gallery to attach to whatsapp as many here has complained i had to go out from whatsapp and opened gallery instead in order to do so which works but rather tiresome as we were able to do this directly from whatsapp before please fix it and bring back the function,negative
i got blocked for spamming and had to register an entirely new number almost lost business this is completely ridiculous had that number using for years and i do not send broadcast messages so i dont know how their investigations led to me being guilty of spamming update i changed my number and woke up at  am only to see that my number is no longer registered is this happening to anyone else,negative

whatsapp has met all the expectations for social media communication except for the aspect of media quality whatsapp automatically reduces picture and video quality drastically when shared and it is quite unpleasant and inconvenient this problem has lingered for years and despite the updates and new features to the app this problem has persisted whatsapp would have been excellent if not for this issue please fix this,positive
new update with green ring around profile photo is irrelevant i do not find it useful there is already a section for status there is no need to put in on profile photos kindly find a way for users like myself who do not find this useful to have it removed,positive
the latest update in whatsapp is horrible the whole gallery is meased up only certain imagesvideos pop up in recent files when you either want to send an imagevideo or upload a status you cannot select multiple images to upload into status from gallery so using your status update to market goods is taking way more time than usual i am dissapointed and frustrated this is not a functional update it does not increase user experience in a good way,negative
this app would not be so bad if it did not insist on taking over every aspect of your phone i linked my contacts for one minute and now my contacts photos will not show up even after i have unlinked them whatsapp is a horrendous disease for your phone i would recommend using a real social media app for texts and calls instead,positive
this app makes it fun and easy to communicate with my family for example if i do not know how to reply i could just send a sticker speaking of stickers i got a new hobby of making whatsapp stickers yes unknown contacts are still able to message me even though i put contacts only in the settings but i still recommend downloading whatsapp ,positive
whatsapp should add the feature to download certain types of media files from certain groups there are times when i do not need to download any media files from some group while needing in others i cannot stop downloading unnecessary data from groups that have less priority,positive
whatsapp is the best messenger that i know but there is still stuff you need to fix after the last update there are some things you have to fix when i try to send a video or a photo it brings me not all of my photos it brings only one piece of my gallery and there is no way to find my other pictures and files,positive
do not see the point of disabling screenshots altogether in disappearing photos atleast allow the user to toggle it off for themselves if they do not mind their photos being screenshotted or allow it on a per photo basis the point of disappearing photos was to not clutter the storage and save only what was needed by taking screenshots this completely removes the benefit and reduces it is usecases to extremely few please allow users to toggle it off for their photos,negative
this version is not good because it limits some features to be used even can not allow sharing of large video to maximum  minutes and documents which exceeds mb also on massages it does not update them when sent and even deleted to the time of the current massage which makes it hard to trace the time when the last text occured,negative
great chatting app but has bugs  on voice recordings some messages start midway or skip certain parts of the voice messages when playing them and  the app abruptly scrolls up randomly in a conversation which is a nuisance,negative
support is poor after i upgraded my phone to android  whatsapp has an issue with video calls where the sound cuts out for me and the recipient when i end the call and close whatsapp the microphone indicator shows that whatsapp is still using the microphone and i have to specifically disable the microphone to stop it i tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling still happens i wiped the partition cache of my phone still happens i have contacted whatsapp support no help so far,negative
just  love it in poll option bug need to fix  not to choose more than one option  avoid change of option  during poll the result should be visible only to person who create the poll question not to the group members otherwise intermediate result may motivate others  option to share the final result after closing poll option thank you,positive
a lot of important work remains to be done like view delete messages hide personal messages lock personal messages put gift cover page on top of messages like instagram edit option the world is moving a lot man a lot of changes should be made today i agree the app is good but how to hold on to the same thing for a long time change is human development live not ahead but at least live with i think messages can be sent from anywhere so i did not like this app very much,positive
in the new avatar feature it will be easy for the user if gender characteristics are seperated both male and female options are under same option and also it is taking time to display when we keep on opening each and every feature,positive
best app for chatting or share information photos documents and videos but there have one problem when shareing a photo from gallery photos quality is very poor on whatsapp so i want to say that please reduce the shareing photos and videos quality  please fix this problem as soon as possible  i think all over users those are using whatsapp those are facing this photos quality problem  neither your aap should very useful for our peoples ,positive

the loudspeakerspeakerphone no longer works for whatsapp video calls it only plays through standard earpiece audio which is very impractical for video calls this is frustrating because it worked fine up until recently there is no way to change it in settings or during the call the problem only occurs in whatsapp ,negative
whose idea was it to automatically download pictures people send and whose idea was it to not have a universal setting to turn that off meaning you have to turn it off in every single conversation and thread and furthermore whose idea was it to not date the photos that are downloaded i have to scroll to the bottom of my gallery to find them,negative
i have found a bug if we are in a group video call and than pin a person video call by tapping on it for some time  there comes two option mute and message if we tap mute option the person is mutedie his owns mic is muted without his permission not only for mine but for all the persons present in call this is against his privacy it is solution is that if we mute a person than he should be muted only for mine not for all persons in call like google meet,positive
something has happened in a recent update and now attaching photos is complicated and tedious also only one image can be attached at a time and no message can be attached to the image please sort it out and put it back as it was,negative
this app is great for texting and calling someone and people this app is not such of a waste but i gave this  stars because i dont like how this app is allowed to say anything and bad words here my friend doesnt watch his language and she always say bad words and thinks its funny maybe if u could add if someone says a bad word but it doesnt get send because of the bad word maybe but the app is still good otherwise  stars,positive
i and others clearly have experienced troubles with attaching media from my gallery since last update it does not recognize my own media and does not show it as a option when i try to select instead i need to take a detour   option upper right corner and even then i can only select  file at the time it is a huge hassle,negative
the latest update is not very good the camera app does not recognize the phones media especially when it comes to uploading the desired photo instead it displays it on its own unnecessary random photo this update is completely useless and please fix it asap,negative
in attachments all photos and videos are not available only those shared and received within whatsapp are receivable this is veri irritating i want all the media my screenshots etc on attachment option currently i open my gallery select pictures and then share it to whatsapp,positive
it is been a beautiful experience but do something about the media compression when uploading there should be a setting where we decide if we want to upload in high resolution or less it reduces media quality to the worst possible outcome especially when you are uploading a higher quality media,positive
never receive the verifying code via sms and the waiting time for the only available verifying code via a call is so long and bugy especially when it failed to call you have to wait for  more hours for the next trying which has seriously affects the normal use after device system reinstallation verification asks for a phone number that threatens personal information security one account can only log in to one device stupid design,negative
wow this app is the best thing that a person could have but there is this one issue that i think happens to other people but i am not sure but anyways like we all love voice messages right so when i try to use it and when i send it for some reason the voice message shows  sec and when u tap on it it does not work and it will not say anything about what i said but please fix this issue because if i wanna type a long message but then i do not wanna type so i can use voice message so please fix this,positive
is whatsapp stupid to use phone numbers for registration instead of normal registration and do a user name  even there is an option to change phone number but some people not checking properly and texting to the same old number which has been given to some unknown person by simcard companies it is super confusing i travel lot of countries and it is very difficult for me and i believe lots of people have this same problem why whatsapp cannot do with user names  expecting changes soon ,negative
after the recent update unable to attach multiple pictures also photo view is different have to click so many steps know order to get to see screenshots or camera folder pls return back totally not user friendly,negative

whatsapp from meta is currently getting out of hands way buggy with the newly introduced features which comes with the update please kindly look into the features before pushing it here kinda hell lot of issues with this update and it is somehow moving from a messaging app to social media app too bad,negative
nice app but the latest update is weird if i am clicking on a anyones dp who has posted a status then it atomatically shows the status of that person and if i want to see anyones dp then i have to go inside that contact and then tap on the picture and then it will show a pop up box after that i have to choose whether i want to see the status or dp so its a long process for watching dp so this the only thing i do not like otherwise every thing else is fine,positive

great app could you please add a checkbox for those who use cellular data under international roaming i noticed that my phone does not perform a backup once the checkbox for cellular data is selected mainly because i am using roaming all the time in this case it is only working when using wifi connection thanks,positive
whatsapp backup and restore option is trash i spent days backing up my information such as chats pictures and etc on my old phone to be able to restore on my new phone even though it appears to back it up it did not i have worked so hard and was extremely patient still nothing after multiple attempts i gave up this app is a fraud backup and restore data should be one of the top priority for whatsapp,negative
honestly this is the top  social media apps to use people who do not like this application need to update this app in their play store  app store or they need to buy a newer phone because this app works absolutely fantastic had no problems with it although i have once received a message from a unknown phone number that i did not know saying its your friend lisa from college let us meet up again obviously if you get a text like this just block this stranger asap thank you whatsapp bye,positive
it is very useful but whatsapp video call quality is totally worst lots of improvement needed in video call voice  picture quality is poor when the video call comes screen become blank  i recently update this app but when i use whatsapp call the call is cut automatically pl fix this,positive
simple fast quick and easy although it does not have it is flaws here and there for example when you want to send an emoji it automatically sends you to stickers which can get annoying but it is not that bad anyway  stars until this little thing is solved then i give a  star review,positive
dear beloved whatsapp how do you do thank you for being so awesome and my goto realtime messenger app could you please do us all a favor in the next upgrade please include character numbering like instagrams caption entry in the written status update so that ones long epistles do not get cut off after posting because the user does not know the character limit when typing it can be really frustrating when we type our heart out only to see a portion of it later with love me,positive
the was perfect till the last update after the last update i am having a lot of problems with this app if i tap on someones dp is showing status and you have to go through a long way just to see a dp if i delete some message that i sent today it will still pin the chat to today list this app is been bothering now and i hate this latest new update plz undone this ,negative
downgrading my review as i am also frustrated by the issue others have reported about finding and attaching images from my phone and how much less functional it is than before very clunky and a much poorer user experience please fix this and revert to how it used to behave,negative
the one thing i hate about this app is that it refuses to use my phones vibration settings for notifications and is locked into a primitive short medium or long setting the only other alternative being off my phone can do a billion interesting hd vibration patterns all of which are quieter and less intrusive than even the short setting in whatsapp and all of which have no issues playing nice with my other apps it is whatsapp that is incompatible please bring this app into ,positive
no option for notifications of any kind if i have to open it forty seven times a day to see if someone has messaged me really does not make it anything but incredibly inconvenient,negative
i really love this appand the improvement and upgrades made on it it is really get more interesting if you do not mind i would like to suggest that some more features be added to it such as video record where one can drop a face recording of himherself jxt as we drop voice recordingsi guess this type of feature exist in telegram thanks ,positive

new version of whatsapp on pc from the windows store does not allow forwarding multiple messages instead you have to do it one by one searching for peoples names for a new convo also does not work and on a large screen the ui was made worse than before gotta wonder why is this being developed backwards and made crappier than the version before,negative
i have found an observation which can be an issue in this what is app version observation  on whatsapp from contacts if we click on the contact dp dp zooms out on clicking this zoomed dp instead of showing the complete dp the status set by the contact is displayed this observation occurs only when such contact has an active status kindly check on this observation if you think it is an issue,positive
update as of  october  new update new glitches on the app with difficulty making calls videos attaching photos the video call is not working the camera has no image for neither party the sounds is terrible and the attachment of pictures is a hit or missed this was after calling  different phone number with android or apple products in use hope the team gets to this soon and this is happening after the update and restart of the phone,negative
whatsapp was great for sending photos and we use it for work but since the new update it is been so frustrating having to go through and find the photos on my camera roll and only being able to select one at a time please change it back,negative
whatsapp is very good but please create a add where you can store whataapp images videos and all imported info except to save it on the server because whatsapp take a lot of space on your phone example when i use my camera i can setup it to store my photos on the memory card whatsapp cannot be setup to do that all whatsapp info is on the phone and takes up phone memory please technical guys of whatsapp,positive
after updating there are many shortcomings starting from unclear phone sounds and disturbed features a lot please fix this because i use this for communication how can my communication run well while the application has many deficiencies,positive
when i post something on whats app status the quality of that particular picture or video is being very low its becoming blur almost this has to be fixed i observed the same on others mobiles also,negative
i am beginning to hate how the image compression is done thus loosing the quality of the image even after choosing to best best quality images from the app it is a common problem with the long screenshot,positive
 unable to watch status privately  cannot change a viewed update to missed update  cannot use two accounts on one device  provides users data  shows number of muted groups and includes them on chat label  does not show who has and who has not received my message in group  stores data only on phone does not allow to transfer data and read data from sd card in settings,negative
its an awesome application for daily use if we are far from friends we can meet them live on video calls if we wanna send something statuschats emojis and what not we think of can be sent to our close relativesfriends whom we miss i love the new features but just one major problem that if we send a video of  minutes on status we have to send the same video  timesas it only allows a video of  seconds or else the app is great ,positive
im giving it  stars for now because my friend keeps spam calling me can yall make a feature to mute and automatically rejects a call from one contact only without blocking them it will be a good thing to add since people can be really annoyed about spam calls but they dont want to block the number please make this feature come true,positive
serious issue when replying from the status bar notification it just hangs with the spinny loading wheel the responses are sent but the quick reply popup stays instead of disappearing automatically and you have to manually dismiss it,negative
just great to be a member of whatsapp family  it is an outstanding place to interact with friends  family n colleagues etc only thing that can be changed is letting  message sending option at a time  otherwise excellent,positive
the recent update is the worst now you cannot see all albums from phone on whatsapp broadcast lists do not work you cannot find any pictures the gallery is not available on one click and when you do go to the actual gallery you can select just one picture useless useless useless,negative
hey i am currently facing that the voice note and message i send is read and heard by the receiver but it is not shown that either it is delivered or seen by the receiver no double ticks  no blue ticks this update should be finished it is totally useless  it seems like we are some kind of text messages app not whatsapp  such a boring function is this it should be finished,negative
status is not showing soon after the update i cannot download any media or documents from my dm i cannot even see the status updates of my contacts messaging experience had never been such miserable with whatsapp please see to it at the earliest,negative
sir please make the call option better when the call logo is just touched then it directly connecting it is one of the draw back of this app  when the call button is clicked add the conformation option that which confirms is the user wanting to call or not  the touching of the call button may be happened unintentionally it causes for the big problems in the communication this is not a review it is my request,positive
it is very annoying that some media cannot be sent to more than one person at a time if it was forwarded too many times this does not make any sense it is an app to share thing with friends what is the point in making restrictions another annoying thing is that some of the sent media does not load and that is very frequent and it is happening too often with so many poeple that was not the case before,negative
after the latest update i do not get notified of any messages even calls i can just hear ringing nothing shows up unless i open whatsapp the weird thing is that whatsapp business still works totally fine this is horrible,negative
after new samsung update my photos wouldnt show if youre having the same issue go to the device settings apps and permissions my photos and video permissions was unchecked was checked before the update allow permissions for photos and videos again it should sort the issue out hope this helps a few people,negative
as a user of whatsapp  i have seen one of the new feature ie poll selection  this feature is not so useful one can change their option as per the majority of voters  this feature is useless  it is is not baised at all another thing is we can select both of the option at same it  it is the major drawback of this poll feature  not accurate as well as trustable at all  according to me  you should modify this feature so that it will be helpful for others,positive
chats will not restore after changing to a new handset my google drive has been backed up on my old phone verified my number and i was never asked to restore chats i have tried reinstalling the app i have signed out and signed back in and still nothing could someone from whatsapp admin please contact me as i am missing a lot of important messages,negative

whatsapp calls are now coming through adls though they are regular what a terrible idea most calls are impossible to find and answer while the device is ringing and that is only if it even rings,negative
the back up on google drive never gets completed suddenly in the morning something goes wrong with data as it says on the screen whatsapp tries to restore and it does restore a month old data why in the world there are multiple everyday versions are being stored in the internal memory of phone what is the fuss can someone explain,negative
after sending a message it will show a couple check marks meaning the message was read by the other person but usually it is not accurate line is more accurate when it comes to message being read or not,negative
whatsapp has been a helpful app thus far i usually manage a lot of groups so the option to delete a message on a page as an admin has been helpful a lot since hacked accounts of members are used to post irrelevant info not related to the page i was going to suggest this a while back i wish to suggest another update for groups i want to be able to pin some announcement on the page so people are able to see it firsthand when they open the page or are alerted of a pinned message on the page,positive
after the recent update it is taking way too long to connect whatsapp call and video call even having proper internet connection same goes with downloading any media or sending any texts photos videos,positive
recently i have noticed that in my lists of chats if i delete one msg or a missed call for example that persons msg in my lists of all msgs from everyone does not move to the back of the line i do not know if that makes sense but basically if i have  msgs from different people and they are all in order if when they were sent and i was to delete the latest msg from the last person that msgd me he will still be at the top of my list of people who messaged me which is weird,negative
the fact is that the latest version is good because it can be registered on two phones but where the problem is the message do not sync so please work on that it would be great if it was made like telegram where messages sync very fast please help on that,negative
if it is possible to give a negative star i would been getting logged out constantly due to spam explain  whatsapp support worst ever  when i tried to log back it takes forever no verification code sent yet they claim multiple wrong attempts you log back in after hr  hrs only to get logged out again in a few short hours and you keep repeating the same process over and over fix it noticed in comments that this problem was common among my phone model users phone change needed,negative
notifications are not popping up after the android update cannot view the photos or videos received cannot send out cannot voice note when i received whatsapp call it does not even show,negative
i do not like the new update where when i am trying to view someones profile photo it takes me straight to their status now i have to go through the long process of viewing their profile and selecting view profile photo it was efficient when you see the green circle and know click to view the new status but there is no need for click to take you to status if there is not anything new just saying,negative
latest update makes sending images and videos impossible i have to root through my gallery which i cannot access directly any more and can send no more than one image at a time really rubbish update that needs fixing,negative

whatsapp needs sorting i cannot send pictures from my camera roll anymore without a big faff or send multiple pictures at one time the latest update has completely ruined it whatsapp has always been a favourite app until now,negative
i keep replacing my profile picture continuously after a couple of hours and this is getting awful and occasionally the names of my saved contacts disappears and it look like i did not save the contacts on my device initially this is annoying i think they need to have a new update on this app,negative
i had a suggestion for you guys their is a option where directly i enter any phone no and message them no problem i faced is i need to save the number which irritating especially when i just need to send him few photo or videos that is it so i has little suggestion to give us a option of direct message with saving their number just dialed their number and message them,negative
since a few days i have not been able to use whatsapp normally i am not receiving any messages they are delayed i have uninstalled and reinstalled the app again and it fixes but it does not last ps i am sorry if there is any mistakes in my review im not a native speaker,negative
this is a good app but i want a feature i am in th standard and i was checking my group then i saw that my teacher sent some work i was rotating fig by more options button but i accidentally click on delete button and my work got deleted and now i cannot recover it please add a feature so we can recover over notes etc,negative
the app is wonderful but i think it needs a bit of work concerning the colors at the status centerit could use a bit of creativityalso the archives need a bit of work to assist in hiding some contacts from the home screen,positive
it is  and it has been  years since my last review well i have discovered that the privacy features that were introduced  view once on media files the soon to be introduced view once text but my biggest concern is that we are still not safe if whatsapp still allows creepy apps like whatsapp gb to invade those privacy settings whatsapp must block all access from that creepy app until then privacy is just a term to make us feel safe but we are not,positive
please remove the photovideo features once view it is very disturbing to me so i cannot view the important documents that were sent in one view and if i cannot delete it please feature once view can be capture the screen back help please return the screen capture feature in the photovideo feature once view because i need a screen shatch if an important document is sent at a one view feature,negative
like others since update it does not work properly with photos allowing you only to send  it is made it useless and might as well just send a sms considering uninstalling if it is not fixed quickly,negative
i lost all the datas and messages after updating the whatsapp now notification is misbehaving in my notification bar the notification capturing the whole screen and unable to get back from the screen,negative
i can no longer get popup notification always have to go into the app and seen my latest msgs tried everything in my settings and the only thing i can find is that it is no longer available on the version of android,negative

basically what everyone else is saying unable to send more than  photo at a time unable to send videos completely as they just do not show up and the gallery of phone must now be accessed through  more additional steps please fix asap,negative
i loved whatsapp and used it especially for the quality of sending photos but after the last update my app does not recognise any of my gallery pictures so i cannot send any it is very annoying,negative
i have been seeing peoples settings and they have the ability to turn off their online visibility but this feature is yet to reflect on mine despite me updating to the latest update from playstore could you please enable this feature for me i need it if you do not do this in your next update i will rate this app lower and probably switch to signal,negative
this app is really good and helping in many ways it is easy to be used by all however if the inc will add cartain features as like online toast for the contact onlineit probably will be more interesting,positive
i hate whatsapp when someone calls up  it just pops up again and again annoying the hell out the ringtone also does not silent if i use the volume button i use samsung s i know maybe because its an old phone but still these should not be there in the first place,negative
really a good app for connecting with your friends family relatives etc this app have various features that are helpful for sending documents videos images etc a nice messenger app,positive

good a perfect way to get connected with friends and family overall it is a positive contribution to the community and people love it well i can not describe the feeling it gives me to be connected to friends and family so easily we love the video and chats as well as the texting it would be almost impossible or very expensive to get these things without this apps in my opinion everyone should be grateful and thankful for the service it has eliminated boundaries and brought friends and family in,positive
this app is really annoying as it doesnt notify me of messages half of the time and sometimes i do not get them even thought my wifi is on and is very good unless i literally have the app open allllll the time and whenever i am on call after a while it just starts cutting out and the call ends and needs restarting why also why do my reviews keep disappearing so stupid,negative
i lost all of my whatsapp photos and videos years worth of memories after filing a complaint with whatsapps help center all that i got was a very unhelpful automated message please do better this is unacceptable,negative
i love whatsapp cz its easy to use  has many great features but i recently installed dual whatsapp and i noticed that not a single media shows up in my gallery or storage i need to manually click on each photovideo and upload it to google photos only then can i see them in my galleryi have media visibility on i have selected all media even for mobile data restarted my phone and much more but nothing seems to work apart from manually uploading them on google photos pls fix this,positive
after the latest updates while in whatsapp call playing any videos in any browser such as chrome or brave will not work because of whatsapp call preventing any videos from playing by pausing the videos every seconds locking it on pause constantly this is ridiculous this never happened before and all of the sudden it happened please fix this immediately,negative
it was working fine till now but after recent update  whenever i try to send or forward the message the search option on forwarding screen become blank so either we need to go back and try to forward again or scroll manually please fix this,negative

ever since the  latest updates i have noticed i am not able to send any videos it keeps telling me there is been an error to try another video and it is the same i have a samsung galaxy s,negative
only good for messageing family but otherwise i do not really use it and is very glitchy and would not use if there was emergancy and had to call a pearant also why do i need wifi mobile data to message people like if i was dying i am not gonna go oh let me just wait for my data to turn on what if u do not have any left u want people to die why cannot u do no wifi  mobile data like messages on samsung and probably on iphone please fix this thank you,positive
nice app but there is something i hope developers can do it it is to make accurate digital input for status videos for example a video  minute but i wanna add it accurately between  and  seconds through digital input instead of editing the inaccurate editing bar which makes many of us angry,positive
the app has been an effective communicator  keep up  however personally i wish the problem of disappearing msgs can be solved eg an option to archive up to  months then erase automatically after  reminders,positive
sometimes if someone sends me a video it does not get saved in my internal storage despite of the fact that i have made sure the whatsapp setting to save to internal storage is on it is irritating also i cannot edit the polls people are choosing multiple answers at the same time,negative
after the recent updates there are a few issues that are starting to pop up   video calls are consuming a lot of battery  as soon as the participants increase over the call the frame do not fit the participants appropriately anymore  last seen time stamps are inaccurate,negative
the structure of the messages are so disorganized cuz when u delete the texts of a particular chat it still stays on the topwhich is v annoyingplease please fix this and make it like how it was beforebasically when u delete messages with a person n the last texts were few days before it is in the same order n not on the top,negative
i can only send one photo at a time and have to navigate through extra steps to my photo folder something is not working properly in the latest update please fix this issue thanks,negative
the whatsapp team is doing good to make it more user friendly  there is one suggestion from side please provide a saved messages section in the chat just like telegram  so that the user can put some text reminders pics files docs etc in it for quick access rather than sending them to any of their friends i used to send such files to one of my whatsapp contact who had blocked me  because it did not get delivered  but now i really feel the need of saved messages section,positive
i used to be able to send voice notes but now i cant i can receive them and listen to them when i press and hold the mic it just says recorder can not be set up right now try again later this has been going on for over a year and no one has fixed it and say that it is a phone issue which it is not because voice recording works in every other app instagram snapchat etc all permissions are granted i have uninstalled and reinstalled the app many times and cleared the cache very frustrating,negative
there needs to be a way where people who are not in your contacts cannot contact you it would be good if you confirmed a request then they could message need a way to appear offline update i deleted whatsapp it sucks and is one step away from a dystopian nightmare update i reinstalled and it is better how that i can appear offline and that there are avatars,negative
it is a very nice app and easy to use please work on the part that notifies someone of deleted file or text and the view once too it has to be a surprise else the recipient will take a screen recording before opening what you sent and please include the number of times your status is being viewed by one particular person would definitely give this amazing app a  star ,positive
i think everyone will appreciate an option to edit any misspelled message like imessage in ios the message will be marked as edited and even there will be an option to see the real message another thirdparty app telegram has that feature whatsapp is everyones favorite app so i am begging whatsapp team please add the feature,positive
there should be an option to delete a message already read by someone cause sometimes by mistake some messages get sent unintentionally and even though those are read by that individual those messages still make the conversation awkward,negative
edit i take back my    i cannot even post a photo status it shows up blurry to others usually would be a   but like so many others have said since the latest update the gallery attachments do not work properly now with android samsung  now not even photo status previously could not send edited videos with sound why do these things keep happening can this get fixed please whatsapp,negative
a lot needs to be fixed you mute the video sending to your status but still has sound when it is posted also i cannot crop the videos i am posting to my status whyyou think it is crops but starts from start when it is posted that is very frustrating,negative
why has no one from what is app responded to all the complaints about not being able to upload pics from phone cameragallery to send on android i too am having this issue after over  years use of no issues i would gladly rate this app  stars but this latest glitch since the end of november is extremely frustrating this is how i stay in contact with family overseas and not being able to easily access my photos and send multiple at a time is very very disappointing please fix the issue,negative
the last versions of whatsapp are actually taking away the originality and utility of this app i cant see if people are online or not its creating misunderstanding the shared photos are gone after reinstalling the app even though i had made backups new messages disappear while the app was reinstalled etcetcbottom line its really disappointing using whatsapp now a days,negative
if you have given the option to upload media file in high quality then why always we get worst quality when uploading status of images or video i humble request to you make this setting usefuland update with a new features for people who can share images or videos in good quality and stop us to go from mod version of whatsapp,positive
very bad experience on the app i am using this app because i have been forced to use this app literally nowadays it is one of the vital social media platforms from schools to offices what i found is that all of a sudden one of my very important chats entire message history got deleted how is that possible it is a massive loss to me,positive
i like using whatsapp a lot last week i changed my phone so i wanted to login into my whatsapp account on my new phone it goes very well in the beginning but when it reaches the initializing please wait a moment page it goes back to the profile info page after a long period of loading and then provides a message saying unable to connect please try again later i thought the fault was from my internet connection so i used a much better on but still i have not been able to login,negative
most of the time it is great and my favorite appfor messages however i have to force stop the app frequently like  times daily for my stickers to work and had to uninstall it and reinstall it recently to be able to send vids again update had the same issue again  weeks later too,negative
this is a very good app but i have a few complaints one is that i wish whatsapp could support status videos over  seconds or even a minute also i wish we had free mode like on facebook for at least texting another thing i would like is the ability to post voicenotes with no length limit on status,positive
 cant paste images  when i try to upload a file aight and i press upload file pick an mp file it treats it as a document without preview cuz i didnt specifically press upload audio  more support for file types go take a look at discord they actually managed to do that  also can i react with more than one emoji damn what a shame this app is i rly rly dont get why so many ppl use it unfortunately im forced to use it bcuz of that reason damn i hate wa bruh  peace,negative
the whatsapp product team needs to work on picture and video quality after they are uploaded to whatsapp statuses it is very discouraging to see your picture quality drastically reduced in this wayz i am not sure this would help businesses or creatives that want to advertise or post visualrelated works let us work on this for other features they have been great all along big ups,positive
i cannot use it because everytime i try to receive a sms with the code it says you tried many times which is not true someone else is trying to take over the account and even though i own and use the simcard still i cannot use watsapp on this number one month i have been trying to email the customer service the errors and shared screenshots but nothing has changed they just do not want to help zero for customer service,negative
actually watsap app has been and is still one of the best communication app though i do love it if the creators of the app include a scrolling bar so as to easily visit the old messages and also sometimes you want to block someone but you do not want them to know so if possible make it invisible to the blocked person that he or she is blocked this are my suggestion but presently watsap is so superb and i am enjoying it and i wish to enjoy it in future too thanks,positive
the most garbage fluke my data is on every other app functions on the network whatsapp neither sending messages downloading statuses receiving messages i had to test out whether internet was working with other apps most idiotic malfunctions when you actually need it to work,negative
ever since i last updated my whatsapp there are some bugs for example it glitches and doesnt show if my message have been delivered unless i close the chat and re open it or if i am on a call and the person does not respond and i call back the camera freezes and it unfreezes unless i close the call each of your updates are just downgrades really disappointed of how whatsapp have turned into what is the use of this community thing why does my photosvideos compresses each time i send it,negative
i only use this as no one answers texts anymore as they prefer doing it on this app as it is free but for me it has zapped my gb internet usage on my phone several times i was once in the gym for one hour after topping up my phone i came out to find that all my internet had been used due to this app downloading picturesvideos off messages in the background i then figured out how to turn off the the stupid auto download of the picturesvideos which is not said when first using the app,negative
sometimes all of sudden whatsapp server does not works properly i mean my internet connection is working properly but then too when i send a message to someone the message does not send and that freaks me out  suppose if you want to have some important conversation and you prefer whatsapp and whatsapp does this what will be your decision,negative
first of all this app has some serious issues with backup at first backup takes very long time than expected even after good internet connection and due to that sometimes it says that it could not backup secondly i did not like that fact that backup schema is so much wasted here for instance why customer has to backup everytime why cannot it be serverless like in telegram please do learn from them at last kindly bring the option of pinning messages in group and channels,negative
as the app working is good but only one defect was found that when we delete a person message then after chat list was not showing based on the date list it is showing the deleted person contact as a top listpreviously when we delete anessage from one contact it will be removed and sorted based on the date of conversation now it is not working in android users thank you,negative
latest update limits photovideo share hopefully they resolve soon update if you want to share multiple pictures or videos you must do it from your gallery select multiple pics or the video  use the share option  choose whatsapp app  select your contact you want to share and it will send like normal this is the work around i found to share multiple pictures at once,positive
i think there is a bug in the software if we delete the present days chat earlier it uses to que in with the previous date now it stays in the present date and this confuses the user please check and correct it immediately never expected such a lag from this developer,negative
i have a wish from whatsapp so i wish that all the features of whatsapp are good but if whatsapp brings one more feature it would be great and that feature is that like facebook it would be nice if there is an option to set songs so that when we set the statusif we want to put a song in our photo or video we can put it and the way we get the list of songs on facebook in the same way we get it here so please make these changes in whatsapp thank you,positive
i have been using whatsapp for years and overall i love the app recently though i have noticed a change to the voice note you cannot play it mid voice note anymore it makes you listen to it all over again which is annoying and does not make sense,negative
i do not see why if you do not have the newest version of a phone you need to sacrifice receiving notifications twice now this app has stopped allowing me to receive notifications claiming that the option is no longer available on my version of android getting a new phone fixed it at first but that is not going to be an ongoing occurrence,negative
after having latest updated version what is app had lost its originality now it seems like clone of instragramits not good every single thingespecially what is app has its own unique stylewhy do not continue the sameits not good showing status at the place of profile,negative
great app dec   not a great app for me anymore dec   i woke up to realise that my whatsapp was reset to when i started using whatsapp lost all chats and media have not been able to restore backed up data because apparently was deleted from my google drive still do not understand how this happened has been very frustrating and whatsapp support has not been of any help so i have changed my rating from a star to a star,negative
find it a decent app but really do not have a use for it other then chatting to folks on a personal level sharing images and videos from my content i have gathered and also like that it is another way to securely log in to other apps and for my device to use a secure password and to also help keep my passwords in check problem is it does not desply your own whatsapp number for the enduser conducting the app to talk to other folks has many features to change chats and group chats,positive
what have you done the best thing about the app was the ease of adding photos and messages together now you have to go searching for photos you can only send  at a time and you cannot add a message please sort this out,positive
terrible  time to update  cannot send photos through the app anymore nor we can send multiple photos it is been a while like this and it is taking too much time to fix suxh a simple solution ,negative
messed up  they left everyone even landline  tollfree numbers in your whatsapp phone book with an invite a friend link for each entry in your phonebookeven if already listed as whatsapp users now cluttering the whatsapp contact list with this useless feature in the send a message screen no way to hideremove it is obvious the developersowners are trying hard to get you to invite everyone to use whatsapp do not bother asking for help their auto responses do not help either ,negative
i love this app that allows me to co tact and keep in contact with people in other countries the sound quality is fantastic as if the person  miles away is sitting right next to you also i have nit experienced any dropped calls this whole year also love the voice message system,positive
sometimes i do not get messages as they are sent and they then come all at once and sometimes it does not notify me when i do get a text regardless of my phone being on vibration or sound it just comes in as if my phone is on silent,negative
i would prefer the blurry version when someone paused it when videocall because if anything happen we can still recognize what are they doing especially if something happen like car accident or something else we can still recognize what happened even it is blurry please bring back the blurry version ,negative
easily the worst app i have ever used meta claims that the chats are encrypted and your info is safe but they cannot keep your number safe from leaks or bots i have gotten so many scam texts and calls that even if i uninstall i get them on my actual line meta needs to fix this in a way similar to telegram or signal before bragging about security they do not have,negative
worst app i tried the new feature endtoend encryption password on chat backup but while trying to restore the chat backup whenever i enter the password everytime it shows something went wrong please try again later i contacted whatsapp and sent a mail along with screenshot but got no solutio why you introduced this feature when you have no solution to this problem,negative
worst update ever i cannot send videos from my gallery anymore and when you want to send pictures from your gallery you have click on the three dots and go to your gallery separately instead of having acces to it immediately when you click on gallery in the chat i am so frustrated with how inefficient this update it throw the whole app away,negative
hello whatsapp llc it is a great app but you will get  stars from me after fixing following issue  earlier when we used to upload status the text was automatically center aligned which was good but now the text is left aligned even if we write in a righttoleft language  there should be an option to edit status thank you,negative

the bugs have been progressively increasing for the past one year there is a weird bug while scrolling up the chats whereby it scrolls up to  or  days earlier instead of the recent chats i suggest you prioritise squashing your bugs than providing new features the app is getting less stable by the day the community feature you introduced was not necessary in my opinion,negative

nice update but it bothers me when i updated i cannot ss the one view pictures of course but i am confused to how come my friends updated whatsapp and still can ss one view pics some of the people i know has not updated yet because they still wanna ss one view pics my suggestion is to pop up a force update notice on the screen when they enter the app it will not let you continue until you updated it i know my suggestion is a bit harsh but please do understand its for the sake of privacy,negative
terrible update you can only select photos that have been sent through whatsapp to send and have to press thee  dots to select your gallery which then you can only select one photo at a time and you cannot send videos why on earth would they even change this,negative

i have enjoyed the app and am ok with what it has been given it nice knoww that i could chart and call at the same time and still enjoy the internet service but you need to improve on the calls network and the picture quality and most of all the data should be less for people to be able to continue to work and enjoy your services thanks,positive

my experience in using the app is nice but i would appreciate it if you add my suggestion in your settings i suggest you add a setting where by you can set your whatsapp in such a way that only those people in your contact list can chat you up not some stranger you do not know and not for one to wait until the stranger chats himher up before blocking but if there is such in existence already please i would love to be directed on where to see the setting in the app thank you,positive

latest update is not providing option to upload photos from gallery when the camera icon is clicked it is only displaying whatsapp photos it is inconvenient to go to the three dots choose gallery and choose photos from albums,negative

new update sucks i can no longer see any of my new photos in whatsapp when trying to send them i have to exit out of the app to my phones gallery and send it from there via the whatsapp link who thought this was a brilliant idea i will no longer use this app if this becomes the norm,negative
i do not know if its because of android  or the new update of whatsapp but now the app is broken if you take a pic or a video it is gonna take the app hours to realize that you did and before so you will not be able to send it anymore from the app you must get to the gallery and share it from there for example about  hours ago i took a pic and until now it is not shown im my recent pictures and i am not able to send it easily let alone the videos which are a whole different kind of ball game,negative
a very good app to use and it could have been  stars but the problem now with the new update is that when you want to view someones profile picture and that person has uploaded status it will automatically go to open the status even though if you do not want to view the status that is actually wrong please do something about it,negative
pleaaseee for the love of god stop reducing the quality of pictures or videos when we upload them either on our story or display picture please consider adding a replay of a story instead of automatically going to the next contacts story also try adding an option to select the duration of a story instead of just  seconds  its frustrating of only being able to upload a sec video,negative
whatsapp interfering with other apps on android while on video call on whatsapp you can not listen to other videos on websites to be able to watch the video the videos audio cannot be active this started happening on last update once you end the call all videos work fine please fix,negative
this is helpful to contact people you want to contact yourself but is also unhelpful in the sense that it will not even let you send a message to someone without requiring access to your phone contacts if i want to add them from my phone i will i do not need whatsapp making it so that the option is forced out of my control,negative
user friendly simple but effective i really like this app one of the best ways to keep in touch with friends and family i noticed you introduced a poll option in groups can you also add that poll feature to the whatsapp status and also i think going live on whatsapp would interest people more,positive
whatsapp itself is fine as it very easy to communicate however in terms of customer service its very different to ask help i have provided the details and kept on repeating the troubleshoot i should do which sounds like they are not reading the exact content of my email very frustrated already,negative
i actually really like the app hey i am able to chat and video or voice call with my family and friends the only problem is that it limits the seconds your status should besecs and how many videos and pictures you are allowed to send to anyone videospictures but overalli really really really like the app,positive
new community feature is terrible it is not useful for  of users i thought it is up to me alone to control it but when i used it it merged all contacts in the  groups that i added to the community without prior notice and it notified everybody in those groups as a result some people left because you cannot use their numbers to merge in same community without asking them i was ashamed of what the what is app did,negative
after the recent updates the app runs slower and heavier the photos downloaded are blurred before i opened it i have to tap to open the photos so i can see it without blurred and somehow peoples stories with photos are also blurred i cannot see the photos please fix it asap it is inconvenient,negative
edit have tried using wifi cellular app with cleared cache and two seperare google drive accounts backup constantly gets stuck of you do a google search on the topic hundreds of articles are written on it meaning it is been an issue and for so long that hundreds of people wrote about how they fixed it shows that whatsapp cares zero about the issue or it would be explained or solved by now,negative
for those having trouble sending videos because its taking forever to upload doest upload at all or plays fast and doesnt sync audio lower the resolution that your camera takes video on for some reason it cant handle anything longer than  minute on high resolution solution lower the resolution example from x to x started happening after the latest forced update ,negative
it is a good app but i think it must need some new salient features such as a like option on a status like an instagram which may be helpful for the people who do not use instagram through this they can show their feelings towards that people whom they like the most through this option the people who do not talk to each other due to shyness but they like each other can share their feelings so i think the whatsapp should add this feature for making it more worthy,positive
there is no way to turn off receiving calls whenever a group you are in decides to make a call there is automatically a full screen popup to tell you and there is no way to disable this it has interrupted many important moments and has made me consider uninstalling the only thing that has kept me installed are family groups,negative
good app works well for me  update since the last  updates i now have issues with notifications sometimes i get notified of new messages sometimes i dont very frustrating  i have to constantly go to the app to see if i have gotten any new messages,negative

yea its good and all but one thing that frustrated me is the quality of media that i posted on status why cant i post it in high quality developer should add the option for the quality of media that users uploaded i took a nice pic on my cam in hopes to share the result only for the quality to be reduced the app really does not feel as smooth as telegram maybe optimization should be added,positive

previously when i used to delete a message from a chat whatsapp automatically use to resort the chat list according to date but now when i delete a message it does not change the chat list by date for example if someone messaged me last month and then again today if i delete todays message his chat will not move down to last month in fact it will remain on top of the list with last month date on the right does anyone know how to fix this issue,negative
great app what i found annoying is that i can not edit the messsage after hitting the send button i do not like auto correction becuase is not that smart yet so this app force me to delete and send a new message most likely with new typos please implement updatesentmessagemsgid newmsg thanks,positive
as mentioned previously the latest issue now prevents the user from directly attaching photos taken with the camera the only way to do it is to go to google photos then share to whatsapp and select the chat whereas previously you were able to access the photos you have taken directly whilst in the chat needs fixed,negative
there is some issues for me if i compare with the precious version when in the previous one we still can take a screemshot or screen recording while we see a view once message from somebody but in this version we are unable to take with it which is this feature decrease of usable storage just for sending or receiving some images or videos if it is not very important while in the otherwise there are some of messages that very important that we want to know secretly and wihout using so much space,negative
the latest update has ruined the text status feature before the update the text would change size gradually from big to small depending on how much text was used now the text just drops to a very small font even with just  words what is the point of text statuses if we have to squint to see them,negative
i recently updated to samsung a  i am having issues with very slow up and downloads used to be super quick not sure if it is my carrier or what also people not in my contact list show up and i have to delete them this app very useful hope i can get it to work correctly,positive

the data restoration on this is absolutely awful the app recognises that i have a back up in my drive so why is not there an option to load it rather than jumping through flamming hoops to get nowhere   edit i finally did it after copying the files from my old phone and reinstalling the app by uninstalling and reinstalling via the app store rather than uninstalling from the home screen,negative
hi whatsapp team this is to inform you that i know very well you have added send document option but even then you have to add an option if we send an image from the gallery then the options will appear whether you want to send the image original or compromise the image quality and second thing if i select  or more image or audio video then option will be shown only whatsapp sharing option  but other app sharing option is not showing why so please add this option it is very useful,positive
slow and horrible message received notification non existing you have to open the app to see it trying to call it is a nightmare calling message on the screen than ringing but in the end line cut you make it very confusing with this calling than ringing notifications without any tone just horrible annoying experience,negative

recently message do not come in until i open the app notification is on yet there would be missed calls and msgs but i have to keep checking to see if i have received any i have been using popup action for ever unfortunately does not seem to be working anymore i probably have to get rid of the app because it is ridiculous to be going through that process to get ones msgs etc ,negative
i do have a suggestion why do not we include music options in whatsapp and when we upload a status it is better if there is a option for mute the original sound and by music option we can add songs we wanted why do not we consider this optionit will be more attractive and useful i thinkmany peoples must be thinking about this,positive
chats are flickering in chat page display picture and chat when something is happening in the conversation such as change from one tick to two ticks or to blue ticks or if recipient is recording a voice note or typing this will only occure when in chat page not within the conversation edit issue solved with the last update thank you,negative

i want to suggest one enhancement here by mistake i sent an image in a different group i did not want to send message in that group so i clicked on delete option which has  suboptions i wanted to select delete for everyone but i was in hurry and i selected delete for me now every one could see that image except the one who sent  that is me there should be a feature to retrieve the deleted message,negative
i am facing quite a lot of bugs in the new update i keep typing and sending the but it just doest not send until i close and reopen the app there is an option of reply to a message in chats in past after sending the message the app would take you to the most recent message now i have to scroll back down,negative

has something just changed up until a few days ago if i had multiple voice messages they would play automatically one after another for however long they went for but now they stop as soon as my screen times out so i have to keep tapping on the screen to keep them playing it is so annoying how do i make them keep playing even after screen timesout and locks,negative

overall the app is good and excellent but now there is a time to insert some new and advance features like to have some password or pattern or fingerprint on some person chat or group setting will have also to be updated to have the lock  features please make it sure for the case of privacy of every person this will makes it more efficient and advanced for the users to use it as compare to gb and other whatsapps,positive

installed today cannot even get a profile picture to upload gets to the initializing screen then errors out on a mb connection tried to sign in on the web but it requires the app to work and the website was spinning where the qr code should have been the status checker says the service is working normally how do people rely on something this bad if this is normal i do not want to see what a problem looks like,negative
the recent changes in the app have been commendable just one more request please add a feature where i can hide a group for a definite indefinite period there are some groups you are a part of but you really do not want to be a part of and cannot exit for whatever reasons,positive
overall this app is great in every aspect i like it very much but previously some updated features are not good such as story update on overall contact in chat with green circle is the wrost way  if we want to ignore someones story but the circle remains there and second one when you open dp the status showa up this is not acceptable at all,positive
i have been using this app more reliably then text for the last few years superior however the recent update now only shows me photos that are inside whatsapp and not my gallery or camera without a few extra steps every time can anyone help undo this frustrating it cannot see media on my phone,negative
storage issue whatsapp is  mb let us say you are about to send someone a file and you also have a movie in your phone of size  gb if you mistakenly click on that movie even after canceling whatsapp will save it somewhere and you will not be able to delete it now your app size is gb mb  other data my current whatsapp app size is  gb while i only have files  gb of files privacy issue end to end encryption is turned off by default i am only using this because everyone else is,negative
forced me to setup the backup settings with no skip options never block and force users to do anything it is incredibly frustrating and against any interface basics i had an urgent message to send and i was forced to spend  infuriating minutes to configure my google account it was definitely not the moment,negative
i use this app more than any other messaging service on my phone the new update has completely ruined this app for me you can no longer send multiple pictures at once and finding your gallery was almost impossible at first put it back to the way it was before,negative
i cant stand this picture attachment nonsense why would you get rid of seeing everything from your gallery everytime i want to send a screenshot now i have to go from my gallery and click share to whatsapp then the conversation such nonsense so long winded and for what reason also not being able to press down on an email address and click copy only having the option to open email apps is very very annoying fix this please,negative
please remove the feature of veiwing status from profile picture by the side of the chat so that the mantra of connecting people of the app stays intact because i feel people will eventually start getting used to see status there itself then the status section of the app disappearing message is a really good feature include group chat also for disappearing messages give edit option for caption in status after adding it to the status if any spelling errors would be useful,positive
after an update the whatsapp web really delayed i cannot view my previous message document links like before and in my phone it really not friendly user anymore when i want to upload my picture  i cannot attach it many in the same time and i need to click it one by one please fix this i prefer the older version of this whatsapp app,negative
in latest update in whatsapp as introducing communities is might be good for family  organization and group of friends i will suggest that there should be another update like the upper mention option that separate the groups from the contact chats totally it looks like a bulk of data  messages  audio video clips  sticker  emojis etc etc that is awful  everytime this new update will be helpful and attracts the previous and new users as well thanks a lot for your attention,positive
while scrolling there seems to be a new bug which directly makes us skip a few of the messages and secondly there seems to be an error with the message delivery system where i have to reload the app to know that the message is either sent or seen by the other person  the tick and clock remains static while in the chat without changing until i come out of the chat,negative
using this app is a terrific method to remain in touch with friends and family that live abroad i am unable to send or share video media though as of late receiving this error notice repeatedly is becoming unpleasant and frustrating look into it please,positive
normally all is fine edit but this time around after my app and phone update all the permissions were revoked for some reason i could not see my gallery to send photos and files until i realised it is due to the permissions which were on so no idea why was that changed,negative
my server is working fine but the messages that i am trying to send somebody shows that clock sign for hours after i cleared the data and tried to login it says try again after  minutes i am so pissed off after trying it again and again i have some really important messages to send somebody for which i only rely on this app do something,negative
hi i really like this app i do use it in a regular basis every day but some times it does slow down and let me down i used to use other similar apps but they are not as flix able as watsapp that is why watsapp becomes a primary app to me also almost all my friends and family use watsapp so it makes it more comfortable to use despite all of its good points it has its own downfall as well such as when you delete a message it remain on the page and indicates that a message has been deleted,positive
chatting interface is good enough that is why it is a highly used app but sometimes whenever i try to see a status in low network coverage zone i cannot and even after i come to a good network coverage zone i am still unable to see it it just keeps on loading forever hope that whatsapp looks into it,positive
rubbish after update cannot attach photos taken after a certain date the attachment search only sees part of what is saved to your phone to send them you have to find the picture in gallery and send from there one at a time annoying please fix,negative
this app deserves  stars but there is no option sometimes we are not able to play the voice i just click on the option but it does not work and second you all should allow group calls on pc laptop and computer version that is all,negative
why did you ruin the photo sharing ability i actually have to go to my phones gallery to select multiple pictures in my cameras folder if i try to share through whatsapp it only shows contact folders and i need to click  times to find the camera folder it worked perfectly for ages until the recent update ruined my favourite message app,negative
great how this app used to be great but every update destroys it more when backups came out i always had it on but when it became always on i did all i could to turn it off the auto backups didnt delete the last save meaning i had  mb files plus they removed the option to choose the time for back up and i am still using the app at am now today i get in the app and all my messages are gone my last one saved is from march and i have to reinstall the app to even get my backup to work,negative
overall goodplease provide the below things  provide an option to undo while typing  profile pic cannot be uploaded full it crops which is a very big problem  please provide option that message could be listened and allow to edit status after posting  option to schedule message  categorise msg like individual and groups in another space,negative
same issue as other reviewers latest version on android  makes it impossible to send multiple photos within app as it only shows limited images work around is the three dots to view all photos but can only send one at a time and no video please fix,negative

my comment from yesterday  is not here   here is a new one  cannot restore my data account looks new after installing it to an android phone previous was iphone  old model  no access to whatsapp  asked for help from whatsapp  got a most relevant answer   to turn media visibility on or off for all chats  open whatsapp   the media visibility feature only affects new media that comes in once the feature has been turned on or off and doesnt apply to old media,negative

whatsapp used to be the best before facebook bought them now they truncate videos and pictures down to terrible quality and now since a samsung update you can no longer attach pics or videos from your gallery direct from the message same as last review you have to do it a much slower way not sure if it is a samsung or whatsapp glitch i am messaging with a rep but feel it is a robotic rep added i figured out the issue i had to open permissions and go to whatsapp and add photos and videos,negative
the app is fine but when you try to send a voice note for some reason you cannot really hear your recording properly sometimes you can but sometimes you cant this is really excruciating and annoying it is not like i covered my mic,negative
this version has a lot of bugs sometimes we just scrolling a particular chat but for a single scroll it landed on somewhere else of the chat and also when we are opening the emoji section it will open for just half of the normal range only after  to  taps the section will open normally too poor version,negative
latest version is not functioning as previously now you cannot upload a picture taken with the phone camera app you have to go through this cumbersome nd step to access the phone gallery app at the top right  dotsthen can you only see phone camera app fotos to upload this is not a great user experience further uploading a photo taken with the phone camera app is also impossible keep receiving an error which says cannot upload fix this please,negative

the new update is the worst thing ever  you cannot even send one time viewing pictures which you cannot make screenshots off no more either which is completely dumb from your laptop no more let alone open them  and for me someone who uses their laptop for everything this is just so silly also in group chats the profile picture is also showing up next to ones message which is just ugly and unnecessary cause the name of the person is there anyways,negative

over the past two weeks using whatsapp was fun previewing links from status was nice but i want to ask if whatsapp was made for ios only cuz it seems we on the android are destined to forever be backward why bring an update and then retrogress back into the former i want to state that i hate the bing font on status updates bring back the link preview meanwhile duplicate the feature that enables users to click on profiles from chatlist to view status android users also matter,negative

whatsapp in itself is a good app but recently i am being flooded with fraudulent and spam messages and its really annoying it would be much better if whatsapp could add a feature where unknown contacts cannot message or call me on whatsapp unless they are in my contact list hope whatsapp team would consider adding this feature soon it would be really helpful to protect us from fraudsters,positive

would be a  star but whatsapp really needs to have a voice activated option for recording voice clips voice messages are the future of cb radio on your phone the driving and trucking world would be very appreciative to have a voice activated voice clip function or release a whatsapp dedicated earphone which does it at the push of a button,positive

i cant send pictures or videos direct from whatsapp i have to go back to my gallery so annoying the worst part is when making call it will end with error that  call ended because there is a problem with your devices microphone try retartibg your device and try again ,negative
the updated version is very cool especially the polls but you should make it in such a way that someone can only choose one option but here lies the case one whatsapp user can choose all the options available it is very bad please do something about it the poll should also have a deadline,positive
usually a great app now with the change of having to go in deeper to attach pictures or videos is ridiculous please leave it the way it was i am not able to to select and view at the same time either,negative

whatsapp has changed recently and now i cannot send multuple photos from my phone unless they have been previously received via whatsapp i even need to go through a couple of extra steps to access my photos folder i do not know why they changed this feature and want to priorotise whatsapp folders but it is gone from being the best messaging app to now worse that facebook messenger who the hell are they paying to write the code for this app because if they keep this up they will kill it,negative
the new features are great however i want to recommend that you introduce a link reset option for the call link so that when a user creates a link for a group call when it is done the link can be reset and made unusable,negative
quite disappointed that whatsapp does not let you choose sd card for default data storage this should have been the developers top priority for an app that can fill the internal storage so rapidly i know several people who have stopped using the app for this very reason,negative
ever since i updated to android  i have been unable to send photos not taken in whatsapp i used to have the option to browse my gallery within whatsapp but now i am only seeing media sent or taken within the app i have to go to google photos and send it from there hoping this is a bug that can be fixed ,negative
previously had issues but looks like it has been resolved the app appears to be more reliable than the network service providers especially mobile calls really appreciative of the effort and service provided by the developers,negative
it is really good but just one thing about the new updates the feature that allows admins to delete anyones message only works one message at a time if you highlight more than one of someone elses message then it does not come up with the option to delete it for everyone else is that intentional,negative
whatsapp media does not show up on my gallery anymore for some reason and it is not a malfunction in the phone as far as i know i cannot even share the pics i get on whatsapp till i transfer them to another folder which is annoying i liked whatsapp in the past but due to this issue i am starting to get annoyed using whatsapp,negative
whatsapp i meant tell you guys from a long while about this i dont who out there feels the same way also but is there way that certain videos can be sent to someones status without having to trim them in stages because it really takes up time esp if its a min or two sometimes you have to just send the video link instead could you please do something about that limitation  give an update on that asap ,negative
it used to be great but sucks at transferring data i wasted more than  hours to back up my information to move to a new device and it was for no reason whatsapp support did not help at all and made me feel like i am stupid or was not trying everything they were telling me already this used to be the best app for chatting with family but now i am going to use something else so highly disappointed i have lost everything,negative
it is nice o buh i frown at the low features of the whatsapp it does indicate when a friend is online it should separate friends chat from group chatshaving different role for eachso that one can easily locate any chat or any group if the features of gbwhatsapp can be included in this one i believe it will become more interesting thanks my whatsapp keyboard has changed o the place for another paragraph has changed to sent and since chats have not been interesting ,positive
the app is much more secure than just about any other app out there still have not gotten a straight explanation on how and where to retrieve the messages this needs a rethink and going over to make it much more convient so at this time because of that flaw especially in the business app it could negatively impact any businesses that needs and received messages so thumbs down fix it gentleman,positive
great app i would recommend for any social media lover the recent update on the app is really poor you could make calls and still access other apps what i do not understand is why there is now restriction on this feature secondly people can still see and reply to a status update that was deleted this does not align with the apps privacy policy i believe all whatsapp users would appreciate it if these little flaws are fixed best regards,positive
this app has completely spoilt to add recent pictures you have to click on the  dot line on the top and choose gallery before you can view the screen like it used to look and i cannot see how to make it stay in that view what a terrible and pointless change ,negative
first whatsapp is a must have messenger app here whole region second the app works welleasy multi features as a messenger app especially broadcasting assigned group communicating now community this thatexternal supports from other imperative apps all inapp accessed updates installed like on dayto day schedule etc third and the greatest of all it is totally free no premium and it has perfectly all features even a premium can not compete with i am decades user of whatsapp,positive
i do not know why whatsapp keep changing the settings and format frequently most of modifications were annoy and nonsense the latest change was the sorting of contact persons when i deleted the latest posted chat from someones account the someone will keep at the toppest sorting position yesterday and before the someone would be returned to previous sorting position,negative
talk about going backwards i had an old phone repaired and used a cheap one in the meantime went to download an old backup to find you cannot do this now so i have lost  years of chat history now cannot register for  hours  minutes so not even my customers can get through ro me thank you whatsapp great work you do,negative
the last two updates come with annoying issues when personalizing sounds for contacts a real mess to the point that notifications sound plays along the recorded message or any incoming voice messages or calls one stupid solution was to reinstall and not personalizing sounds for contacts,negative
the volume cannot be adjusted on a tablet this makes it very difficult to speak on calls the tablet switches to portrait mode for calls the handsfree mode on a tablet makes no sense overall tablet support is very poor,negative
mist ridiculous frustrating backup and restore system why cannot you backup and restore your chats locally features are also behind every other good similar app hardly any new features ever added theming options are also ridiculously terrible only keep this app around because of a couple of my contacts,negative
overall good app but whatsapp has a glitch that even if i have internet connection i still cannot send any messages some of my friends have also tried sending messages but it did not work too and if i call someone it says that i do not have internet connection even though i do hope you can fix this glitch,negative

i switched to an older one plus phone since then every other day i get banned for an hour or two hours it is just random i do not even do marketing on whatsapp just communications it is so annoying  i have uninstalled and reinstalled number of times i lose all my texts but this just keeps happening,negative
i love whatsapp a lot the quality of the calls are good the backgrounds and look is nice and in general its a great app there are regular but not too often updates and they always try to improve but this app would be even more amazing and fun if we could and filters on the camera its would be great for people who arent allowes to have snapchat or aby other apps reply if you agree,positive
now this is a really good app but there are a few things i would like to be added  i would love if you could make little avatars and i heard you might be doing that also instead of the caption at the bottom it would be cool if u could move it and it be like snapchats speaking of snapchat you should also add some filters that u can post on your status or just save them  thanks for reading  x,positive
this app is so frustrating if i wanna upload pictures on my status it takes up to  minutes most times and if i wanna delete a post it can take up to  hours and during that time no messages will come in and i will not be able to send messages,negative
i have not faced any problem yet using this appi think it is very amazing the way it is only a few features on privacy need to be updated as well as backing up of messages as it takes a long time to do so but keep it upits improving everyday,positive
it gives me the opportunity to relate and communicate with people at a higher level even as a group to make better and easier contact with othersdespite the challenges with the internet at times messages can be relayed at a faster paste,positive
for some reasons my whatsapp is showing a few contacts that are nowhere saved on my phone i tried reinstalling the app changed permissions resynced contacts but its still the same how can i get rid of it  i do not want to breach anyones privacy as the phone numbers display pictures and status for these unknown contacts are visible to me,negative
it is quite amazing app  but now i am going tell about a new feature sometimes i was writing a message but accidentally closed whatsapp so my message that i was writing has been deleted  so i thought if it has a feature that while writing a message if whatsapp closed automatically then the message i wrote will be saved as draft it is quite usable i hope you see my review and think about it thank you,negative
not sure if there is a bug but i have just had android  installed on my phone and now the only images i can attach to a message are images i have received through whatsapp there is a longwinded way to get to my gallery but it only displays photos not videos i now have to share the imagevideo directly from my gallery,negative
attachment options for pictures no matter the method in app camera button or paperclip now only shows whatsapp photo folders i then i have to hit menu then gallery if i have already entered text and then do this method it also deletes the text after attaching please fix,negative
cannot attach photos from gallery first thing that shows up when i click on the attach sign is whatsapp images instead of all albums then in the camera album it will not let you select more than one image why change something that works,negative
invasive backup notifications that cannot be cleared constant unwanted backups and my account keeps getting messaged and called by scam accounts fix how how personal data is collected because it should not be that easy for them to get in contact with me,negative
i think this app interface needs to be improved for instance  contact chats and group chats should be put separately  there should be a widget that helps users download photos from other peoples status  there should also be customized texts and colors as this helps users in generating their brand colors and text  incognito mode for preventing unwanted contacts from viewing wether you are active or not  there should also be a widget to download texts from status,positive
from the last app update whatsapp notifications and notification sound are not at all poping up i have to open the application to see the new messages and also there is no alert for them this is a serious problem as from past  to  days this has started and since then there is no update pushed from whatsapp i request you to please resolve this issue soon,negative
it is better the app stick to just texts video calls are the worst constantly reconnecting even when there is no signal issue in the area potential is present but it is up to you guys to improve,negative
it was fine and worked really well until the latest update now it is horrible to use bluetooth connections barely work and video call is impossible you are better off using other apps at this point,negative
they disabled the feature when you could play multiple voice messages in a row this is dangerous when you have to listen messages while driving a car now you have to touch your phone to play every message and you could end up in an accident smh,negative
all over app is good but i would like you to fix the live location issue the live location stops updating when the phone is locked it should be continuously updating the location even if the phone is locked or the app is closed it will be a really great update i do not know if you read the reviews and actually take those suggestions if you really read my review whatsapp then do reply to it here,negative
i cannot even access the app now the past two days i have woken up to the opening screen with no progress past that ive reinstalled cleared cache it will work for a few hours after reinstall than nothing again started on wednesday night,negative
this app constantly pauses or stops audio messages when i exit app and switch to another extremely annoying it should continue to play audio messages regardless of whether i switch to another app or not but continuously pausing messages every  seconds is infuriating,negative
no idea what is happened to whatsapp but now it does not show my photos to send it only shows media i share with other contacts it is incredibly annoying when this my primary app for contact tempted to swap to something else if this is not fixed,negative
this app is very good and there are a lot of things to like about this app but i am not going to talk about those i will talk about the things that can be improved and one big feature  it would be awesome if there were avatars you can keep  i think you guys can add some animated emojis of ourself that can use the front camera of the phone  there can be a feature like you can send status to only some particular contacts i hope these can be added quickly to whatsapp,positive
if there was a zero i would put it cannot change contact name pictures took on the app is so trash loading is very slow even with good internet not getting all messages for notif always lagging better with telegram so trash whatsapp unless you change it base on my review which i think you will not since you people making this app is so useless,negative
the microphone for voice recording is not working i noticed that after recording and sending there is nothing to show for that because the microphone could not capture my voice please fix this and maybe i will add more stars i already updated my whatsapp too,negative
after recent update i am facing following issues   my dp is not visible to my contacts  i am not able to send many files even if the nuber of files is less than  a message is displayed that cant send more than  files solve the issue at the earliest,negative
my experience so far using the app has been amazing but i would like to make a suggestion please make provision whereby one is able to block an individual in a group chat create an option where if one opens an individuals profile in a group chat the block option will also be listed if the command is set both parties will not be able to see each others comments or posts in a group chat even if they respond to other peoples comments in same group thanks,positive
great app but i suggest to add some features  if i see someones status first and they send it to me via whatsapp then the media does not come to the gallery plz fix this  advanced privacy in showing the profile pic ie the person whom i want to include or exclude from contacts,positive
the app is very good and help full app everyone can see is your google account dp status and your available information everyone can voice call video call massage voice message and send upi and money send receive photos send receive the app is most useful app this app can is group study discussion etc,positive
ever since the update i can only send media that was previously downloaded via whatsapp only any media content and etc is not showing when i want to attach a particular media the one showing available to attach is obly content that was shared via whatsapp before eg screenshot is not showing as an available attachement i have to go through gallery and select sharw via whatsapp,negative
phones media not recognized after the latest update you should fix that or at least tell us where we can fix that it is very invovenient to go each time to the gallery to send an image instead of accessing it directly from whatsapp this change should be mentioned in the update description i would not update it if i saw this change,negative
i am highly disappointed for the inconvenience in muting multiple contacts at once which was available with previous version but i found missing with this latest version now i have to mute one by one which takes a lot of time ,negative
om whatsapp i am not able to send videos to anyone i tried several times deleting and reinstalling the app to check for updates still it is the same problem i talk to support and they were also not able to help me it is awful and the worst experience,negative
your problem is making this app unusable when out of date some marginalized people like us will not be able to update it instantly as soon as you release a new version allow it to work and notify users of the new update they can update if they like the new features some people are just here for text audio and video calling and not worried about who last did what where,negative
this is a very simple and easy to use app with recent and relevant updates however kindly consider giving group admins the capacity to create a broadcast list out of groups i think the recent feature only supports creating a community this is necessary because some group members pay swift attention to direct messages compared to group charts as well group charts are most likely to be flooded with irrelevant messages and thus some group members miss out on relevant information etc,positive
i love the creativity and innovation of the app it would really be nice if the archives can not be at the top of the chats page we archive chats for a reason if you know what i mean they can appear in the settings as a goto option thanks in anticipation,positive
worked fine until the last update and now it will not let me share photos from my gallery only shows all the images that have already been sent through the app in different threads cannot send multiple photos and will not let me send videos at all absolute shambles,negative
i do not know why and how but i cannot send picturesvideosaudios anymore because of the new update maybe it is because of my phone but this happened when i updated the app please fix this immediately i want to share picturesvideosaudios to my friends and family again,negative
i have noticed a problem on whatsapp whenever i share a photo from my gallery on whatsapp status it is displaying that the photo does not exist in my internal storage but when i check internal storage then i can see the photo please try to fix this issue as soon as possible i think it is happening because of some bug thanks in advance,negative
good app but i could suggest some appchanging features  we should be able to see others messages informations and not just ours  it is so annoying when you chat with someone and then automatically the next day all messages selfdestroy can you please fix that that is all thank you for your care,positive
the whatsapp service is very sound and clear to the extent of the voice call is also very clear with out cracking so the network very fantastic and serve as fast in browsing and gives excellent service  the voice call sounds also very clear and the video call also have a service and give neat  only the voice call at times hangout without hearing the opposite well thanks,positive
used to work now bluetooth connection broken i have followed all the online advice and the permissions for nearby devices are not asked for everything otherwise works fine so i suspect it is not asking for a permission it needs or not updated for the latest os,negative
horrible experience when switching from one phone to another lost all the chats and some contacts why make this transit from old phone to new one such a trouble you should learn from telegram where everything works smooth and fast with no need to do back up or anything at all,positive
after update i can only select images from what has been sent on this app if i want to send something that has not i need to navigate to my photo album and from there i can send only one at a time further more i am unable to send videos this way as well what kind of lame update is this ,negative
updates fail all the time and it takes too much time i play voice messages but can barely hear them my screen goes black and when i unlock it it freezes until the end of message,negative
it is been all whacky recently when i scroll up it skips to mf  messages when someone sends a video i cannot watch it because its frozen to the first frame and will not start playing and messages sometimes take forever to send sometimes just dont,negative
love the app it awesome but i just have one problem that i think need urgent attention there is no media setting for video quality there is only one for photos and its really annoying when you post a video and the quality get reduced unlike other sociah media appshope its gets fix with the next update,positive
if anyone is sending me some photos it automatically gets deleted the same is happening with me in messages as well if someone is sending me a message then those messages are getting deleted automatically this is happening ever since i updated whatsapp please tell me some solution for this overall it is a good app but since the new update has come there is a lot of trouble this should be resolved as soon as possible,negative
it is an exceptional app since it makes messaging cup of tea for everyone the only little problems that i have are as follows   before the latest update it was hanging and bugging when i type something after an emoji the keyboard would just freeze  please improve the photo system i am glad you are so friendly and obedient with your audience and the new updates are what the public demanded so good job ,positive
idk why it did always worked on galaxy note  with no problemnow on galaxy s ultra it is having a lots of issuesnot able to send video files anymore wth  tech support has no idea what is going on  fail to process video  please try again later or restart your phone that is what i am getting probably for  months now  restarting phone does not help those new updates does not help either recently got several updates but still does not work i do not know what is going on,negative
its fantastic  the features and all other stuffs goes well  i should say too good but i thing something needs to be added  as we can turn off the last seen  we should have a option to turn off the online  offline mode seen by others of ours  not only i but many other want this thats it nothing else,positive
what do you developers do while sending any photo its quality gets reduced significantly even when the quality is set to best please please please give some heed to this comment and kindly add an option to send photos in their exact original quality,negative

in the recent  update i have observed the some issue with the app these are few pointers when i am on whatsapp call i will be unable to play hotstar and amazon prime videos or other ott platforms except youtube  when i am on whatsapp call and then i call through my phones dialer then i will not be able hear the voice of another party and when i resume the whatsapp call it override on dialer and make the direct call on hold so now i think there is really something wrong in the app,positive
whenever i sent a voice message it does not show those wavy things on the voice message and it also have some delays when i press the voice button to record a voice message it is so annoying i reallyreally hope that the developer would take this issue seriously and put out an update to slove this issue,negative
all is good but major problem is when we upload status or share a video clips of mobile camera recorded that might losing an original recorded clarity when we have use to share or upload a status that is an issue for all of us please fix them as soon as possible,negative
i love the app so much but i will like it if you could add more status fonts emojis and status background colour and maybe the background could be mixed with some things and not just plain background and make it possible to join photos and for security pin passwords and pattern should be enabled also create more wallpaper themes for whatsapp thanks,positive
usually in the status privacy i could only share with nobody as in not picking a contact at all and i think that was a wonderful thing until the newest update apparently it forces me to pick a contact and if i dont choose it will use the previous contact list why are you forcing me to share my private status to people i am literally a minor atleast make a nobody feature for the status privacy,positive
slowly but added new features but if i compare with other chat application then whatsapp is under in midrange level some feature that should be in it  exceed video file size mbnot mention document file  added privacy to show profile picture only show not to my contact except  added airplane mode to swith off whatsapp,positive
it is free fortunately people in my region the entire mobile phone users have this messenger app installed and used as first choice communication tool even as compared to phone app all features in the app work great and very helpful simple and complete,positive
uploading photos has been difficult i cannot open up my normal gallery with phone only folders if i took photos or screenshot something recently and want to send to someone it end up showing folders of people name who i spoken to on whatsapp this newer update made it difficult now,negative

for people who can no longer access their photosgo into permissions in the settings scroll down to not allowed and change your camera and photo settings i have not been able to send them since the update but this seems to have fixed it,negative
there are many glitches with backup and restoration process and i lost my huge and important data and there was no proper response from whatsapp the process of generate password is also not reliable you can lose your data there as well best to have minimum features with proper stability and testing of it,negative
status review feature is very annoying when we click on reply to really reply or to pause a status it often mistakenly clicks on the quick emoji reactions instead do this when we click on an qick reaction emoji do not directly send it put it in the reply section and then once sure we can manually click send button to send it,negative
right now i am not able to send any message to any one this situation started after  pm of today all the other apps are running freely except whatsapp latest update have transferred archive from down to up which is quite unhealthy because any one can open it from up so if developers can provide a choice for users where they want to keep archive it would be beneficial for us apart from that they can give us private mode too where we can put important chate safe,positive
not good on pixel  pro the camera button in whatsapp does not take as clear pictures as the camera is capable of taking particularly on the front facing camera which does not have a focus function at all in whatsapp but also on the rear facing camera it is far better to take photos in the camera app then click share and go to whatsapp that way,positive
whatsapp is good and convenient communication app but some features are missing i request you to add notification bubble feature for better and easy reply and secondly whatsapp upload only  seconds video in status please upgrade the time limit,positive
the autocorrect has become ridiculous when did you decide that you should change the word even if its spelt correctly i cannot physically count the amount of times i have written i love you with no typos and whatsapp changes it to i live you and that is just  example do you think i do not have the mental capacity to type the word i want if there is a mistake in the word then autocorrect is useful but dont change the word if theres no mistake whoever came up with that idea should be fired,positive
this application has problems it is not possible that messages in a group chat were delivered to me almost  hours later just because someone wrote me in private while i have been online various times during those  hours fix this issue i am a student on stage and i missed one day because of you i use this app almost everyday because people use it as the main chat app and do not even know what sms are anymore so in my case it is important that whatsapp notifies me immediately thanks,negative
the clarity of the pictures reduce somehow when sent through whatsapp picture quality remains same only if pictures are converted to pdf but this process is not know to everyone it would be good if this problem is fixed,positive
why have you changed the image selection flow now it is close to impossible to attach photos captured from the camera attach  gallery is the flow i am referring once gallery opens all media only shows media present in whatsapp instead of showing all the captured photos,negative
it is my favorite way of communicating with family and friends it is free quick and easycalls may fail sometimes but understandably so due to the fact that millions of people are using the app at the same timebesides that it is effortless,positive
most annoying thing about this app is the function that allowes people to add you to groups without your consent you can leave the group ofcourse but than u get into socially awkward conversation as to why you left you can block the group but than you still see messages piling up i mean there has to be a way to make a function that asks if you want to join a group or not or just get rid of groups all togethe,positive
do not like that it changes my parameters settings when i update plus seems to use a lot of mgb to do so even though it only takes secs  min to do so i have lost contacts  other critical information when i have updated previously,negative

overall the app is fantastic everything is good but there is a need of one more thing in this app the thing is there should be an apk file send option in files sending option when we send image audio or location etc there should be one more option of applications apk file,positive

when i am on a video call buttons does not work after minimizing the screen and comming back to full screen mode this should be fixed  there should be a remove option to remove participant as sometime if i am talking with my grand parents they do not know how to disconnect the call so every time to remove them we all have to disconnect the call and reconnect so you should add a remove participant option so we need not to disconnect it overall features are good,positive
why am i not getting notifications when i get messages i turned the option on in the app settings but still nothing only way i know if i have a message is if i constantly monitor the app it is very frustrating,negative

i wrote this review below months ago only one complaint has been rectifiedthat messages can be deleted after more than  hour cannot edit cannot delete after  hr cannot delete individuals messages sent via broadcast telegram has all these advantages and more that is why telegram is becoming more popular,negative
it is a great app for exchanging our thoughts ideas and memories but you can add an textmessage edit feature so that it helps to understand the content because some times we may miss any word or sentance in the text which might look unrealistic or unreadable at the receiver end i request development team to make this change,positive
after recent update i am unable to take ot make audio and video calls as screen gets stuck on connecting but never connects though on wifi it works perfect,positive
i have only one suggestion hope it will be considered i want whatsapp to enable deletion and editing of messages sent without time restrictions and without notifying the receiver about it we are all humans we make mistakes sometimes you would send a detrimental insulting derogetory or an erroneous message that you would regret a fraction of second after hitting the sent button if implemented it will go along way in improving relationships businesses etc thank you,positive
very worst method in forget password for two step verification  it took mor then a week i hate this email method it will easy and helpful when you give other way of recovery password otherwise it is irritating to get after long time more than  days,negative
i have been temporarily banned  times in the past  hours and i have been in contact with the whatsapp support team which proved to be a futile exercise they told me my app version was unapproved from which i uninstalled and reinstalled the app  twice  yet the issue keeps persisting as i am typing this i have yet again been banned and no one is telling me how to fix this issue this is very inconvenient as i use whatsapp to communicate with my employer,negative
since the last update the camera turned off in the middle of the video call and i have to turn it on again and again during the video call also just like others complaining about the access to the gallery n stuff please fix this,negative
i want to report whatsapp a bug or whatever that once i send a reply of a status and if it is a video then the music starts playing in background i hope you will see this comment and work upon this else the animations in this latest version is awesome i just loved those,negative
recent whatsapp updates are totally waste of timeit can not update the contact with recent chatting orders if i delete some chat than beside going back to its actual time frame it show on the top of list,negative
an update should cause improvements not make things worse  star until they fix the photo issue that everyone is having or they could just keep this up while people switch to other platforms,negative
awesome app i cannot believe i have waited so long to download it i wish more family and friends used it so i could use it more often this app has a crisp  simple interface so userfriendly and a pleasure to navigate i recommend this app to everyone bestkept secret in the world of communication apps,positive
contacts are not arranged on the basis of date but actually arranged on the basis of active chat that is not convenient but in previous version is according to date so it is an issue if i delete some chat but their contact seen in recent actions plzz resolve it,negative
had a very good experience with this appbut after recent update chat history is not working properly as if someone deleted some chats ofa particular contact it does not goes down from screen as it was before but shows on the screen which is creating problemkindly set it as it was before,negative
as much as i love whatsappi was so disappointed to be blocked for hours citing that i was using an illegal versionwhich is not true i have been using whatsapp since it was launched with regular updates and changes when i moved to another country it suggested to go to the google store to get the correct version which is exactly where i am right now it raises suspicion about the controls that they have in place,positive
since last  updates  repeatedly ends with microphone error message  accesses microphone in the background when not on calls  the sounds cuts out repeatedly when on calls both voice and video mostly non functional,negative
i have not been able to post full length videos like i used to i am limited to  minute videos which results in me having to edit the videos and post in sections i may as well use the text app on my phone,negative
update  i have recently switched to another phone whatsapp is unable to restore messages from backup after  of restoring it crashes phone s ultra i have tried almost a hundred times the same problem persists,negative
this version of whatsapp is just useless immediately i play a voice note sent to me my phone light will turn off so it does not give me the opportunity to control or fast forward the voice note do something about it asap i do not really like this version at all thanks,negative
great app been using it for many years now not many complaints really other than the odd problem i have with the camera if i want to record a video with the flash i cant the flash just does not come on but it does for photos it is very annoying and another problem is sometimes when i want to shorten a video it does not work and just keeps playing from the original start and shutting down and reopening the app does not fix it other than that amazing app i use it on the daily basis ,negative
at this moment my whatsapp keeps on closing glitching and kicking me out i have deleted re  installed it and done every possible thing google said to do and it is not working i needed this to be sorted out like yesterday please assist me asap as i need it for university and work this is a major inconvenience,negative
when i receive a floating notification in whatsapp while watching a video in full screen the combination of translucency of the notification window together with black font make it incredibly hard to read the message yet the notification window still does a good job of obstructing a part of the video a much better job than of showing the message i would have tried to tweak the translucency the font color to achieve better results but there does not seem to be such an option ,negative
unfortunately the new update has added a glitch that has narrowed the space to view when searching for gifs to ridiculously small i tried to contact them on this but does not seem noone wants to know so downgraded it the app was suprisingly very easy to use and setup it is no wonder why it is so popular and is a great way to share photos and videos i will strongly recommend this and those who have not yet tried it to put aside their fears and give it a go there is no registration needed,positive
hi i have been using this since the beginning and the simplicity is the best feature now with so many updates and upgrade some just feel annoying  the reaction to the message it keep appearing on my notification window until i open the message when i send hundreds broadcast and they reply with reaction imagine that i have to reopen them one by one because i cannot mark them as read,negative
i have been using the app for a few years now normally whatever the bug was it was resolved pretty quickly within  days but exactly a week ago the contacts names on my whatsapp disappeared and were replaced by their numbers app is updated phone is updated and contacts are synced a little frustrating because i need to carefully check i am sending the correct messages to the intended party i hope this issue gets resolved soon thank you,negative
i think it would be perfect if i can access whatsapp on several or at least  gadgets it is a lil bit uncomfortable for me to switch from android to ios and vice versa since the interface looks so different maybe it will help a lot if i can access on both as i learn to understand and familiarize myself with the new device please consider this,positive
whatsapp is a good app for texting calling and finding people you can make group chats with lots of people and call multiple people at once even if two users have different types of phones pictures will still send clear,positive
it is not perfect i get that i have just been having issues with the voice notes and occasionally the call feature both have bombed out either when i start or halfway through i am hoping that a clean installation will hopefully resolve this issue for me update after patiently waiting whatsapp promising they are looking into the voice note recording issue and and then closing it i am disappointed to say  updates later and still the same result with no feedback on progress or cause,negative
overall the best messaging app i have ever used it is easy to use free and uses wifi to message when connected but i would like it if you could make it so that if you call someone but they do not answerdecline they could leave a reason why they did not answerdecline and you could leave a reason why you called and vice versa i would also like it if you could make status videos longer so like  min min  sec instead of  sec and you can send any type of video and it will not just say cannot send thx,positive
good messaging app the fact that you can choose more than around five reactions is pretty great what is still missing is the possibility to add more than one profile pic which would be amazing since the way i see it it is usually not easy to abandon an image you have had for let us say months even a maximum of  would be enough apart from that keep it up,positive
keeps crashing with a orgxmlpullvxmlpullparserexception error when i do a long press on picture sharing mode customer support is useless as i sent  emails sent screenshots explained that i already restarted my devicereinstalledupdated whatsapp and all they do is send some generic unhelpful replies says compatible android  and i have android  really a disgrace that you do not test your app properly on versions you state as supported not everyone can afford latest phone,negative
overall its a good app but when i am on call with my friends it always reconnects even tho my wifi is strong it is really annoying when we are trying to keep track when how long we called but whatapp just ruins that is by reconnecting when both ends wifi is strong and stable,positive
whatsapp was very a good app but you need to improve your features like add some options to create folder for chats in example me as student has many group for classes and we used whatsapp as our main platform to connect to each otherbut unfortunately when whatsapp does not have that kind of features it made my whatsapp app looked messy i hope that you can improve your features just like telegram as well tq,positive
until today whatsapp has been brilliant but then my phone updated and whatsapp is not working for me any more i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling checked all my permissions etc same thing happened to a friend recently what is going on  i need the app to keep in touch with family across the planet any suggestions,positive
overall it is a perfect messenger but after android  update fonts are not getting bold even after its bold enabled in settings please resolve it as soon as possible,negative
i feel very bad experience because after update one major problem i am facing with is about the tick issue before it was okh but now when the alternative person seen the message sent by me after that also showing single tick similarly when the person is online the send message was also showing single tick rather then double i think it was the most annoying thing  please  fix this issue,negative
u come wth diffrent updates but nothing sooo diffrent n what is the use if there is no option of exit or leave or who can send or add us to broadcast listu shud come up wth these options on broadcast too as group options n featuresthere is no option we can remove ourselves if other person has added on their broadcastsooo many updates but this is as is itand that green circle around profile picture is not showing,positive
i feel it would be better if whatsapp added this to their next update which is while listening to music on a bluetooth device and when opening whatsapp status at the same time videos should not interrupt the music playing unless you want to listen to the sound of the video then you click any of the volume buttons to listen to video sound or an option should be provided after clicking the three dots at the top right of the screen while viewing whatsapp status to unmute the videos sound,negative
your recent update enables users to see status by clicking on profile picture from chats but when i clicked on a profile picture then reclicked it to see it then i was thrown to that contacts status happen with contacts that have posted a status,negative
i love the app it is good but it would be really greater if a chat could be created for saved messages as we on telegram where one can save info recording and messages to be sent later and not immediately,positive
whatsapp is a nice application i am enjoying your free services please the recent update that changed the position of the  icons on the status page to the top right corner is not ideal for mobile devices stretching up there to select the desired theme of status is not necessary thank you,positive
with the last update they made unnecessarili complicated the image sharing the phone gallery is somewhat hidden requiring more steps to access it plus it is not possible to share more than  image at once,negative
ever since the latest update it repeatedly crashes does not allow me to send voice messages anymore and keeps saying storage full when it is not even close,negative
very helpful nice powerful app for chatting and sharing data but nowadays there is a big in whatsapp as follows  if we are viewing any video on status and then go to home suddenly then the audio is still playing behind,positive
return whatsapp features as before now i find it difficult to post recent videos  photos that taken from outside whatsapp please bring this feature back the current feature is very troublesome and annoying please return it or we will change it to telegram,negative
it used to be simple and efficient since not everyone is tech savvy however like everything facebook gets their paws into turns to garbage fast constant updates that do not make it easier or fix things just for changes,negative
it does not workit used to but now it does not i tried to download it more than  times today but still it does not work and it does not allow me to download a new one or send iti tried to find the problem but it seems like there is no problem with it and for sure the problem is not my phone too cause it is brand new it does not have any difficulties with other apps,negative
it was working perfectly on my samsung now it change and for some reason when i go to send pictures now it does not show all the pictures like before its becoming super annoying now i have to go to the gallery to send pictures one by one why did it change please change it back,negative
app can be more efficient if an email is attached with it for recoveryin case if we lost the number we can access to whatsapp through email also one more feature can be added that is message request if any unknown person send us message it should have an option to check the message without the sender knowing,negative
i have noticed after the most recent app the camera on video calls switches from portrait to landscape mode for the person i am talking to and zooms in an extreme amount,positive
thanks for the app very useful and efficient i would like to suggest a feature that i would really like to see and i think would be very useful can you make a way to mention all members of a group at once something like   that would be time saving instead of mentioning all names thanks for your consideration,positive
all good but when you send a video or photo on status it got blur which is a severe issuekindly it is a humble request to whatsapp as soon as possible resolve this issue also react option to whatsapp status cux most of times we are not in mood to reply on whatsapp status but we have to show that yournd person status matter to us,positive
love whatsapp have been using it since it started although i did not come here to actually review though i came here to ask if something is possible a schedule send option for whatsapp do not know if it makes sense for a lot of people but i think people using whatsapp for work an update like this might come in handy rather than remembering to send something in the morning why not schedule it off in the night please do tell me if it is possible or even if it is not thankyou,positive
i do not know why but it seems like every time i fix it so that i can get my sound notices it is goes back to its old way and i cannot get my notices for my when i get a text frommy friend this is very upsetting because i do not want to have to constantly keep an eye on the phone just to get a notice for my friend when i hear from him i really hope this issue can be resolved now it is done it again so i got to figure out why it keeps changing and stopping,negative

well i believe there is something wrong after recent update whatsapp has temporarily banned my account for no reason two times since yesterday people might have something important going on and all of a sudden getting banned and waiting for an hour with no option to open it is just annoying slowly moving my communications to telegram,negative
very good app which makes one communicate with friends and loved ones through videos images etc the only shortfall is its upgrade which disallows some handsets to have access to the app to operatewith ease,positive
whatsapp is not  safe and it does share your data and read personal databased on your data it also sends you unneccessary advts and offersthe msges are not end encrypted as stated by them you can find it out from the advts and msges you get after your conversations all policies are one sided and one has to either agree to them or simply not use the app,positive
messaging is fine features are alright but jesus mary and joseph and the wee donkey taking a picture is awful both on my old oneplus t and my current pixel  pro the images have the worst output my friend sent me a picture of white chocolate on a pixel  pro and it came out pink  i regularly close the app take whatever picture i needwant in the native camera app for far superior results and then share in whatsapp  try harder,negative
of the major messaging apps whatsapp is probably the most reliable feature packed and widely used meaning most of your contacts likely already use it if i have any gripes about whatsapp it is that i wish it had more backup options with different cloud services other than google drive on android and icloud on iphone,positive

suggestion as of now status video length can be  seconds and if user want to keep longer length video on status then it needs to crop video for  sec again and again so whatsapp should add feature like once user choses longer length video it should allow to select from and to more than  seconds and automatically there should be split into  second chunks may be the case like same feature is available but i am not aware of it sorry if already present star for attention only else star,negative

agree with all the people complaining about the new way of attaching pictures having to click the  dots finding gallery and the whole  yards is so time consuming who at meta thought that people just want to see the media that is in whatsapp already if is not broken do not fix it one star until you revert the brilliant idea,positive

the new update is not what expected it become worst if we delete any unwanted message in a chat or group chat it does not organise accordingly to date and time received it will remain as the time and date for that deleted message appear on top of the chat list can be one we last received few week ago by delete in latest incoming message please sort it out very annoying ,negative
i was really pleased with whatsapp until the recent update arrived i mean whatsapp already had three separate spaces for chats status and calls so then why are you interlinking between chats  status and making us see all the status whenever we want to see a persons dp and not even letting us zoom it to see properly we will see the status of our friends when we want why are you forcing us this last update is really ridiculous  frustrating,negative

it is a nice app for messaging and stuff it has perfected messaging as we know it they should add a search feature so we can search for those who check my status instead of scrolling to look for names,positive
can we have a sketch pad feature so we can draw a quick diagramdrawing on a canvas to send to the chat chat  paperclip  sketch then some basic tools and colours and a blank canvas half the screen,negative
the latest update is shnot able to select multiple photos in one go to share from galleryhave to go through the three dots to switch to camera gallery everytime and select a single photo and repeat the process again and again till i reach  pics limit,negative
samsung update means you have to physically go into gallery to share photos whereas last week you could attach them from inside whatsapp itself it still works for videos just not pics really annoying,negative

havving issues with my samsung s ultra difficult to access my phones gallery as whatsapp prioritises its own image folders i also cannot select multiple images to share please fix these bugs,negative
after recent updates bugs are found in the app while video calling the app not responding properlyits getting stuck and eventually getting closed also the additional feature of pic blur in chat section is irritating please give option to modify according to user conviencerest everything is fine love this app,negative
not bad could use more parts like added options for maps the site is made for those who are basically looking for a mate for one reason or other and to have a two way gps would be a nice addition,positive
i love wa but lately i would dare say already months i do not get any notifications unless i am right in the app calls are simply not ringing and often noticed after couple of hours like a missed call notifications it is very very inconvenient and i would vote for some fixing before i will be forced to swap my favourite chatting and calling tool thanks for taking into consideration,positive
pretty nice but i would like the developers to enable the delete functions for admins to delete messages that are not needful in a group chats from other members view to avoid group interruption thanks plz you guys have done a good job also the developers should include online notifier for all contacts not necessarily when you open one chat page before you can see if a person is online or not but once you open your whatsapp page it should notify like fb messenger does thank you,positive
thanks for developing this app we completely rely on this app for communication but it would be better if u consider a few things a feature that does not bring the archived chat up on the top whenever a new mssg arrives from that chat also please add a feature to tag people on whatsapp status  strikethrough feature for about,positive
good experience overall but whenever i receive messages from multiple users the app icon disappears until i lock my phone screen this only happens with whatsapp,negative
respected developer i am very benefited by downloading this app of yours but i want you to increase the privacy of this app a bit more my humble request you arrange separate pin for each contact in next update i am having a hard time not having this feature i hope you see this issue please ,positive
i am using this app since very long but i am facing this problem for the very first time it is not opening it is is showing that whatsapp have bug and update when developer fixes that i do not know why it is happening i have reinstalled app but then also problem remains same showing that it has some bug,negative
have been my first choice of text msg apps but recently constantly running in the background for backup and draining the battery despite amending the setting not sure why hopefully will not be like this after latest update,negative
i like to use this app it is very helpful to make friends all over the world and i also use whatsapp for work as well but the only one thing need to be update online status sometimes when i am not online my friend says that i am online please work on that thankyou but still overall this app is the best,positive
i logged out my whatsapp and now i cannot log in my whatsappit strucks in initailizing partwhile i gave my name and setting my profile the initializing starts and it shows unable to connect please try again and shows two options cancel and check status while i check status it gives a message like whatsapp working normallyplease make sure of this problem,negative
can you believe this still cant be used on an ipad maybe need to jailbreak but need cross platform this app is not practical what a backward thinking app when is this app going to work properly across the different platforms i fear the third party apps are a security issue but no one has any choice if you think this app and its chat platform is secure maybe its time to think again because lots of people now use third party apps to access this platform a disgrace entirely,positive
the worst app ever created but has many users around the world the security is very critical fa is not fully secure they claimed secure it is just a deception note never use the onetimeused number for this service or you say goodbye to it almost every single day,negative
i like this app but i feel disappointed when i try to insert my sim to another phone and this app seems to be fussy when it keeps verifying the number or the phone unit sometimes i need to wait  hours and even more to verify my existing number in that new phone means i missed out of using whatsapp for long hours,negative
pathetic idk why whatsapp has become so worst earlier we were able to easily restore backed up chat and media  now i just uninstalled the app and reinstalled and only chat is getting restored even though when i had done all the types of backup local and cloud and for an email only automated responses are coming through never expected i have been using whatsapp from more than decade never faced this issue,negative
every app has pros and consthat does not mean it is not beneficial for uswe should be more focused on advantages rather than negative aspectsso thanks for making something newnot really perfect but obviously unique,positive
please remove invite a friend list from below the friends list it is a waste off time because if a person wants to or does use whatsapp then as soon as i enter their details they will turn up on my whatsapp friends list i think your just scratching around for features to keep people using this app when it is reliability is failing its users never should have been given to greedy zuckerberg  also please remove businesses from discover section in select contact page complete waste ,negative
new update is extremely bad whenever update status in case of text words typing it becomes short why we have full screen  if the size becomes too small ,negative
would be a much better app if export chat feature worked like telegramif one could transfer data and chat history from one whatsapp account to another or one chat to other easily such that old and new chat messages are arranged according to time of posting not in text file format add option to move selected chats from one account to other notifying only those contacts the change in account number,positive
i had a high rating until i updated whats app and it asked for my passcode i on pressed i forgot pass code no code was sent to email or messenge box a page come up next to go to chathow can you go to chat when you cannot get in to the app i had no alternative to but skip resture and loose all data just to get inthe app all because i was unable retrieve passcode  no support they just repeated what i told them i could not doi got a person from computer sciences they could not follow,negative
its good and great but u need to enhance a video zooming feature where by a person can zoom in video while watching it like in telegram and please make it possible for people to be mentioningtagging their friends at their statusstory section it would help alot for those friends to realize and notice the statuses made for them to react on time thank you,positive
day by day this whatsapp is improving and has been installed almost by everyone one thing i want to notify to developers is please bring a feature where we can automatically block similar pattern of numbers automatically or scam calls or texts i have become fed up from getting these fake text and calls if this feature will be premium i would pay for it to get activated thanks,negative
my experience has on the app has been worthwhile and i love it i hope to keep loving it the only problem with the app is that it needs to maintain quality of pictures and videos after it has been sent ,positive
nice till recent update reason below whatsapp is one to one messaging app whoever contact is saved in ur device will be able to contact you there is no point of removing online status symbol from whatsapp it is not facebook where anyone can message you by name even if you want not to be contacted just delete that person contact simple it is only female dominated feature,positive
very bad experience even if i delete the contacts but still it shows on whatsapp and nothing can be done i have refreshed installed unistalled and everything but nothing works please do see to this issue,negative
as a messenger it is good but the whatsapp payment is awfully buggy one of my friends sent me a link for setting up whatsapp payment  in the last  hours i have received more than  automatic reminders for the same even after setting up whatsapp payment  sending  receiving money i am getting continues reminders for setting up whatsapp payment,negative
i have been using this app for  years now the app is great but i recently switched phones and every time i am trying to download the app it continuously says pending it does not download it has been pending for a week now,negative
the recent update does not allow you to find recent photos only showing photos in your whatsapp folder this needs to be reverted back to the original set up,negative
i love this app it helps a lot nothing is bugging no ads it is very good you can join a group call we will only if you have there number video call so you can see how familyfriends over years or for no reason at all it great i love i contact my friend and i use it everyday well not everyday but i recommend you to download that app cuz it amazing,positive
good alternative for messages so you can chat cross platform with read receipts stickers and actually somewhat decent quality video some changes would be suggested though most important feature missing cannot be singed in on two phones or a phone and tablet at once unlike message also could better image and video quality shared,negative
with this app  distance chatting is much better but i do not know why the simplicity of this app is disappearing with the latest version and its new feature things are now a way more difficult than before lastly i tried to send more than  pictures to a contactbut each time i tried it was to no avail meanwhile in the past i did not face this challenge i am really disappointed though i like rhus app very much,positive
very convenient to send text pic video to anyone and anywhere in the world at anytime have connected with friends relatives and acquaintances have used it for office work too,positive
gmail do not give notification for my mails even after the all notification settings of gmail app and system settings are on also my mails also not quickly visible to me unless i refresh it  times this problem is faced not only by me but also hundreds of my friends please take this review seriously and do some real action on it as well as optimization of app instead of giving dump replies like follow blah blah site and follow that faq steps to solve your problem,negative
the only flaw that kept me one star away is the lack of features and optimisations in camera settings auto focus does not work properly quality often gets worse camera in whatsapp is need to be upgraded,negative
i hate this new interface to send pictures or videos how do you revert to the old way it is impossible to find screenshots using this new method and it also feels more difficult to find what you are looking for,negative
very good app for recieving videos sending videos video chat text call etc been using for about six months and i have had no issues or complaints definitely worth the download,positive
the long press on the app icon shows the most frequently contacted details i do not like this feature and i learnt this feature cannot be disabled as of now i hope they change it,negative
i want to give u some suggestions  you guys just got a new poll feature out similarly you can also add new feature like a reminder as in big companies the employees have to be reminded again and again an alarm should be set in the group so that this work does not happen again and again same type as the alarm works if you are interested in my suggestions then i can explain to you in full details,positive
latest version and before that version of the what is up working very worst too much hang problem in the video and audio call there is no proper response from the support team as well,negative
wonderful just wonderful i love all these new features they are too exceptional keep it up guys though i think there should be one minor change i think you should be able to at least see how many people have viewed your status even though you turned off the read receipts please if you could try to do something on this i would really appreciate ,positive
the latest update has unmuted the group chats even after setting it on mute the notification rings please fix it as it destroys the very purpose of providing a muting option,negative
hii using this app to connect with everyone i need i like the features in this app this app is also develop better time to time but i do not like green a bit can you make a feature so that this application can change colors according to what each user wants thank you ,positive

recently i am getting temporary banned unnecessarily saying that i use unofficial version i have been using the official version of whatsapp since day  and have not done any scraping or third party stuff using whatsapp account it is very annoying to just get banned for literally no reason and i am not getting any support so that atleast i can know what is wrong,negative
first suggestion the icon that appears in the whatsapp community does not see the photo outside you should update it and see the photo because most of the community groups have been formed without photo confusion the second suggestion is that along with being a group add in the whatsapp community it should also be added to the broadcast list,positive
what happened i used to enjoy using this app as my primary messenger app but now i am no longer am able to send more than one picture at a time and its a pain to even access my gallery from the app horrible i will be changing to a different app now because sharing pictures was essential for me,negative
worst app ever published on play store like i was on call with my friend in uk and more than half of the tym call was reconnecting even we both had super stable networks snapchat is far better than whatsapp even if someone ran out of data  snapchat calls are smooth even on kbps  i have one good tip for whatsapp shutdown your servers and take a leave and enjoy for lifetime bcuz all features are copied from different apps  and atlast do not forget about your father telegram,positive
is not clear where my data is stored does not provide a history log of past logins lost half of my chat history when moving to a new phone do not recommend jami or tox work so much better and more reliable,negative
i think the whatsapp community has to improvise the audio function on the latest version of itcause in some devices this function does not work so kindly requesting to remove the bugs and launch a new updateand please launch a new feature of end to end encryption password reset link cause from when i have updated the latest version then i could not access my backup from google drive cause i forgot my password and now whatsapp is not running as well as before so take my concern seriously,negative
since i had a recent update the replacement whatsapp keyboard has changed and there is no carriage return you cannot have paragraphs any longer like what i am doing what are the developers thinking derrrrrr put back the original authentic qwerty keyboard with a carriage return as opposed to this rediculas new send button replacing the carriage return it is now a send button how many send buttons does it need to have one not two it is a zero star for me,negative
i hate the new feature community i thought it was used for sorting the group chats and suddenly one of the groups members asked me why did i make a new group it was not for sorting my messy group chats  i do not think community is the right update for this time it is better for whatsapp to make an update to separate the group chats and personal chats in  different menus to make it seems more neat,positive
it is frustating how it keeps crashing and states there bugs and need to be updated yet it has been almost a week still no sign of the bug fixed could not open the app at all nor even to read the coming message,negative
posted  march  it would be better if there is any option for recovering the delete for me message because some people would accidentally delete a message only for them the message that they have thought to delete for everyone  edit  thanks whatsapp for updating this feature ,positive
works good for communication it has a neat camera feature i use it on a least weekly basis i thought their messenger pigeon commercial was stupid all that nonsense just to prove a point about whatsapp also who is going to see the letter held by a bird flying so fast you would see the paper just for split second,negative
photos from my gallery do not appear on dual messenger whatsapp anymore only those sent through whatsapp is visible it still appears on my main whatsapp app but not in the dual messenger one i need to go into my gallery to select photos now instead of doing it through the app very tedious might be a bug,negative
i will give you  stars if you can tell me how to stop this from automatically reloading back up after i forced closed it without touching it myself i am using a moto g it keeps restarting back up in the background when i do not want it actively running,negative
give me option to hide my phone number and give ability to choose username instead of mobile numberi do not like people have my phone number and i only like username without showing my phone number to othersthe biggest reason why use telegram is this it is ridiculous to show phone number and everyone can contact you if they save your phone number  it is annoying please bring ability to hide phone number for all people and when turn on that people saved our number do not be able to send message,negative
do not use this app now a bug issue persists you cannot see your friends profile photo last seen  about all even heshe kept her privacy open to all even heshe cannot see your status also fix this otherwise this app is useless sorry whatsapp team you cannot destroy someones privacy by your own,negative
i have faces issues that is during video call on whatsapp speaker turn to be automatically on and volume buttons not working fine and during video call sound is too loud i hope you will fix it very soon or next update asap,negative

very slow at windows many feature is disabled like multi select message to forward favorite sticker and very very very slowwwww at laptop a bit slow at android,negative
hi i love whatsapp and it helps me a lot i mainly just want to suggest an update where we can edit messages so it would be easier to correct something if we made a mistake instead of deleting theessage or rewriting it,positive
absolutely the worst  most useless programming known to man how can whatsapp web be so damned useless  for unknown reasons it produces a qr code on occasions but usually never if you lose webpage have to do it all again it may work in a browser one time then never again how can anyone design such trash and put it out to the public  appalled that such a useful thing could be made totally unusable,negative
kindly work of having the whatsapp data to be stored in the cloud instead of on the phone it is been frustrating for the past few months now even after buying a phone of higher gig ram uploading whatsapp status hangs for so long and slows down phone operation,negative
works fine but take up too much space in my storage i am really concern about my privacy since i have been talking to my friends about certain things and all of the sudden my ads are all about it also the data takes too much storage space,positive
whatsapps service is very bad back up crow everything is not backed up everything flies from above all chats all contacts all documents what kind of system is this absolutely rubbish and my everything removed so important things documents files all chats all important things i am very much disappointed from whatsapp team  how can it happens what kind of system i really really disappointed with your team and your system it is not fine anymore and never never,negative
for tha past one week whatsapp performance is poor video calls and photo sharing gets frozen often volume automatically goes down lots of bugs in the beta release,negative
the new update is great however the call link that was shared does not has an expiry to it which means anyone who shared the link and the one who received the link can join the call anytime solution i think could be we should add an expiry time to the link shared or as soon the call initiator disconnects or leaves the call the receipts should no longer have ability to join the call hope this helps and mark zuckerberg identifys my comment and appreciate in any form ,positive
i am unable to add new items in one of my collections in catalogue it always shows something went wrong what is wrong with the appthe security they talk about is useless last year i shared a yt video on the status and it was viewed by an intl number such is the case when the app gives us no option to make it public it was a uk based number  this app is giving us a free model to chat and instead we are being used as a product we are unaware of,positive
i am having this problem like always while uploading status the photo that should have been in the starting is always at the last as i upload it later because forgot about the photo so i would appreciate it if you add a feature to adjust the position of photos in the status after uploading the status,negative
last update changed the way gallery is displayed when you try to send pictures not all folders are shown as they use to camera screen shots dowbloads etc really anoying trying to find stuff in the gaery now,negative
first of all i would like to say whatsapp has been really awesome but over these past weeks i have been banned temporarily for what i cannot understand i checked it out and was told i was either scraping or i had downloaded my version from an illegal site which cannot be true cause i downloaded it right here as for scraping i do not even know what the word means now i just uninstalled and i am reinstallingplease check this out,negative
i just cant understand the peoples wich are complaining about this app its completely free and if it has any issue you can fix it with an update or reinstall of the app wich is also free best free platform for communication according to me,positive
i liked the chatcall and status button which you gave at the bottom of the screen can you add the option in which we can post something in writing also other than just pictures i made one group of my frnds in whatsapp today and the whatsapp showed three groups made with same name and people pls see the above problems and suggestions,positive
at st i rated  stars but now i do not wanna give a single star also because am having a lot of problems the main problem is i cannot download and send any media cannot see the status i have a good connection of internet and a good working android phone but the problem is with whats app i am here again after so many days but still facing the same problem my ig is working but what is app is not please fix it there are so many important things i cannot delete it please fix it mark zuckerberg,negative

i am a pc user i have used your web version and some of the issue i found i want to tell that in the pc web version we cannot add a new contact just like phone we do and after few days it automatically gets sign out so request you to release a complete pc version which will take phone number for verificationjust the mobile version because working in pc and operating from phone is a very hectic for us so please release full complete pc version instead of scanning qr to use it in pc pleaseseeasap,negative
for privacy reason i have set the camera and microphone permissions to be asked every time i need them whatsapp since to be stucked at android  or  since they redirect me to the system settings instead of using the permission ask api with the nice popup having the option allow for this time please upgrade that to the newest android standard since at least android ,negative
the app was great until it started like delay the message sending to the receiver it would like for min to  min to send it please solve this issue i would be great full it may be temporarily but i hope that the company may solve it,positive
a week ago it started putting white frames around people in video calls presumably when they are speaking however it is so sensitive that it picks up any slight noise with the result that these white frames are flashing on and off all the time it is annoying and uses up more battery life the only way to stop it is to turn off your mic please go back to having no frames since you can only have  people in a group chat it is not necessary,negative
this used to be a good app but these days it must update every second day new problem now is that i can receive voice message and i can record voice message but here is my problem that the other person cant listen to my voice message i am seriously think to delete this app and get something els to chat with so please help me so that i can send voice message again,negative

after this update when click on view votes in poll then whatsapp closes automatically and shows whatsapp has a bug is there any solution for this i cleared the cache files as it recommended and whatsapp is upto datebut these things doesnt work,negative
it is overall great application to chat with friends and family  but nowadays there are many scammers who message and harrass you with unknown numbers there must be an option to automatically block unknown numbers or a privacy setting where only your contacts can message you from a past couple of days i am being threatened by a guy  when i block him he messages me again using a different number it is all so annoying please add a feature so only our contacts can message ,positive
when i played an audio message sent by my friend my phones screen turned black and my did not worked for  minutes exact same duration as the audio message no this is not the problem with my device because i have experienced same happenstance in my other phone too this experience was certainly haunting i can give you  more stars if you can fix this problem or whatsapp can kiss uninstallation in my device,negative
facing an issue i am not able to delete contacts in whatsapp though they are not in phone contact followed everything but of no use roll out some feature to delete whatsapp contact directly,negative
backup in progress is stop half completely not going forward nearly hr also in same position previously version backup automatically completely fully so many errors backup process,negative
well amazing app but few amazing suggestions to make up for the remaining  stars it would have been great if more number of participants could get connected on a video call rather plan for a online whatsapp meet  try for something newlike a virtual display pictureeg inspite of static dp we could insert gifs or a short video into the dps,positive
i cannot send videos at all  keeps saying retry later or restart your device  it is so frustrating and when i want to send a picture on whatsapp it does not show in my gallery at all this new update is stupid,negative

the app is great it has become more exceptional after adding polls i believe it could become better if we could add polls to statuses so that family and friends can vote and raise opinions eg what color dress or what presents should i give my children i believe that this app can do it,positive
it used to be good but not anymore the call drops lags by few seconds and is not smooth group call is impossible update on dec  recently it complains that my account is temporarily banned because the app is downloaded from third party sources what a downfall,negative

good app counting on it daily but in the last couple of months i keep on missing calls and messages up to  for some reason the app its refreshing very slow,negative
send message without saving a number is more helpful if possible please change this specification for ex  i got one customer support service or any other business account whatsapp number without save the number we cannot send message copied that number or type the number in contact search box if search number is available whatsapp then we want to show the contact,negative
awesome app to talk to friends but it has a bit missing in groups admins should be allowed to delet message by other participants so they could delet those messages text photos etc containing bad material like porngraphy hacking or someones privacy  so this thing should be added thank you if you read my review thank you very much again,positive
backup issues it should be much easier to back up and restore chats and content when you get new devices it is so tedious and does not actually work well very frustrating,negative
whatsapp is cool just  step closer to great because whatsapp should allow us to edit our messages to change what we wish only if the person has not seen our message like for instance whatsapp made it possible for us to delete our message even though it was sent as long as the person did not see or get our message thank you,positive
i think there is a virus on the app my phone screen goes black when i am on call and it flashes black but takes a while to stop it also disconnects me from different games and stuff like that please check this out it only happens when i am on call,negative

it was fine before but after the update photos from my gallery is not visible anymore ein the apps when i want to send pictures i will need to share those picture through my gallery instead of just sharing it simply in chat,negative
i have been using this over two years actual i experienced an excellent service with this app but now it is like the worst i am getting banned like twice a day from like a week and i am sure i have not violated any of your terms and policies i am really frustrated right now with all this hope you will fix this as soon as possible,negative
the best and most convenient texting app there is it is fast and reliable an added bonus is the desktop app to access your messages from your computer super helpful,positive
i like the app but updates were not getting worse till date in the new update archived section shows on top i mean why a person would archive to keep the messages on top also when i forward an image to another contact it sends only the image and not its caption who would like to write caption again and again please improve the app otherwise my rating is  stars thank you,negative
after i downloaded the most recent update my whatsapp has been useless it is the th time my app is temporarily blocked today i have been using my whatsapp for messaging as i have been doing for many years now why this issue of temporary ban of a sudden can you help me figure out what exactly is wrong with my app or account,negative
alhamdulilah i am well satisfied with thisappit helped me to communicate with my friends family members here and abroad easilysoalso it is a very secured app keeping all my secrets invisible to otherslike fraudsters and so i would like to be thankful to the whatsapp team for providing such a good service and also understanding me and my needs at the required timeand also i being a marketing person helped me a lot in easie communications with the people here and also globally thank you,positive
autoupdated my whatsapp messenger my whatsapp was running on an international number but whatsapp provides no additional verification unless the code provided in the number via sms which means a lot of important business dealings were lost then i had to install whstsapp for my local number there should really be more than this onestep verificwtion for authenticating users,positive
hello whatsapp team  you are providing us very good and user friendly massenger thank you very much from the bottom of my heart i want to tell you that can we use audio file or audiovoice tags record features on our status   i mean mp or other formats of audio files on our daily whatsapp status that could be great for usor better and best features for us sometimes it is all it takes on some special moments  please ,positive
convert the quality of pictures to less resolution which we sharedirect as image as well poorer the quality of dp this problem is from long timesince i started using application so i request to work on this problem and come up with some sort of solution sharing image quality can be increased by sharing it as document but there is still problem with dp,positive
ridiculous update where we can no longer just send photos or videos quickly and easily have to go through  steps to do it stop fixing something that does not need fixing,negative
new update makes it extremely difficult to send picturesvideos impossible to navigate to the image video you have just saved to send,negative
this application is good and very useful but it is not completely trustworthy because one day someone else got the photo that my friend sent only to me i was shocked to see that photo in another group so other photo videos can also be leaked like this our chat video photos calls are not safe in this app and we are not safe and secure in this app please answer how the photo got leaked and give us privacy make our chat video photo video call call etc safe ensure that it will not leak,positive

whatsapp is one of the best messaging apps out there it is free to use there is no ads love it one thing i would suggest is add a button to clear all system generated messages like x added y to group x changed number to y etc these messages clog up chats and currently there is no way to get rid of them and also add a button to clear all unnedded messages such as messages which were deleted for everyone messages that contained media which cannot be downloaded anymore etc,positive

disappointed by whatsappmeta approach to possible hacked accounts by punishing the victims and permanently disable all their accounts rather than a warning or bringing it to their attention they have immediately disabled all my meta accounts without warning or any notice for reasons they are unable to share stating they received large number of complaints which must be  a result of a hackidentity theft as i have no reason whatsoever to receive such complaints,negative

no help available whatsoever when requesting call to verify account just hangs up immediately then suddenly you have to wait hours and hours to receive a verification sms and support responds in a few days absolutely terrible support system,negative

missed some group call thanks to the silent group call notification and for some reason it is easier to mistakenly forward a message due to frequently contacted and recent chats list on forward page being different than the actual list on chats althouh it could be avoided if you are not following your muscle memory and actually put some times to double check  but at least thay let us have the apl running on both pc and mobile simultaneously as a standalone app,positive

the app crashes whenever i do video and voice calls it would not detect the bluetooth device or gets confused to route voice either by phone or headset this is after android  upgrade in s,negative

it is so much easier than normal messaging and i do not even have to worry about costs of sending pictures or calls i really love whatsapp and now can no longer live without it,positive
good app of course but i want to suggest that you make an option for finding all my tags ie  and if someone slides my message to respond to it just like there is a separate place for all media it will be helpful in a group with so many also if there is an option to mark a message by the admins of a group so people can know which is important by just going to the marked messages still like the media,positive
truly a frustrating app if you need to restore backup i wish restoring from backup was not tied to logging in if you have issues restoring backup they require you to reinstall to rectify the issue but they also softlock the number of times you are allowed to log in which means if you dont restore it perfectly you need to uninstall and try again i have been stuck in this vicious cycle for far far too long weeks good when it works absolutely infuriating when it does not work intuitively,negative
