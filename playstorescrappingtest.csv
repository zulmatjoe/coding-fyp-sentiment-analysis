"I've been using Waze since the early 2010s. As of a few months ago, this app is near useless. When I connect my Pixel 6 to my Ford via USB with Android Auto, the Waze screen freezes/ cannot find my location. Sometimes this happens in the middle of my drive to fake me out. This issue does not happen if I use Bluetooth audio only, but looking down at my phone to reset/ view the app while driving is dangerous. The voice now constantly alternates like it's possessed. Very annoying/ creepy"
"The best time to leave feature has a bug. Ridiculous example to illustrate: let's say it is 8pm and you have a roughly six hour drive. This feature gets stuck *trying* to find the best time to leave to still arrive *today* and it will *not* stop trying to recalculate to have you arrive before midnight. There is no way to cancel the recalculate to allow you to choose an arrival time *tomorrow*, and at that point the app is stuck, even if you back out and return to the main screen."
"Overall great app but had to mark it as less than 5 stars in the hope I will get the administrator's attention. I really would like to see under the ""work"" section the opportunity to add multiple locations without having to list them as ""trips"". I visit multiple locations weekly, monthly bi-weekly, etc. for my job. It would be great to be able to add more than 1 specific work address in this section without having to list it as an upcoming trip. Then I could choose which location"
"This app used to be useful for determine traffic and driving times foe the future, but that function has completely disappeared. There's also an incredibly annoying bell notification noise, along with drop down text of the instruction, that persists even if all noises are turned off. When I have all noises turned off, I really mean it. Why is that bell noise necessary? There's already the voice. There should at least be seperate options for this. These notifations also just happen as you turn."
"Longtime Wazer here, who has loved and often recommended the app to others -- until the most recent update. There appears to no longer be a way to plan a future drive (as in tomorrow); the thing thinks you're starting the car right now. If you want to stop the auto-play, you have only a few seconds to hit this strange, new STOP button. It stops -- rendering this entire process futile and frustrating. What did you guys do to the world's best nav app? It's utterly useless to me now."
"I like this app, I have been using it for quite some time. However, in the latest update, which happened in the last few weeks, alerts that come up do NOT automatically disappear off the screen. For example, I get an alert for a hazard ahead (car on the shoulder, etc.), if I do not acknowledge either 'not there' or 'still there' that dialog stays up there on my map display, presumable forever. This did NOT happen prior to the last few weeks."
"I have been a Waze user for years. However, in an apparent update in the last few weeks the notification box of upcoming road events does not go away after timing out. This is annoying because it then prevents the announcement of the next event. Also, even though I have my settings to show the speed limit, it's glitchy. Sometimes it's shows up, sometimes it doesn't. Please fix this!"
Very useful and user friendly. Easy to use and customizable. I like that you can choose the voices and car icons. They could use some more options for things in the road like people so you don't have to see people marked as animals. Loading out start up time/alert button could be made more efficient if you're in an area that has limited data reception. This would cut down on misplaced markers if you're waiting to have gps/ location ability. Ads shouldn't block the map when phone is in landscape
I have been using Waze for years and rarely have had any issues. Over the past year it often doesn't warn me of police reported ahead until they are within a tenth of a mile. That's new and useless honestly. Within the past couple of months the voice would change back and forth. Now the voice is just different. I went through a lot of voice options and can't find the regular one. There was no reason to get rid of the standard voice. It's irritating.
"I've used Waze faithfully for several years now. I'm accustom to the options etc. However the map needs some serious upgrades. It would be so much more helpful if the map was more in-depth. I'm confident it would eliminate alot of rerouting due to wrong turn. EX: show the names of upcoming streets, show traffic lights/signs, show nearby businesses."
"I've been a big fan of Waze for years but over the last few weeks, something changed in the app causing multiple issues. Most prominent: the notification box does not leave the screen anymore (it used to timer and disappear if you couldn't click it, now dangerously I'm forced to), the top bar with time and weather conditions doesn't show up on Android auto always, and the navigation voice sometimes suddenly reverts to a very stilted, jarring computer voice. Immediately back to 5 stars if fixed"
"Bug - No Network Connection when using Android Auto. I confirmed that this is specific to Waze, as Google Maps works just fine, but when connected to Android Auto, Waze doesn't get network connection. I cannot search for places and no routes are found. ETA information is not showing up as well because there is no internet - especially frustrating!!"
"Waze used to be 5 stars, now only one, because of the recent changes they've made to the app. What a mess it is now. Waze used to make announcements about hazards, etc., ahead, now half the time the app is quiet. The ""there/not there"" on screen buttons used to have a timer on them, so that they would disappear in a few seconds, if you don't make a selection....now the buttons remain, never going away. You guys turned a useful app into an irritating experience. Well done."
"Not consistent. At times the app gets discombobulated and spins when you are already moving, freezes when you are trying to decide which direction to turn, flips direction after you are moving, seems not real-time by taking you on a much longer route (i.e. through residential neighborhoods with tons of speed bumbs and stop signs, lower speed limits, etc.). At times, the app goes on the fritz."
"Not sure what happened with this last update. First, the voice I had set prior to the update is now different. Initial spoken directions and random directions afterwards are in a deep generic voice. I since changed to another voice and it seemed to have fixed itself. Second, any on-screen alerts (i.e. speed camera, or the ""still there?"" message, etc. remains on-screen and does not disappear. I literally have to swipe the notification away and even that is tricky to do."
"I absolutely can not say enyabout how fantastic this app is. I like how it warms if there is a vehyon the side of the road ahead, police nearby, and for what it's worth even railroad tracks! The timing of the trip is spot on as well as me being at the exact address I needed to be at. It even gives you options for which route you'd like to take instead of just taking one route. It awesome!!"
"Doesn't allow setting a start place/time. Inside ""View more times"" you enter start point/time, tap Save - later when you select it, it starts from current location/time. When selecting destination, you have a limited amount of seconds before it auto-starts, which doesn't allow you to review and change. When it starts directions mode and you tap Back, instead of cancelling the routing it offers closing the app. You have to manually open the route and Stop. These guys never spoke to a UX designer."
Really great app! However the few issues I've encountered is sometimes it doesn't want to connect and when that happens it still lets you see the directions but it doesn't speak. And the other issue is it's extremely overcomplicated when it comes to saving locations and editing them. It should be intuitive and it isn't. I took another ‚≠ê off for not being able to disable ads. They are intrusive and dangerous!
"All of a sudden, this app mutes the volume for notifications for a *very long* time, much longer than it used to, and far more than is required for the notification it's making way for. Now, I have to sit and wait for 30 seconds for the volume of other apps to resume to an audible level. What happened? Why? Change it back, please."
"App was great on my Galaxy S10e when used through Android Auto. In the dozen or so times I've tried to use it on a new Pixel 7 Pro, it will connect and establish a route, then freeze and not follow the route or provide direction. I have used Google Maps as an alternative successfully on the same device and vehicles. I like the app and interface, hoping the bug can be fixed quickly."
"This recent update broke the app while using Android Auto. Any notification that comes up, whether it be railroad crossing, police, car stopped, etc., It stays there until I tap ""There"" or ""Not There""... With the railroad crossing, I have to exit navigation and reengage it. This is especially frustrating since if I miss it and it stays there, any voice alerts and navigation are stop entirely."
"Still no improvement after months of issues. Terrible. This was my go-to mapping service, but all of a sudden it's janky. And yes, I've deleted and downloaded again. It gets stuck and seems like it. Only updates when I stop. At this point is not worth it, I may just delete it for good. Even after the latest update there is no improvement."
"I cannot hear Waze directionals via Android auto in my 22 Subaru forester. It worked for a month or so and now suddenly does not. The radio or sirius music level drops as if I should hear the Wave directions but nothing...I've gone through the settings in my car and phone but nothing seems to bring the sound back. :( And yes, the notifications seem to remain on the screen for too long. Sometimes, due to driving conditions, I cannot mark whether or not something is or isn't still there."
"""Something went wrong. Could not find route."" Is the message I keep getting when I try to get navigation for my road trip. I usually use waze every year for this specific road trip and now all of a sudden it can't find a route. Waze has just gotten worse and worse over the yeare. Now it's unusable when I need it. Thank goodness for Google Maps."
"What in the world is going on with this app? I usually love this app and it's probably by far one of my most used apps. However, it's not allowing me to put in a planned trip! üò° The app starts spazzing out and won't allow for changes of anything, the date/ time or starting point. It starts spinning eternally and saying ""recalculating"". FIX IT!"
"The app is not bad except the fact you can't enter an address while you're driving, you have to stop first before it'll let you. Unless I'm missing something. At least Google maps lets you use voice to look for an address instead of using a keyboard while driving. Kind of dumb I have to pull over and stop to enter a location instead of on the fly while I'm driving."
"Ask to update prices for gas stations does not stay off! It turns back on every time I close and reopen the app! Fix this please! I wish there was a way to opt out of Recent Locations popping up every time I open the app. I am a rideshare driver and have no need to revisit any of the destinations it pops. If anything has to pop up like that, Favorites would be more beneficial. Also, editing the order of Favorites still doesn't remain how you left it."
"Unfortunately, the app has become unusable. It freezes constantly and fails to lock onto my location. I first suspected my phone (Pixel 6) or maybe Ford Sync system may be the issue. I have ruled then both out because Google Maps works fine. No freezing and no failing to lock onto my location. I can only assume that means some chance in Waze has rendered it inoperable. I have also deleted app, cleared cache, data, etc. It is unfortunate because this really is the hands down best navigation app."
"The thing I love the most about this app is that it automatically syncs with rideshare apps such as Uber and Lyft. This makes it extremely handy and convenient to use. Although the app does contain ads, they are not disruptive and can actually help with certain suggestions such as food, fuel etc... I highly recommend this app as it is very accurate and visually appealing."
"Waze is absolutely unreliable.. takes me down. Closed roads does not reroute me. Puts me directly into traffic. Loses GPS freezes. I have repeatedly submitted feedback. I have been an avid waze user since 2015. The UI is so 2000s hasn't been upgraded so buggy and all you do is keep asking us to clear the catch, uninstall, reinstall, etc etc. And nothing works. I'm going back to Google maps. It's my only alternative"
"I'm loving the app. Everything works very well and runs smoothly. This is surprisingly very competitive if not better than google maps My issue is a small one but that I cannot find any way to copy the address to the place I searched for to my clipboard. This is a necessary feature as I often meet people up at places to buy/sell things. If I can't easily copy and paste the address, I would much rather use google maps. 1 star for now."
"I used to feel like this was the best app and now it's just stupid. It doesn't show locations that are close to me but instead goes off an algorithm to tell me about the locations that I've been to with a similar name previously. It takes you in the most roundabout directions. If you're set up to do freeway, even if a street version is closer, it will still take you on the freeway."
"Planned Drive Feature Doesn't Work. This is a huge issue, hasn't worked in at least 6 months, uninstalled/reinstalled numerous times (had Moto Edge+). Currently, have a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. It will work once after the reinstalling and then it stops working the next day. My calendar permissions are turned on and I rely on it to get to where I need to go on time. I wish Waze could do something to get this to work, it is a very useful feature. PLEASE HELP!!!"
"Recent changes make this more annoying than helpful. When I connect to my vehicle, there is a new screen that tells me I'm connected to Android Auto, and I should use the screen in the car.....duh! The alert pop ups no longer dissappear after passing whatever triggered the notification. If you don't acknowledge, it stays on the screen. Now we listen to two different voices for navigation. It sounds like the Theranos founder using her real and fake voice in the same sentence. Back to garmin?"
"Waze and Spotify are not syncing correctly for about a week. Either when I open Waze, it won't automatically play music like it used to, or I have to open Spotify and go back to Waze (that Spotifys app asks me). Then it will play or still not. When it does play, it keeps stopping, and it's not bc of gps giving me directions. I've used it without a destination and with, and it does it both ways."
What is going on with waze? The app sometimes sends me running in circles. Most of the time automatically closes itself. This app used to be very good. I dont know whats going on. Ive done the updates and still a bunch of issues. Now another new issue is two different voices telling different directions. What's going on
"Using Pixel 7 Pro...GPS on Android Auto works just fine, but with Waze, it either starts working up until a certain point in the journey, then the car location on the map stops updating....or it doesn't work at all. Have had some near misses while driving because of this, so I can't rely on it to function well enough for regular use."
"Doesn't allow access to already downloaded, non-streaming music apps. Your subsequent response to this review only proves my point: every single app that can connect with Waze is a streaming app, not a device-driven player capable of playing a library of self-owned files. And this appears to be a conscious decision by Google across all its navigation services (Google Maps, Waze, Android Auto, etc). We know you once did allow localised-play apps, but dropped these in favour of 100 % streaming."
"Great, but can be better. I like the hazard reporting feature. I would recommend the developers add an option to submit which specific lane or side on the road (left, center, right) the hazard is in as well. It would be super helpful. Some of the navigation is weird and takes unusual routes. Which is why sometimes I prefer google maps. But have waves for hazards. But sometimes waze is ok. Just all depends."
"Long time Waze user but something happened to my Waze lately we everything is zoomed out really far and it makes seeing which turn is coming up very difficult. Yes I've turned off autozoom and 3D for the map and it still does it. As a Uber driver this is not helpful at all, and since Google maps is unreliable, I'll be forced to look for something else until this is fixed"
"For some reason lately when you go by an alert it will no longer time out and clear itself. If you don't answer it as to whether it's still there or not, it won't go away. When this happens you get no further alerts until you answer/dismiss the previous one on the screen. I left the beta because it was so annoying and uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. Nothing changed."
"Thought it would be better than Google maps which is horrendous. While some features are better its overall worse. No live traffic on the map despite turning it on. All roads are just blue, I like what Google maps does by having roads be different colors based on severity of traffic. While it suggests some very fuel efficient routes, it will unfortunately give you an overly tedious and long way to your destination. Should not take 1 hr+ to go 20 miles with no traffic."
"What's going on with the 'Jane' voice? Every turn starts out with a weird, deeper voice now. I thought it was due to my outdated app so I updated it yet that deep voice is still there. It sounds so scary. üòÖ Other than that, I like this app. It goes crazy sometimes when there's poor signal but, overall, it's a good app. Lol"
Switched from Google Maps due to issues with how it works on Android Auto and Lyft. Waze seems to play well with other apps. I am in love with Waze maps. I have changed the voice to my own silly voices. One thing I'd like to see is where stop lights and signs are. Also for it to tell me sooner to make a turn. As is it says turn left 5 to 10 feet from turn. During the day no biggie but at night it hard to see turns.
"Constantly crashes on Android Auto while in navigation mode. This is a significant safety problem. The app remains stable when not navigating, however. This problem has been ongoing for months. I'm running a pixel 4 xl wired to my vehicle via USB if helpful. No I'm just the customer. My expectations are that you take the feedback and follow whatever process is needed internally to fix this issue. I'm also not using Facebook, which is where your second URL seems to take me, to contact you."
"I've used this app for years and have absolutely loved it, would give it 5 stars until the last couple of days when it decided to go goofy. I've confirmed my app is current, so not sure what going on. Driving on vacation, in a large, heavy traffic city and it seems like there is a slight delay or confusion as to which road I'm on. Directions change at the oddest time and don't make sense. kinda dangerous"
"Every navigation app test you test the voices by tapping on them. But even after all these years Waze still can't do that. You still have to select a voice, backup through all of the menus then start navigation just to see what it sounds like. Really! ... Still! People were complaining about this in 2014."
"I recently unfairly gave this app 1 star due to it no longer working with Android Auto in my 21 Jeep Gladiator. In dash display would just lock up and vehicle icon would be stuck in place, in app speedometer would disappear and navigation on screen would completely stop. Per developers, I submitted multiple bug reports and tried just about everything I could think of. Turning off location permission in Android Auto app fixed this!!! All is working again! 5 stars again."
"Never had an issue and it alerts you of a new route if there is a traffic jam. There are directions stay in tact unlike Google Maps when your driving. This Map app also alerts you of police, accidents, hazards, basically all the things you need to be alerted of while driving. Its great in my opinion and super easy to use!"
"No longer able to plan a drive on Android Something really bad is happening at Waze. The algorithm calculate routes in a an inefficient manner. It used to be so much better. Shame After a week of going back and forth with tech support (takes then secretary days to respond to each single message) they tell me, they have a bug and to send a bug report. Sheesh"
"Waze has become completely unusable with Android Auto. It seems to get no GPS reception, even though Maps and my built in navigation work fine. Disabling the app's location permission used to actually make it work perfectly, but that has recently stopped working as the app refuses to even try to function when that permission is denied. I've had to revert to Google Maps."
"Clunky, limited functionality. It's a pain that only 1 stop at a time in a trip can be programmed. Multi stop trips require multiple trips programming. Google Maps does this just fine. Other functions are rudimentary or aging. Lack of real development for Waze is starting to show. (Maps is not really much better, just different)."
I set a female voice and a male voice kept coming on as well as the female. Also the voice prompts were broken and not fluid at all. Not as smooth as Google maps. Love the features but hard to use as a navigation program without fluid consistent voice prompts. Also nearly impossible to add a stop with Android auto.
"Great app, only things it really needs to add would be the ability to show police moving in the same direction with us instead of just sitting. Lastly, the app lately does not seem to refresh as fast. Especially if I'm going faster than what the speed limit is. Otherwise the app is pretty good."
For the most part this app is fantastic. I'm irritated that every time it updates it turns train track warnings back on as default. Also this past update has a bug where the train track notification stays on the screen after passing train tracks. It doesn't seem to turn off until app restart.
Waze is best program for a great GPS drive. I would like to make a couple of suggestions though. 1. Be able to add titles to each drive using an edit feature. 2. Program the voice alert coming up on turn to be changed to 500ft (suggested) prior to the turn. Many times I go by a turn just as the voice prompt me to turn. Hope this is feasible.
"Keeps crashing on Android auto. Voice assistant is bad: i am asking for a specific grocery store, but it provides a nearby grocery store. However i HEAR it say the correct grocery store, but it doesn't provide that option. The navigation is horrible. How is a route that adds 5 miles to my destination to save 1 minute the default choice?"
"After last update the timer on alerts is non existent. It also won't let me see my favorites. It starts to go to the screen then just resets to the home screen. Guess I'll have to just switch to Google maps or my onboard GPS in my Ford. What a disappointment after being a user since the very beginning, at least 10 years."
"Still randomly throws me off by sporadically going off course. Not just getting mixed up on crazy roads or express ways with multiple roads crossing over, no, I could be on a lonely country road and I'll see that the directional cursor will suddenly be way off in what I can only assume would be the woods and the app goes crazy trying to ""redirect"" me. I guess it was the simple straight path I was on that messed it up. But good job fixing the toll pricing while I get lost in east hellhole at 5am"
"I never drive anywhere without Waze on. It has saved my bacon many times. Sometimes it sends me on a strange route but I have learned from experience to ignore Waze at your own peril. There's usually a very good reason you were redirected. And unlike Google maps you can see upcoming speed traps, speed cameras, and red light cameras. Huge!"
"Better than Google Maps, which isn't saying much. Every time I open the app, I have to futz with the settings to try to get rid of the red notification dot. I keep thinking it's something important, like a major traffic issue in my area. I'm not sure if it's showing up because there's no ""Work"" address, because I haven't signed up for carpooling, or because I don't sign up for the ""experiences"". End result, I only open the app if I've gotten lost because I don't have time for the nonsense."
"I switched to waze from Google maps and the experience is.... lackluster. Vehicle i chose randomly switches back to default arrow, there is a noticeable lag ( turn left as I've passed the turn), takes a good 10 minutes to actually connect, and the ads.... intrusive and annoying. Phone's up to date, didn't fix anything. Also doesn't tell you if your destination is on the right or left."
"I used to like Waze. Once Google bought it, just like everything else they touch, it failed. Too many ads, too many distractions. If I'm watching the road ahead for hazards, why would you want to distract me to tell me there's a hazard and expect me to touch the screen to let you know if it's still there? You're creating moving hazards with all the distracted drivers. The only thing giving it 1 star are the voice options. There are better free apps that can do more."
"I was looking for a Google Maps replacement, but this app also has its problems. Pros: navigation directions (overall), e.g.: broadcasting the subsequent turn along with the upcoming one; hazards; easily visible street names. Cons: navigation directions (did not alert me of a turn until I almost passed it); cannot cancel midway stop destination without resetting whole navigation; voice volume too low over bluetooth music; cannot browse map for nearby locations unless inputted into search bar."
No longer moves on screen as vehicle moves. For the past 3 months the screen remains mostly frozen in one location on Android Auto. If I unplug and reconnect it will start moving briefly. Have updated all apps on phone and car. Have changed to new USB cable. Still not working most of the time. 10/11 update: Android Auto updated yesterday. Also turned off location in Android Auto. Waze now works again.
Used to work great and and now it's completely broken. The car won't navigate on screen. It locks you in the same position and doesn't adjust the trip like the GPS is broken. Google maps works just fine in all my Android auto cars but Waze doesn't work in any of them. Not sure why because it only started happening in the last few weeks
"This app is a great useful tool for driving. The only complaints I would have is it would be nice for the voice navigation to tell you which lane or lanes to be in instead of just showing it. Especially for those driving alone. Also I think there should be a way to download previously released navigation voices. I loved the Batman navigation but it disappeared. It would be nice to have it back, or to have a way to download voice navigations previously released."
"As of two weeks ago, this app displays ads no longer just when not moving, but now all the time. These ads cannot be swiped away or otherwise closed, the same ad will stay on the screen, blocking a large part of the map. The ad will not even change to another ad, even after having driven 50+ miles away from that location. The only way to get rid of it, is to force-close the app and restarting the app, then about a minute after that, another ad pops up that behaves exactly as above. Android 12."
"Excellent to stay out of traffic. Works well to give you alternative routes. My only complaint is the reminder to leave: 1.) It doesn't always remind. Actually it rarely works. 2.) You can only set it in 15 minute increments. If i need to be somewhere at 2:40, the only options are 2:30 or 2:45. Update: The calendar connection still does not work!"
"In regards to the latest update; I am extremely disappointed. Once a week I travel 5 hours a day, and thoroughly enjoyed the feature that gave an estimatd time to leave dependingon traffic. This feature is no longer available and for myself the app has become partially useless. The new layout is fresh but I preferred the old version. It also crashes, gives unreliable routes. Sadly I must switch to Google maps. Please bring back the old features and I'll come back."
"I love Waze, but it quits running while in the background. It used to not do that, and it's so aggravating. I usually only use it when we travel, which means my husband is driving and I'm the passenger. So I'll read on my kindle app but can't do that with Waze, because if you switch apps, Waze closes down. It's ridiculous. Going back to Google maps until Waze fixes this. Also, I've checked my settings to ensure it runs in the background. Still doesn't work."
"Navigation is alright, similar to Google Maps, however the excessive ads are a deal breaker. Anytime I come to a stop an ad covers most of the screen, and only goes away when I start driving or if I touch the screen. I get you have to make money on an free app, but the ads are extremely intrusive and too numerous. I may try the app again later if this is fixed. Hell I'll even pay a one time fee for the app if it removes ads."
The ads that drop down from the top of the screen freeze the app and there's no way to fix it besides force closing and re-opening. It'll work fine until you are stopped in traffic and the next drop down ad appears and everything freezes again. Rinse and repeat. This has been going on for 2 weeks now. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app to no avail. I really dislike having to use Google maps but I guess that's my only option now.
Something changed in June/July time frame. We lost the ability to use search in Android Auto on my phone and my wife's phone. The search option is only available when the parking brake is engaged. I'm not talking about the vehicle being in park either. I mean the actual parking brake has to be set and search works. This makes zero sense if a passenger needs to input an address while someone is driving. Google Maps doesn't do this. App also disappears in Android Auto occasionally.
"After a long hiatus, I recently began using Waze again. While there are still things that could stand to be tweaked, it is far superior to Google Maps with regards to long distance routing. Google Maps has more of a minimalist approach, whereas Waze is a more feature-rich application, the most substantial of which is its ability to actively scout out alternative routes to avoid traffic. Waze was able to shave an hour-and-a-half off of what was otherwise going to he a 14 hour drive."
"For an app that's been out this long, there are some truly embarrassing issues. You can't preview voice options, navigating by voice only is risky and will cause you to miss turns because it often announces too late, when searching for addresses there's no zip code in the results, so if there are multiple results with similar names, no way to figure out which one is your destination. Last big not least, outdated speed camera map. NYC installing new ones and Waze isn't keeping up."
"The newest UI update is trash. Instead of being able to see multiple routes at once, it'll just bring tiles up that you have to click to see the difference. The one reason I loved Waze was because it was so simple, you could do it on the fly. I don't want to select individual tiles while I'm driving when I could see the differences beforehand. If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
"Love everything about this app with one huge exception, I can't plan trips from anywhere but my current location. The instructions to change my starting point doesn't work either. Upon reading reviews, I'm finding many others have the same complaints. Why doesn't this app offer a starting point like MapQuest, instead of starting at your current location? It seems unreasonable. I guess I need to go back to MapQuest."
"Under no circumstances, should a GPS app ever, have adds that pop down and take up half your screen. They also do not go away unless touched. It's distracting and could lead to an accident for any person that needs to glance at the screen for navigation. Extended time having to touch the screen to remove an add should not be necessary."
"Absolutely unusable on Android Auto. DANGEROUS! It is August, 2022. For months now, Waze crashes when using it for navigation in Android Auto. On both Pixel 4 XL and 6 Pro. It freezes, reloads, starts over, asks for your destination while actually still working, etc. This is very distracting to the driver relying on this app for navigation. Constantly having to take eyes off the road to try and fix the broken Waze app to no avail. Waze used to be awesome. It has now been broken for months."
"Was hoping to switch from Google maps which has absolutely turned into one of the worst navigation apps, but immediately experienced all the issues I read in the reviews. Some of these include, adds blocking the map, the app crashing, and being sent to the wrong address. After a short while of using this app I will unfortunately being returning to Google maps."
"I have loved this app and used it every car ride since it came out. Unfortunately, I have to switch to Google Maps now. Every trip I take the app freezes, doesn't update and continually crashes. This started a year ago with my pixel 3a and has only gotten worse with my pixel 6a and Android auto. I can actually predict when it's going to crash. I'm so sad, but need something reliable."
"I have no idea what happened to this app. This used to be my go to, but it constantly freezes now whether it's hooked up to my vehicle via Android Auto or just via my phone. The whole point of the app is for navigation. I've had to resort to using Google Maps or my vehicle's native nav application. Very frustrating when driving in unfamiliar areas!"
"It's ok. The routing logic isn't as good as I've seen some people brag about. Update after a 5000+ mile road trip. The app doesn't seem to know that a route is crossing a time zone. When it gives an ETA, it gives it for the one you are in and not the one you want to go to. Also, it needs to realize when I'm getting off for a rest stop or gas or ask if I want to pause instead of freaking out and constantly recalculating. Annoying AF!"
"Update: still a great map, up to the minute traffic updates, still the best map app I've used, but would like to see an update on the app, would like to have the input address always showing, I lost 1 1/2 of work because the voice prompt misunderstood me and sent me 12 miles opposite of where I wanted to go, I was stuck in heavy traffic on the freeway and couldn't safely poke around the waze app, but otherwise still the best app."
Liked the app til you started wasting my data trying to find ads for place on my route instead of showing me my music. Switching back to Google maps. They have all the same features and none of the ads. Had issues with addresses not leading to the correct house. The map telling me to turn as I pass the turn. And app not telling me which side of the road my location is on.
"The ads are a deal breaker. Ads over the map while driving make the app unsafe and intolerable to use. I was originally seeking an option to replace Android Auto for phone screens since I didn't care for Google Assistant Drive Mode. I've since been getting the hang of Drive Mode after leaving Waze. I would consider a paid, ad-free version of Waze."
The app was great until recently. It started popping up asking if I've seen any of these restaurants and it's IMPOSSIBLE to close and it blocks the directions so every time it comes on I end up missing a turn. You literally have to completely exit the app to get it off. I'm very tech savvy so it's not user error.
"I've had issues with Waze in the past but now it's just completely not working. When I open it, there's a message that says 'just a sec'. It never goes away. I thought it was my phone but I see it's not. Get it together Waze! I used to love and spend on this app. Back to Google Maps. Update: I've contacted Waze and they are no help. Guess I'll give up on this app and try another. Google Maps will have to do for now. Very disappointed."
Awesome GPS app especially if you work any kind of delivery job! The users report updates as they come across them so it is always up to date in real time. The only thing you have to watch for is they don't always send you the fastest route first so make sure you check the route options and pick the one that works best for you before traveling!
"There's so many bugs, they never fix the bugs. They removed the report bugs and issues option, guess they don't care. Ads are a pain, childlike interface. Interface is a kludgey, carpool pops up by mistake frequently, does not belong on main screen. Search box moves away when you try to paste. It will usually give you the shortest time route needs a balance between short times and too many detours, u turns through residential neighborhoods. The best thing is police notifications."
"App was working for few days and sudden started shutting. It to the point the app doesn't open anymore. I have uninstall and reinstall many of time. It still not working. Updated 7/29/22. This app crossed my entire system. I spent hours to get my system close to the original setup. After achieving that, I thought it was my system. This app will not work with my system. After installing, it froze. I made attempts to uninstall but it will not go away. Again I for hours restoring my system."
"I used to love this app. Now, it directs me to take a route that is five to six miles longer in order to save one single minute. When I look at the alternate routes, it doesn't even list the shortest one, which is the way that it usually tells me to take. This has been happening a lot lately. It is not due to accidents, road closures, or traffic. I know this because when I go ahead and take the route that I want (against Waze recommendation) I have no issues such as traffic, accidents, etc."
"I used to get stuck once every six months in atop and go highway accident traffic. After the last time I started using Waze. Today I saved myself by knowing the accident was there and taking a different route. Still a great app, it's entire purpose is to help you avoid busy roads. That said, it does not seem to offer a route option to avoid roads with construction. Please add this option."
"I like it for navigation and knowing what's around but, I can't seem to make reports. Both on the app when it's only open on my phone and when it's connected to my Android auto. I will make a report and do it how I'm supposed to and it doesn't go on the map and I haven't earned any badges for any reports. I would also like to see a passive drive feature like Google maps so that I can see road conditions, get alerts and make reports without having to enter a destination like if I'm joyriding."
Waze SUCKS (sometimes)! Remove extras like road hazards/traffic/etc. Focus on working out bugs for navigation. Directed me to exit transition from one freeway to another yesterday and made me late to appt. I followed the direction because I thought there must be an accident. When I looked down I observed the other fwy moving quickly. Does this frequently. Frustrating when I know the area well and just trying to find out arrival time and WAZE attempts to send me wrong direction. Help!
Absolutely something has to be done! For some unknown reason waze continues to direct me in the longest possible route regardless of which route I choose. There absolutely needs to be an option to avoid low overhangs and small bridges with weight limits. And also an option to take the most direct route or stay away from the scenic route. I've wasted hours re directing myself from just the worst possible directions.
"I would love to love Waze but... I only use it on Android Auto and the app lacking especially for setting destinations by voice. When I say navigate to... I get an UNSORTED list I have to try to scroll through in attempt to find the right destination, sometimes with entries for an entire different state. This happens even when a specific address city, state is given. It basically makes the app unsafe to use and VERY frustrating. Google can do better or kill Waze and add features to Maps."
"Crashed constantly on Android auto to the point of being unusable. The occasional restart is tolerable but today I counted over a dozen crashes on my commute home. Switched over to Google maps and had no issues as always. On a new Google pixel 6a and stock Android this is unacceptable. Use literally any other navigation app, at least they'll work when you need them to. The 5 minutes you might save over Google maps isn't worth it when it leads you down a new road and crashes before 2 or 3 turns."
We really like the Waze app but on the trip we just took we had lots of trouble with it. I was riding shotgun and my husband was driving but I had my phone navigating. Anytime I closed the app to do something else on my phone it would stop navigating. The first couple of times I thought I was hitting weird buttons but we ended up missing an important turn so switched to Google maps. It also stopped any time we stopped at a gas station. Don't care for that at all.
"Came over to this nav app from another well known app. So far this one is fantastic in comparison. However, (3* atm) This is in part due to while driving on an interstate for over 300 miles left to go, the app started beeping and telling me to take a road exit for X amount of miles and then would put me back on the interstate (I never detoured because I knew not to) However, to remedy this, I had to completely close the app and restart it. Didn't happen again (glitch, idk). Few other minor bugs"
"Newest update broke the app entirely for me. It's thinking I'm a ""Guest Wazer"" and no matter what I do, it says I have ""no connection."" I've lost all my saved destinations, all my settings, cannot log into my account, and I cannot use the app to navigate anywhere since everything was reset. And to make all this worse, I was discovering all of this when I was trying to navigate to my sister's house to see my newborn niece for the first time! Waze has failed me!"
Waze is good enough when using especially when Google maps doesn't it have a certain address yet on there GPS however Google maps shows you a picture of your destination and also the address number when you're arriving waze doesn't do that and that could be very annoying and confusing especially when you're a delivery driver like myself and constantly using app to get to many homes daily. Also it rarely works when trying to navigate to a destination usually have to press it a few times. Annoyin
"The latest update is horrible. Wazw now has GIANT ads popping up ALL THE TIME covering the screen completely. Massive buttons and search field on the bottom of the screen. Not only that, since the latest update, it's constantly searching for gps. Google maps doesn't, neither do two others I've tried. Just waze. And, if you miss a turn because waze was late telling you to turn, it screams constantly make a u turn make a u turn. Please keep your canned response to yourself waze. Horrible app."
"Waze use to be great. Now it give you a lot of inaccurate directions. It put you in alleys, behind buildings, and also make a lot of unnecessary turns when you can just drive straight. Too much effort is spent on monitoring dead cats in the road and not enough time giving good directions."
"I would give this app zero stars if possible. When trying to change routes, or use an alternative route within the app, the app will continuously attempt to reroute you, even if you say you don't want to! It has added multiple hours to an already long drive since it rerouted after multiple times saying NO! Furthermore if you deviate from the route the app will not adjust routes easily! The app will do stupid stuff like tell you to pull a U turn for two miles at every intersection until updates."
"I've been using Google maps and Apple maps for as long as I can remember, each was only while having that specific moble OS (also had a short lived run with Map Quest way way back). Honestly bummed that I did not try Waze sooner. Though I had heard it mentioned by friends and strangers, I had never tried it. The map, which is community built, as well as app features are awesome; loads better than the others. Definitely my go to map/navigation app from now on. Try it if you haven't ever!! üëçüèª"
"Infinite loop selecting new destination. With a destination already set. Selecting a new destination has a loop of Go step and start drive. The app flip flops between these two screens. ... report submitted. Interesting that there something like 142 logs uploaded. It would be nice to clear all logs, re-create issue, then open report and upload logs. Less to dig through."
If you are driving waze isn't smart enough to change your route. Traffic jam or other. It will mindlessly try to redirect you to the origin route. Also. You should not have to deep dive into the settings to switch to city driving from freeway/toll roads. I had to pull off the road and FINALLY get to the navigation settings.. Atlanta Traffic sucks but now..so does waze.
"For some reason, I want Waze to work for me, so once a year or so I install it again. Unfortunately, there is always something that makes me go back to Maps and uninstall Waze. Tested it again last week. Cut in and out frequently on a 2.5 hour drive and eventually quit on me completely. Uninstalled again. Also, the carpool button is annoying."
"The navigation is terrible, giving no good options for route changes. The GOOD thing is that users can report police and help to avoid speed traps. I will navigate with Google Maps and have Waze open for the police reports. EDIT: The problem is, if I don't like the proposed ""Best Routes"" there is no way to change it to a custom route."
"Used to be awesome. Now a former shell of itself. Road goodies are gone, traffic is NOT updated (can sit in traffic jam for 30 min and it still doesn't show on map), and the routes it creates are less than desirable. Been using since it first launched but now hardly use it much anymore because of frustrating usability."
"A main function of a navigation app is to run in the background and tell you when you need to turn. This app does not do that. It *always* shuts off if you start using another app in the foreground. Going back to Google Maps, even if those directions are slightly less efficient."
"This app used to be amazing. It would find addresses that Gmaps couldn't, find faster routes, heads up to construction, cops, road hazards, & traffic worked just about perfectly. Now it takes me the LONGEST ROUTES POSSIBLE, can't find addresses, MAKES you take routes that are not only inconvenient, but cost you money (like the EZ-Pass only lanes. Used to be ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê now it's üóëÔ∏è."
"I loved the app. As someone else has said, the map could possibly be too cluttered but until recently the spoken instructions have more than made up for it. Unfortunately there seems to be a problem with these now and the voice drops off half way through the instruction. I've tried reinstalling it and it worked for a while then went back to the problem. Any suggestions Wayze?"
"Excellent app, could not do without it. Running on Android Auto. Issue encountered with version 4.89.0.1 where speed alerts and all other notifications remain stuck promptly resolved, and is now working as before. Thank you so much to the support team for rolling out the fix. Waze has been my constant companion on my travels across Europe. I simply do not know how I ever managed without it."
Its a great app but recently the algorithm that determines the quickest route seems to be functioning not well. It suggests me a route and i deliberately take another one and i can arrive earlier than the suggested time. Moreover it is not as easy and quick to access saved locations. The display of soeed limit is also very small and sometimes not easily readable.
"My goto gps app. I wish, though, that the traffic notifications would tell me what the average speed people are going is, it would be super helpful when pla nong a route to know if heavy traffic is going something like 10km/h vs 80km/h. My other complaint is that it loves to take you down a lot of side streets and detours, with not many route options to get out of that and just go down a straight path."
"I really liked that i could plan the trip, and turn off the location to save battery power when i didnt need it. Now it won't let me access app without location! Thats definitly a Minuspunkt. I travel in areas without phone signal, does that mean - I'm without a map then! Thats bad. Waze already helped us out once when we were completly lost in the mountains. Now im worried."
"Overall experience with Waze is very good so far, I really like the ability to navigate to a parking nearby the selected destination, the ability to save the location of the parked car and how precise the navigation instructions are. However I'm removing one star for not having an option to customize how the app displays the ""average speed enforcement zone"", in particular that I can't set it to always show the distance to the end of the zone and that it doesn't show the average speed."
"New update is annoying... When you want to plan a travel, you need to go to the ""plan"" tab and you don't have easy access to your saved places. In previous versions, you could plan a travel as usual and while the was finding the best route, you had the option to leave later and then choose date and time... That was so much easier. Now you can't and this is annoying. Please return to that previous process."
"I've been a heavy user for a long time. However, since the last update, the app has been having a lot of connectivity issues. For some reason, the app induces uploading activity but doesn't download anymore or becomes very intermittend, as such, routes cannot be recalculated. Other apps work fine. My partner has been having the exact same issues."
"I've been using Waze for years with no issues, but in the last couple of weeks I've been getting the same problem brought up recently by several fellow Android Auto users: when alerts pop up on the screen I have to physically close them or they stay on the screen for the remainder of the trip, blocking new alerts til I do so. I commute up to 200km a day for my job so this is really affecting my driving experience. Hopefully it's a bug that can be easily fixed."
Really great app! The traffic information is much more up to date than Google Maps. I love that it includes and gives you the option to confirm if roadworks and speed checks are still there. (If I'm driving my partner will do this and visa versa.) I only update or confirm the roadworks as everyone should be sticking to the speed limits anyway! The voices are a bonus and can make longer journeys less tedious! Terminator is one of our favourites.
"I've been using the app for a few years now, and some small problems have been fixed work quickly so I'm optimistic you can help with the following problems I have experienced lately using Android Auto - speed camera alerts need to be acknowledged with the back button on my head unit. And sometimes this notification can't be cleared and freezes navigation. - route change and other notifications lower music volume, and after the notifications the music does not turn back up."
"It is good. But usability is too poor and limited. When you click or long press destination point you can't see ""save location"" option. Moreover, if you go to ""Saved places"" from search, you can only add address by typing. It doesn't allow you to choose from map. These two a very major downside of this app."
Can't sample the voice selection until you start navigation!! Why?? That's the stupidest thing ever and I have disconnected Waze on more than one occasion and gone back to Google because I cannot change the voice while I'm driving!! Seems like the most basic thing has been hugely overlooked. Maybe the developers should check all various forums coz it's a long standing complaint. Please find a way to get this option!
"Waze is often better at picking up on road closures, etc. than Google Maps. But my issue with Waze is how cluttered it is. The map is very busy and distracting, periodically pop ups or banners will come up that will obscure the map which is dangerous especially when driving in the city as I'll often need to look away and tap to get rid of such banner or pop up. It's all very distracting and noisy. The speed limit should always be visible, not just when you go over it."
"Hi, I've been using Waze a while now, and still marvel at how much better it is at finding addresses and reacting to real-time traffic issues than my old stand-alone Sat. Nav. - I now have confidence the device will get me where I need to be. Would be good to see all possible routes displayed when setting off & seems to like narrow lanes- even if no issues on an easier road. Also can't rely on ETA, regardless of expected flow/other regular data. These are minor issues. Thanks for a great app!"
"5 stars for the directions, -4 stars for the UI which is absolute garbage. It's unacceptable to let me set a different starting point only when previewing a search result, but not when choosing a previous location or clicking on the map. Also shutting down the app completely instead of stopping the current drive when tapping the back button is one of the most idiotic UI decisions ever."
"I'm pretty happy with this app overall as it does get me from A to B consistently. However, my main issue is with the volume which for some reason is quiet to the point of almost being inaudible above the engine/road noise and certainly prevents any music being played simultaneously. Have checked audio settings on phone and in app but can't see any obvious reason. Note from internet research other people are having this problem."
"I just love this app. It works great and it's super easy to configure and use. Funny as well, as you can use different voices and characters with accents. I've never seen any other app do that. The navigation is spot on, and rerouting is very good, always providing you shortcuts and best roads for you. 5/5 from me, it's my go to."
"I would give this app 5 stars if the ""My Waze"" , ""Where To"" and ""Car Type"" banners didn't obscure the bottom of the screen and I could see more of the map. This is particularly bad in landscape mode. A simple screen tap could awaken the selection panes if and when needed. I cannot find any help on this anywhere and it seems such a basic thing."
Only works with gps and user's gps location it's not correctly detected. Cannot be used without gps to plan a route where a user selects manually starting and ending point. Useless. You replied with a way to fix the gps... Did you even took time to reas the comment? The issue major issue is that the app only works and even opens with the gps on. There is no way to define a route upfront by selecting a start and end point. Other apps like Google Maps provide this. Why don't you do the same?
"Works ok but on Android Auto, it's impossible to choose a location on the map and navigate to it unless you use the search bar. Makes it pretty useless if you point to the destination on the map but not the road name or post code. Works fine when not connected to Android Auto so no idea why this feature is disabled as soon as it connects to the car."
"The latest update introduced a bug in which reports are not automaically cleared from the screen. Traffic camera reports can't be manually cleared, so they remain on the screen, and as long as there is such a report, no other reports are shown. Very difficult to use the app in this scenario. I'm mainly using Waze with Android Auto"
"I'd been using Waze for years and had no complaints until a few months ago, after one of the updates. The app just crashes when I try to use and I was forced to go back to Google maps, unfortunately. I tried all the trouble shooting advised by Waze several times unsuccessfully."
"This app has some bugs. I am using this app for last 2 months but not happy with the performance. Interface is very good. However, there must be improvement in the app accuracy. Sometimes it shows the roads which really does not exist. Some destination are not available in this app and shows message ""could not locate the destination"". If the bugs are resolved then this app would be the best app for navigation. This app does not show orange and red coloured traffic indication on the route."
"Does not acknowledge my CHOISE, traffic displayed only when it wants. The 2nd one needs no description. The first issue - i have a route (to office for ex). I open ""additional routes"" and select the 3rd one (purple) that's few min longer but i know it's better for me. I confirm the selection but waze still keeps the first (green) active even though i've selected another one. Doing it once twice or 5x does not matter, it still keeps the one he thinks is best. Edit: how about contact outside fb?"
"20/7/22 Would be good if I could find a voice that completes instructions. All I get is ""in half a mile turn...?"" ""At the roundabout take the...?"" ""In 200 metres turn...?"" Really not helpful! Also I suspect your distances are often inaccurate compared to my TomTom satnav? Edit 23/7/22. Thank you for your prompt reply. I've submitted the debugging report. And received your reply that you're working on a fix. Excellent support, much appreciated! But the app is essentially unusable until you do!"
"Great app, have been using it for the last 5 years and it's a must in my everyday driving. After the latest update I have lost the setting for the gas station. This option does not show anymore under the settings. For me having the option to choose a specific brand is a necessity since I am using a company car with a fuel card. Please fix this issue."
Very useful but beware. I always use it for the school run through Sheffield. Almost always the same route and almost always the arrival time slides back by at least 10 minutes as I drive. Allow for that. Also familiarise yourself with alternate routes. Eg one for me has me turning across traffic on a busy road and that takes a lot longer than Waze allows. Great for choosing routes though as I said allow extra time.
"I have been using this app for years and via Android Auto for 3 years. It has been great until recently when it developed a serious lag making unusable. Having to constantly prod the display to try and get it to update us incredibly distracting, dangerous and probably illegal in the UK. As a result I have switched to Google maps as Waze is no more use than a static map. Experience on a Pixel 6."
"Latest update starts, crashes and restarts several times before offering to report the problem via an app called market feedback, which itself also crashes. All that is before plugging it into Android auto. Sometimes the map displays, sometimes it doesn't. It's a lottery. The app also thinks I'm in the beta program even though I left it. Have deleted the app, restarted phone and reinstalled waze, but it's still not fit for purpose. I'm not sure how you can repeatedly issue useless updates."
"Waze is definitely a good move forward, be good to have Google maps and Waze incorporate into 1 app really as both have useful options. Annoyingly, recently Waze has started to bug when used on Android auto. Not sure if it's Android auto or Waze on this platform that is the problem but bug logs have been provided to Android auto developers. Lastly, why can't there be an option to just announce all speed cameras rather than only when over the limit (by this point you are already over the limit)"
"Been using this app for more than 2 years without any issues. Then the problem has arrived with this app. There is a serious issue with the speed camera function. The notification meant to disappear from the map after you have passed the speed camera. However, the notification will freeze until you finish your journey. Plus, there will be no more speed camera warning after this event(freeze). Please fix this problem. Hope to hear from you soon."
"So far, so good. This app for me works just fine. Maybe a bit cartoonish but it gets the job done. The information on speed traps, break downs etc. can be very helpful. The only real problem that I have is that the audio controls that are on the phone screen, are not available on Android Auto. I only need turn by turn when I get closer to the destination. However, to activate it, I need to stop the vehicle, disconnect the phone and set it up on the phone. I can then reconnect. A real pain."
"On my cars android px30 waze sound is broken. Spotify works, but there is no sound (both: in waze or when it is open in background). Even you connect with spotify, you can see the song is playing, but no sound. When you minimize waze, every other app is hearable. Every background app is forced to not make any sound, when waze is open. Road directions sounds works like it should be."
"The position of the car is always delayed on Android Auto. I've tried everything to solve this problem: update, reinstall, bought a new USB cable, factory reset of the car multimidia system, checking permissions of the app, checking GPS status. I've alerted this months ago, and Waze team didn't fix this and only gives us generic responses. Google Maps is working well. There's no hardware reason for Waze isn't."
"everything works perfectly until the latest update which made the alert and notification stuck on the screen. if i didn't remove it manually, the alert and notification will stay on and no further alert will appear even though I have passed the affected area. I think this mainly affect the AA users and not the ACP users. will really appreciate it if Waze can quickly come out with a solution. it is dangerous to look on the screen and remove the alert while driving at 100 km/h"
"Like the interface and the usability. Two less star because: - voice non loud enough compare to music when using it on Android phone. Google map does a better job about being able to regulate the audio settings - route advice not always the best, again, main competitor app, Maps, provides often better suggestions Hope these 2 points will be sorted soon"
"Great app, that I highly recommend over Google Maps! I made the switch from Google Maps to Waze a few years ago and have never looked back. The notifications for road hazards, hidden police cars, etc. makes my daily commute safer and the fact that I can also provide updates and warnings to other drivers, conveniently through my cars Android Auto user interface makes this the best navigation app that I've come across. Hopefully, Google keeps the app around since purchasing the company."
I'm disappointed with the app for two reasons. 1) When you enter addresses in the car using android auto voice search it often freezes at the last location and doesn't display the actual visible route (only the turn info). 2) when searching for obvious known places it displays a list of results (often totally different places) and it isn't clear which option is the correct one as the description is not specific
"Edit: An update got pushed out and everything seems to work fine for now. After the last update, When using Waze in Android Auto, alerts stay on the screen and don't ""timeout"" like it used to, forcing me to tap the screen constantly to get rid of hazard/police alerts."
"I really rate this app. However. I have recently started getting two voices - 1 that I have chosen and now an American voices randomly speaks. I also find that it gives two lots of instructions in one go. I wish that you could also give a voice command to Google that the hazard is still there, rather than having to tap on screen, which I avoid."
"I'm a cab driver, got to say Very very good. Only downfall - had my first angry moment the other day... Road closed for repairs, apparently preplanned by council well in advance... Apparently wasn't updated to Waze. Kept getting routed back round to the road that I had put the closure warning on. Other than that I have usually found this an easy to use and visually pleasing app. Not too sure about the character and points aspect... Don't really get that bit yet ???"
"Best of the free sat-navs by far. I no longer bother with alternatives as this is far beyond the competition, perfect simple interphase when linked via android auto, only issue that could be addressed is inability to type new address in auto mode, annoying and awkward having to unplug - activate phone screen - re-establish connection - restart auto app, every time. Understandable this may be toyed as a 'safety feature' but surely the ability to type onscreen could be implemented when stopped?"
"Great app, detailed navigation and navigational options Only two thing i would change The option to avoid or even black list certain roads as I drive a moped and try to avoid the A406 in London and to able to move where the speedometer on the screen is since the placement on the bottom left is the worst place it could be for me. Other than that great job excellent app"
"Used to work great with Android Auto on my Samsung S9+. Now with my Pixel 7 Pro it is not working. Like other reviewers said, often the map gets frozen in one location for a long time. So it's useless when it does that. Miss exists, don't get hazard alerts, etc. Happens every time I use it. Please fix! I use it all the time, up until now. Google maps doesn't have this issue."
As others have said also on my previous phone it worked great. I upgraded to a pixel 6 and now the map freezes. As soon as I open the app and put in my directions it will catch up sometimes but it'll automatically freeze again then it'll catch up. Then it'll freeze kind of makes it hard to follow the directions when they keep freezing.....
Waze has been my trusted guide on the road for many years and it has never let me down! My only issue with it currently is the bizarre voice switching that started recently. The most recent update does not appear to have corrected this issue however.
"Before Pixel 7 Pro, it worked most times with Android Auto (Samsung Phone). Since I purchased my P7P, Waze just doesn't work properly in Android Auto, so back to using Google Maps. Issues I'm having are;. Doesn't lock in GPS, it freezes mid drive (missed my exit many times), works then just stops. Deleted cache and data. No issues with G -Maps. Frustrating. I was going to leave 3 stars, but why, the app doesn't work, so 1 star it is."
"Been using the app for sometimes already, told family and friends all to use it. It was good until the last update, where the notification of a speed camera or alert won't clear itself, even I drove way pass the alert area and will not able to pick up anymore alerts until the current one is somehow cleared. This only been happening on android auto, on my phone it works fine. Hopefully this will be patched up soon"
"I love this app! I start it every morning before I get out of bed to get ready for work. My favorite part is the best time to leave feature. Lately I've been having to go to settings, switch a couple toggle switches, then exit out choosing my route, then have to choose where I'm going again. In order to see the estimated time to leave feature. This morning I did it and it's not showing up. Please work on this feature because it helps me tremendously."
"Most annoying thing that is still not addressed is broken Spotify integration. After setting drive route, then clicking on spotify icon, it keeps loading without results eventually promting to open Spotify itself. And even then the integration of Spotify is broken. It doesn't show what is playing, I can't control Spotify music playback via Waze. I have used xiaomi mi 9t and now 11t. Same issues, different phone. There could be some sort of bug reporting feature inside the app."
"Since the last update, it looks like the map is not centralized when the phone is on landscape position. Waze arrow is set more to the right side of the screen. I tried to update and even reinstall the app, but this issue is still happening."
Started using Waze after Android Auto for phone screen was discontinued. Two major issues that make it inferior to Google's navigation: 1. Does not show alternative routes and timings on the map when navigating. 2. Regularly doesn't suggest the fastest route. Many times I ignore the directions it suggests and end up reducing my ETA.
"This app used to be good, i dont know what happened. It takes me on the back roads and the weirdest most stressful ways ever, and half the time it doesnt even work! Ill be following the directions and then it will randomly put me on a different road and reroute me WHILE IM DRIVING and then snap back to normal. In that time, i am now driving aimlessly until it snaps back, 30 seconds later. Extremely hard to use now. Only good things are the customizations."
"After this update the app has been telling me to constantly do U-turns onto roads that aren't near me while stopped at a light. The app would also change it's voice while giving directions (including the U-turn BS) Please fix this... TBH, this has been getting worse over the years. I don't want to use Google Maps as my default, but Waze is getting so bad that I might have to ‚òπÔ∏è"
"Suggestion to add a button at navigation screen to turn on the toll and avoid toll route which is easier for user to control. Sometimes we are willing to pay toll when in a hurry and sometimes not. Also, we might want to avoid toll if that particular route toll fare is too expensive. Currently we need to go to setting > navigation > to turn on/off. Thanks"
"There is a new reroute notification and you can opt to keep the existing route or go for a reroute. Unfortunately, sometimes the buttons are frozen even after pressing one and need to restart waze to fix it. Also, the voice is changing like a horror movie. What's happening?"
I like using Waze and would have given 5 stars but within the last 2 weeks warnings that appear on screen do not disappear after you've past the warning (red light camera as an example). The warning stays on screen until you shut your car off. Hopefully they fix this in a new update.
"The app is glitchy. Especially when someone shares a trip via Whatsapp. The icon of the person driving does not move. Whatsapp hangs and must first close both apps. It doesn't shut down by itself, it doesn't track the trip. I have a love/hate relationship with waze"
"Not as good at finding an address as Google Maps. Gives multiple options, where Google know the right one. Weird. Android Auto zoom in and out based on speed is way too extreme. Why do you not wait until AFTER am obstruction/police/... before closing the acknowledgement? Give the driver time to verify and then respond!"
"This used to be a sure fire 100% 5star, but a recent update seems to have changed a few bits! Used to be able to select favourite fuel type but that has disappeared....... Ability to plan a drive for later now doesn't work properly either ....... Tried reporting it but the defect logs don't seem to send properly now..... Please sort this out - used to be so good but now a bit dodgy......"
Very good!! One of the most useful apps for driving due to the reports function that every member of Waze can use. Especially as it updates the map instantly so everyone knows of any hazards or whatever else can be reported.
"After update, audio still unusable. Only Mrs Claus is okay. Tried about 6 others and they all cut out mid-sentence, every sentence and volume for each voice is not normalised, at same setting some are very loud and some so quiet can't use."
"Recently, Waze directions keep recommending to exit and take side roads instead of staying on the highway! I've checked settings, and don't know why. I ignore the exiting and arrive in a timely manner, knowing if I exited it would have been grossly a longer drive."
"Tried it for a bit, like to use it horizontal but there is a large next turn black box blocking half the screen that waze won't change . Bought a new sat nav now so I can see the screen . Could be a brilliant app but waze won't listen to customers."
I have used Waze for a long time and recently it's become so frustrating it's unbelievable. The current issue with lagging is making this app unusable. It's got so bad I've had to go back and use Google maps. Please sort this issue out.
"Don't usually write reviews. Moved to Dubai and been using Google Maps but switched to Waze. This is a marriage saver :-) . So much better than Google Maps based on our experience and opinion. Clearer, quicker and more accurate directions and maps. The gold standard would be if Wazr could map some of the large Dubai Mall car parks so you can leave via the best exit for your route. In somewhere like Dubai that would be brilliant. Great job, keep it up."
"Honestly app has absolutely gone to hell. Stop these useless colabs (Christina Aguilera???) and get the app actually functional again... Notifications pop up and don't go away, when starting a route GPS freezes in place until route is cancelled, asking for a destination over assistant leads to a list of places none of which are usually the right address. For the first time in years have moved back to Google Maps which is likely Google's goal... Severely disappointed...."
"Fastasic navigation app. I like it a lot. Have been using it for years, however as of late, I think the app is going through puberty and midway through sentences, the voice (US Jane) changes to a deeper voice tone. It is downright weird. Please issue an update, is creepy."
"Lately Waze seems to have multiple personalities. The voice will change mid sentence. Also, it sometimes gives incomplete directions. For example it will say ""in 900 feet"" and then nothing. Unless you were looking at the screen you wouldn't know what to do."
"I usually love this app but the developers often introduce bugs that are annoying (at best) or even dangerous. The most recent bug requires you to manually dismiss alerts rather than having them auto-dissapear. On busy roads you either have to keep dismissing alerts or have the map be less useful as it's busy showing non relevant messages. Further, reporting bugs is near impossible as their support contacts are non-existent."
"When I get an alert about anything on the road it stays up blocking every new alert until I somehow clear it out on android auto. The whole thing using this dammn app is to get notified about these dammit. I googled it and this bug exist since november and waze didnt give turd to fix it since. Okay now it got fixed, now I should be grateful until a new bug arrives?"
"I love this app, I use it on the daily. It's very helpful in finding the quickest route, and knowing where heavy traffic and police are hiding. I will say, living in an area where there is heavy train traffic, it would be nice to be able to alert when railroad crossings are blocked. It would save a lot of time waiting at the tracks if we knew to take an alternate route."
Waze keeps thinking I'm on the opposite side of H-1 East around exit 10 in Honolulu. Give me an email address and I'll send the screen shot. This has been going on for months. (This is still going on. One minute it has me traveling property on the correct side. Then it moves me across and is giving me exits to take on the other side. A fix would be nice. Why would I drive for 5 miles on the opposite side of a highway?)
"I am an avid Waze user and have been for many years consistently achieving crown status. I was always rec coming pple to use waze over Google maps (I know Google owns) . Recently, it has been terrible. The arrival time is always wrong. Sometimes I'm taken to routes that extend my drive time. Google maps is almost pinpoint on accuracy and drive time and takes much simpler and efficient routes. It pains me to say I'm considering deleting the app, love the community but it's awful now."
Thanks Waze! Waze know's the way. Each update gets better with Waze ü§óüöî Keep up the great work! UPDATE! November 2 Waze is not working properly. It freezes and disconnects while driving. Taking away 3 star until fixed. Using Andriod Auto and Maps both freezes while driving. Not Good! Please fix or refer to better working apps. UPDATE DEC 4 2022. USED waze first time since last malfunctioning. So far it worked flawlessly. Will attempt again and add a star each time until maximum performance.
"**UPDATE** Can we please please get picture in picture feature?!? I absolutely love Waze, but one feature that I really wish they would implement is picture and picture. I use Waze on an everyday basis for my driving navigation for work and I am constantly jumping between the phone app and the GPS app, so it would make my life a lot easier and less accident prone if picture and picture would be implemented. Other than that I absolutely love the app thank you!"
I am using this app for the last two years mostly for map and speed alert. Though this app mostly up to date in respect of traffic but sometimes failing to warn road closures. I think this feature should need a boost. The other thing I can suggest to use voice alert for speed change (warn the driver of the current speed limit by saying i.e. 30 miles). I hope millions of users will benefit from these features. I hope waze will look into these and accept them. Thank you.
"This mapping is used with Autocab so when I except a job I get a quarter of the map and just a circle going around, I have had it looked at by 3 tech people and they can not work out what's going on. It's been uninstalled and phone cleaned then reinstalled. I really don't get on with Google Maps please get it sorted I can't forget mh job. Its doing this on a relatively new phone a Samsung M33. If I could no stars I would."
"Was a good app, then a few years ago they took away the fastest and shortest option and the server now does the ""best"" route. Not sure how it works that out but fed up of being told to go miles out of my way just because theres a motorway which is ""faster"" when there is a clear and shorter route... And that problematic behaviour just seems be getting worse over time."
I haven't been able to use Waze most of 2022 as it blanks my car screen and makes android auto unusable. Judging by the many posts I'm not alone and I can only conclude Waze development is lagging behind. Edit: send debug report to Waze as requested.
Recent updates to Waze and Ford Sync 3 have improved the experience but still having the frozen map issue intermittently. Force closing the app on the phone sometimes helps. No option for wireless AA so stuck using AA via USB.
"Needs a few things to be fixed: 1) It keeps routing me down narrow residential streets with road humps to try and save a few seconds. It should keep to main roads unless they are blocked, both for my sake and for those who deserve to have their residential streets left peaceful. 2) I need a single button to push if the road ahead is blocked. Otherwise it just routes me back to the blockage. 3) Should let me select alternative roads to customise my own route."
"Usually pretty good. For whatever reason in this version I am reviewing, ways decided to change my route after making a detour, took me down the route that I specified not to go down, taking me a further distance, and taking me through a Tollway that I specifically tried to avoid. I expect this from Google maps. Just disappointed, and slightly frustrated. Will get you to the destination, but might not take you down the route you want."
Would be 5 stars if it would allow you to do voice input (for stops/searches) while driving and give options for HOV travel while in Android Auto. Having to pull over while on a freeway to add a stop if it is not within your most recent stops is really frustrating and dangerous.
Would get the app five stars but with the new update something changed where it asked you if something still there and you have to answer the question or it stays on the screen blocking your view. Sometimes it's not safe to take my hands off the wheel to tell you if the car or police is still on the side of the road. The Box used to disappear about 10 seconds after you passed the location
"This latest update totally ruined Waze. So many issues with routes, arrival times being off by several hours, tells you a shorter route with tolls is recommended but you have selected to allow tolls and there is no route listed with tolls! My god, give us back the old Waze. If its not broke, don't mess with it! Stop playing with Santa characters and give us back the Waze we love!"
Used to be great but it's been glitchy lately and can't find the route home. It'll show me still at work when I'm mere mins from my home. It glitches out quite often where it will show my vehicle not even traveling on roads. Switch to Google maps & it's fine. These are routes I use daily but all of a sudden don't work. What gives? ü§¶üèºüôÑü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Been using it with android auto for a year now. While routes are okay, the ui is buggy such as speed checks lasting a long time. No EV support, even basic (it doesn't have to be ABRP from day 1) is unforgivable. Can only set car type as fuelburners, and no 'find fast charger on route' button or even filter able Poi's is just bad."
Needs improvement ASAP! I have this app since a month ago and sometimes it tells you to stay in the left lane and bang! Suddenly gotta turn to the right and vice versa and there's nothing you can do except taking the long way or wait until you reach a place where you can turn around. The other day I ended up at a dark place with barely lamp posts because the app confused me while turning at a stoplight and then changed the route!... This is dangerous guys...
"Killed by ads :( The layout was a little busy and response sometimes clunky, but I have used it as a map alternative for years, but last month tried it and the amount of sponsored ""points of interest"" (heavy sarcasm) and then the super-annoying ads all but ruined it for me. Certainly not worth the marginal benefit"
The app works enter for finding places then Google maps. It has an issue of getting a head start for me. The voice talking sometimes is a street before me. Just yesterday I was inside a restaurant typing and address the app gave me a warning don't text and drive. This is not a good thing since then I can be blamed for something that I wasn't even doing.
"The app was unusable for 3 months with Android Auto. Now that Waze and Android posted some new updates, I am able to use Waze again with Android Auto on my Pixel 6 phone. I will test some more before giving 5 stars. Update: Used Waze again the next day. After driving about 10 miles, the GPS frozen again. Back to Google Maps...ugh. Update Part 2. Turned off location permission on Android Auto as others suggested. Waze worked great. You never know what to expect any more."
Slight problem with the latest update. When the speed camera warning pops up it does not close after and subsequently doesn't work after. Looks like it's frozen. I tried removing and reinstalling the app but no joy. I have a galaxy note 8.
Since the last update the app has been nothing but a bug fest constantly bugging out and freezing especially when it comes yo speed cameras the speed limit signs started to bug about abit and it also likes to take me down roads im not supposed to go down and also on mystery tours which take longer to get to my destination and parts of the maps go missing too! it needs fixing
"1. It says ""something went wrong"" and gives up on me; GPS has me, Waze has a map on screen, but it can't find a route (while Google Maps can). 2. Interface is clumsy and could be more to the point, also not so easy to add stops along the way."
"Has now taken me twice through the congestion charge zone, despite it not being added as an exemption on my settings. When I asked for alternative routes, it didn't give me any alternative but to go through the congestion charge zone. Cheers Waze, let me know where to forward the charge too. Will be moving over to Google Maps where the avoid toll option should hopefully fare better."
Absolutely the BEST real-time navigation app. Has gotten me to my appointments in Boston each and every time because it finds the back roads that are less congested. Just trust the app and it will get you there. And to know where the cops are hiding is a huge plus.
All of a sudden waze went from ok to useless They still havent fixed the Jane Voice she sounds like a lethargic drunk not much help when your stuck in standstill traffic all day may be time to uninstall and ditch waze for good its taken the powers that be way too long to fix this its been months now and every new update does nothing to correct the voice
Planning a future drive is frustrating. It's like it has a bug or something cause it says route too long and keeps glitching and won't move onto the next day. Please fix and I'll bump it too 5 stars.
"Not a BEST maps currently, but for heavy map user especially for delivery workers like me we have less option for getting into the route precisely. Before several updates, it was just nice. After several updates, FATALITY. One more stupid thing I discovered when we are the heavy traffic, moron thing happens when they assumed we ride in the incorrect direction and giving us the next route, or reroute. I guess not o myself are aware about this."
"Its an ok app 3 stars for directions. Watc out usualy he send u behind building or worst in vacantion ibset waterfalls and he took ne ontop of mountain instead main entrance. Bugs like mseeages with no internet when i have 1gb/s or new car stay in middle of map not bottom like were uaed. Also "" you are here "" stay for 5 sec wich ia very annoing if u have to make atight turn u will miss that . Make that message gone in 1 sec or when i start moving."
"Waze is a fantastic navigation tool, especially on Android Auto. It has much less clutter than Google maps, and is quite simple to use. It also has a speed limit indicator and speedometer, which is quite handy. Since it's data is often user-generated, it tends to be updated much quicker than maps. My only complaint is that the speed limit indicator should be a little larger, it's often difficult to see."
"Best app for navigation, but lacks improvements. Experience with Android Auto is extremely poor and forces me to disconnect from AA to perform some operations. Edit: asked to submit more feedback, but I can't reproduce functionality that is not there. Also, I do not use messenger."
"Used to be great, until it wasn't :-( Early September, started freezing mid route. Have to close the app and start again, only for it to freeze again. Froze 4 times on a trip to the Gold Coast from Northside of Brisbane. Gave up and went back to Google maps. Tried again today, a month later and still freezing. Again, had to go back to Google Maps to get me to my destination. Disappointing as it worked so well when it was working. Android user."
Agree with Harry below. Spotted camera doesn't disappear after it's been reported on waze. Tried to go thru the whole debug thing but I don't live in an area with fixed speed cameras. Only when travel occasionally into town. Not sure how I'm supposed to screen shot with android auto either. Please fix this issue.
Hands down best app to use for navigation. Always gives you alternative routes to avoid traffic which is just the best! Notifies you of small things on the road as well!
"Fix the dang voice!!! It's so bizarre. It changes and it's honestly a little scary. Updated:: I am not even using this app now. I can't stand the voice issues. But more importantly, it leads you right to traffic!! It doesn't work anymore."
"I LOVE WAZE except for ONE MAJOR ISSUE.... I CANNOT SAVE LOCATIONS ANYMORE!! I have put in 10 trouble tixx about it and NO ONE is actually fixing the problem. I have WAZE on 2 different phones and I have the same issue on both! Furthermore, my LOCATIONS are not synced up on both phones! This issue is a nightmare. I travel A LOT and I need to be able to save LOCATIONS for future reference! PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE BEFORE I JUST HAVE TO STOP USING THIS APP!!!!!! üò§ü§¨üò§ü§¨üò§ü§¨üò§ü§¨üò†"
"This app sucks. I have used it foe several years with out a problem Now it takes me out of the way lost. It takes you north to go south. I tray to get on a familiar route, but still gets me lost. I had to go south, took over the border (toll), then took me out of the way north past where I need to get off and to a totally different town I have never been to. I don't trust this once great any longer. What a shame."
"Fantastic app, just need to add Google Podcast support! Considering it's a Google app, plus the audio player image in the app store has Google podcasts icon, it baffles me why it is not a featured player within the app. Other than that, by far the best navigation app there is."
"Great app, however it fails to notify the speed camera app, it worked for a whole but since last update it does not recognise speed cameras that was there previously. So on that sense it's quite unreliable, over all its an excellent app and have been using this since day one. P.S. PLEASE CAN YOU KINDLY ADD MOBILE PHONE CAMERA AND SEAT BELT CAMERA ON THE APP"
"This app was working perfectly until recently, the on screen alert pop-ups do not disappear once you drive past. I always have to swipe it away and it's very annoying. If I don't then I won't get notified of the next alert. SMH"
"How to change from Petrol to Diesel??? It was there before, notin the menu anymore. The new app is now slower to start, requires 2-3 more confirmations on the com. buttons The route calculation goes for the longest route, that takes even longer, consistently, day after day. Didn't improve in the last 12 months. Consistantly changes up the settings, and everything else. Can't now change from Petrol to Diesel anymore. The most stupid and unconvenient app ever!!!"
"It used to be good but now you have to manually remove the speed camera notification. Back then, the notification box will go away after 5 seconds passing by a camera. If you don't clear any notification, you wouldn't get other alerts. This is silly as it takes aays my focus on driving."
PLEASE BE WEARY OF ROUTES!! We had the most terrifying experience on our drive to Plettenberg Bay from Bloemfontein. Ways rerouted the trip via PRINCE ALFREDS PASS (please google). It is 68km of gravel road up and down the mountains. No escape and it ends in a township. It was the stuff horror movies are made of!!!!
"I'm not interested in putting a destination to anywhere. I just want traffic news. I find your ads to be distracting even when at a stop!!! I do not want ads even thou your app is free. With ads and destination on, there is no map to be seen on my smartphone."
Current update needs a few issues resolved - speed camera alert notification fails to disappear (however selecting up arrow to open routing submenu for active journey then down arrow to deselect will also clear speed camera alert notification... Speedo readout has also disappeared from view and volume levels of background (radio etc) is affected...
Can't change the distance in which driving directions alert you. This is extremely annoying and makes the app unusable. You literally have to wait until you get 100 feet from a turn until anything is announced.
Waze is great. But in the last month or so the notifications such as cameras or hazards become stuck and won't disappear after being passed. This can mean I spend miles with old notifications that won't disappear and no new relevant ones for the upcoming journey.
"Would it be possible to have a fullscreen option for the spotify player or msking the buttons bigger. Currently the like button is exactly the same size as it is in spotifys app, making it almost pointless to use it in Waze while driving"
"Overall Amazing app and very up to date. My only concern is if the developers add Pop down screen ( use Google maps for multitasking), would be great if waze had the same feature! Other than that it's the best app for navigation!üëçüëç"
"Does not work with Ford Sync 3 (Ford Ranger). Navigation screen keeps freezing and does not update location in real time. I switch to google maps and it works perfectly, so it's obviously a Waze issue"
"I'm really impressed with how good it is, I don't use my Tom Tom any more Waze has everything that I need, Red & Speed Cameras, Speed checks and the quickest way home when I get lost in this great big City I call home üè°. Thanks devs for a really useful App that is really helpful and easy to use,5 ‚≠ê‚≠êüåü‚≠ê‚≠ê for a really awesome App."
"Most importantly, Waze has repeatedly instructed me to turn left over a curb, drive the wrong way down a one way street and do other inexcusably wrong and hazardous things through it's faulty directions. Also, Waze has a lot of great options, but has a clunky interface concerning address input from other apps."
"With latest update, as usual I just wanted to lookup some possible trips not originated from my current location in order to plan ahead, but now the app does not even do anything without the GPS turned on. Intentionally blocked. Dispicable! Can't even select ZERO STAR. I am not buying anything. Making targeted effort to block it now?? Really? - Come on man! (J.B.)"
"Relatively happy overall, considering Google Maps doesn't work correctly with my setup (android auto with retrofit Carplay unit) BUT when a speed camera is detected, the on screen warning doesn't disappear & the next speed zone or camera is not indicated unless the original is cleared manually. Not great. Please fix."
"Issues since last update. There are now two different voices guiding me, switching between the two every other statement! Notifications get stuck on screen. I now must choose an option i.e., ""there"" or ""not there"" for it to disappear. Extremely annoying! Please fix!"
"It used to work well with android on my pixel 3. After updating to a later version of waze, it stops working with voice command that can only come from Google Assistant. This problem is there either I use Waze on my phone directly, or via Android auto on my car. I am with android 12 and the latest Waze build dated on Nov. 14th 2022 now but the problem is still there. I have been trying to uninstall/reinstall Waze and Google assistant, and clear the cache, etc. None of these help."
"Had to uninstall because all of the alerts for police and such show different miles but all of them show the same area (Silver Springs, MD) even when we have already passed their. Also when the alerts are posted it only says,""9,10, 20 minutes etc by (blank)."" No Wazer is shown to have posted the alert and not just for police but hazards in and around the road along with construction, vehicles on the side of the road."
Does not work well with android auto. Location continually freezes which makes it hard to follow directions. No issues using google maps. I thought it might have been my phone pixel 6 pro but recently upgraded to pixel 7 pro and same issue. Really frustrating to use.
"Just recently, I've noticed that the alert notifications (i.e. Red Light Cameras, Speed Cameras, Hazard Ahead - Vehicle Stopped, Police Ahead, etc.) won't leave my screen after I have passed that issue/event unless I clear it out (i.e. Press ""not there"" or for cameras or police, I have to swipe it off the screen). Other alerts won't come up unless I clear out the alert where before it would time out automatically. I have cleared the cache on the application, uninstalled Thanks üôè Amir Sydney AU"
"Need a easy on/off alert for an adjustable amount over if you accidently speed. Or an alert for when the speed limit will decrease beyond a certain threshold within an adjustable distance. For truckers, a setable timer that starts on certain conditions like movement past 100m. Then they know shortly before they need to rest. You could advertise hotels, food, rest stops within that set timer, 30min before they need to pull over."
"App used to be really good, but recently the notifications are not clearing on their own (red light camera, speed camera, vehicle stopped, etc.). Please fix this issue. It's unsafe for people to be driving and clearing notifications."
"I stated the app took me the long way before, the recent updates have stopped that. Now however, the voice will change to a deeper slower voice like it's struggling to work properly, but will do it for two sayings then back to normal."
"Okay, so once again, I'm sitting here at a complete stop on the freeway due to an accident. This is not the first time. Waze does NOT forewarn or detour drivers soon enough. I am returning to Google Maps as they do a much better job updating traffic in real time."
"Using the program for a while worked great. Since recent update, I get different voices for directions. I also have to swipe away red light camera and speed camera warnings in middle of driving which would go away by itself, otherwise I don't get new warnings."
"UPDATE: Waze deleted my account without me asking them to Multiple app updates since original review and still only showing toll roads as options. ""avoid toll roads"" doesn't work. I click on routes only to get shown 3 options, all using toll roads, and there are multiple non toll roads available"
"Great app, especially the lane details are extremely useful. Excellent app overall! Thankful to the development teams effort. One probably well known issue is that the speed camera alerts freeze on the screen in Android auto which requires a fix!"
"Latest update has bugs. ""Still there"" is stuck on the screen till you hit yes or no. The female nav voice has multiple personalities. It tried to have me turn the wrong way on a one way street. Not good."
"What are these directions?? Why am I constantly taken the weirdest way possible? Waze regularly takes me literally miles through neighborhoods. Ads pop up and won't go away while making directional changes. I only use this for the alerts, but it's not even worth it anymore."
"When getting a locations directions, the radio turns off and won't go on again unless you restart. The railroad warning stays on after the actual crossing. The voices change. It was working fine until......"
"Always been a 5* app for me in the past but now have same issue as Sam reported earlier... ""Buggy since latest update on Android, android connect to my Ford transit is where I've noticed the bug. One alert for a speed camera and then the alert stays on my screen & don't give a notification for a new camera."""
"When an alert like Red Camera or Rail Crossing pops up it wont clear once you pass it. Only way to clear is when another alert comes or by going into a menu like the report section. This happens in AA and without, and only starting happening in the last two weeks."
"Sends me down unpaved back roads even if I've asked not to. Doesn't always send me on the quickest route. I'm irish I want my voice coach and alerts in an Irish accent. Speedometer Doesn't match my cars Speedometer even in cruise control on a motorway. Which Speed do I believe, also there is no option for walking mode to use if I'm trying to find somewhere while walking"
"In the most recent app update, the hazard alert pop-up does not close on it's own. This causes more interaction with the screen while driving when you should be paying attention to the road. This change is a safety hazard."
Why in the last version it became impossible to use the app without location turned on? It makes it impossible to plan a drive in the future from any location. It was possible up till now and is very frustrating that you changed it.
Don't limit the routes suggestions. It recommended a pricey toll route that even need to spend more time and money. Not allowing me to select another route. I have to manually choose the toll and add stop to check the traffic conditions.
The fact that it doesn't support my default music app (MediaMonkey) means I uninstalled it straight away. All other navigation apps I've tried don't tie you down to a minimal choice like this.
"The ""candy""/""points"" feature is obnoxious, dangerous, intrusive, pointless, and has been complained about for several months. I am honestly, seriously considering using a different map software."
Great when it works. Lately my red light camera and railroad notifications will not go away once it pops up. It's annoying for when I'm doing cross city trips and don't know where all the cameras are.
"Using Android auto; this app does not always pick up speed cameras, and if it does, the audio alert is not distinctive even though I have audio turned on. Is there a way to customise the sound or make the existing sound more noticeable?"
That's a great app I've been using it for years but recently have been experiencing problem with speed cameras and red light cameras after it announces and I passed these cameras it stays on the screen and doesn't function properly I have to unplug my USB from my radio in order to restart the Android auto app to get it to work properly and it just freezes again after another camera is this an issue with this app or is it an Android auto issue
"Seems there is an issue with Android Auto? Some times it doesn't appear at all, sometimes is cut out. Also, after passing a railroad crossing, the railroad crossing widget on the left stays on forever."
I'm using Waze on an Android head unit. The Navigation is pretty good. It is however slow to load. The ads are annoying but the worst feature is the constant binging of the points system. THIS IS MOST ANNOYING WHEN TRYING TO LISTEN TO MUSIC ON THE SAME HEAD UNIT!!! Waze intermittently mutes the music and bing's to indicate I have received points. I DO NOT CARE!! Please add a feature to turn off this annoying interruption and yes I've requested this change via the Waze suggestion interface.
"This is one of the better navigation apps I have used by far...accurate good graphics, although 3D maps can do with some tweaks . Operates good, never got lost yet."
"Why do you need location just to view drive planning. 1 star. I just want to view what time I need to leave but now I have to turn everything back on just to view what time. I should not be forced to have location on just to view app. I was so close to just deleting it and since update, after leaving location on for a while. App seems to have problems recognizing my location. I don't see how when I app has been running even when not in use. 1*. Probably will just delete this app soon."
Update: Debug logs sent. Vehicle 2019 Ford Ranger running sync 3. Still nothing from the Devs for 3 months and recent updates downloaded but app is still unusable on android auto... what's the point? DELETED THE APP... GFSF Original Post: Flat out doesn't work on android auto... Frozen solid as if you aren't moving... Before this happened it rarely showed your speed. Google pixel 6 pro (I had enough problems with this phone without adding this app issue to the list) Jesus fix it....
"I saw other users reporting the ""route not found"" error, which i am having now. it's worth noting that when i find the destination address in the search, it looks correct - but when i choose to navigate to it, parts of address get doubled or tripled, and THAT is when i get the route not found error..."
"Tried Waze again after a few years to find it still doesn't have an option for yards. Announcing distance to junctions and turns in feet means nothing to UK users. The official unit of the UK is yards, which every other sat nav out there supports. Drives me nuts to the point where I've stopped using it again. Lots of users have voted for this, but it's being ignored as shown by the fob off response to this review. Arrogant of Waze to ignore the unit used by an entire country. Silly and lazy."
Quit wasting your time with Google and start using the best navigation app on planet Earth it tells you when there's debris in the road ahead when there's a police officer ahead when there's a wreck ahead when anything's going on around you all your other drivers have passengers in the car a lot of the times and they will pinpoint exactly where things are and it'll ask you is this still in the road is this rest still there is this speed trap still there and you get to be a part of the system.
"I have been using my Uber and Lyft driver app to send my destination to Waze while I have Android auto running. After the update, waze doesn't receive and process the destinations sent by the third party apps properly.Also the new pop-up message that appears on the device when you open Waze while connected to Android auto that tells the user that waze is running on car is very annoying because for every destination I send to ways I have to manually go back to the app I was using"
"I've been an advocate of Waze for years, getting many friends to join the community as well. Recently however some of the routes that are being given are awful. Today I was sent on a 3 mile detour with a 30 min wait at a set of temporary traffic lights. There has also been a lack of warnings for police & hazards on the road recently. I hope this isn't a sign of what's to come or a change back to Google maps may be on the cards. Waze take this as the complaint and don't ask me to email it over."
Works great most of the time the reporting of police and hazards is fantastic. Speed doesn't always display and sometimes the car stops moving on the map and needs to be closed and reopened (this is while using android auto in my 2017 mustang with sync 3 infotainment unit)
"Someone told me about this app a few years ago. I downloaded it and was immediately impressed! I'm an anxious driver when driving in unfamiliar areas and am used to country driving. When I went to Atlanta GA I drove effortlessly in multi-lane traffic. NEVER would I ever have without WAZE! The updates on road conditions, debris, traffic, etc is extremely helpful as well!! Phenomenal!!!! üåü üåü üåü üåü üåü!"
"I am experiencing the same issue that other users have reported concerning waze on pixel 6, Android 13 and Android Auto. The application ""freezes"" with the only guaranteed fix being an app restart, not practical when driving. My display head is a Ford sync3. 10/25/2022 Uploaded logs, seen two updates and waze is still broke with AA."
"Not a great experience so far. Trying to move from Google maps on a recommendation, firstly the GPS location update was slow and sometimes not happening. Had to disable location services on Android Auto! Not great, shouldn't have to do that."
"Please make the app and all its functions work when connected to Android auto ...what's the point of the app when you can't report closures while driving and then the app keeps rerouting you to the closed streets . Your help center person told me to unconnected my phone and do it on my phone ..while driving ..which is illegal not great advice. This seems like a no Brain-er solution to me update the app so all functions work when connected to a car, otherwise the app is useless not in real time."
I dont know where to report a bug. So I am gonna put it here. When you start your drive and i alerts you for camera normally the little warning pops up and then goes instead it stays on there and blocks a lot of the map and it also stops alerting otherwise the app is not half that bad.
"Long delay to start navigation is dangerous for rideshare drivers. When I accept a trip, the rideshare app automatically begins navigation in the default app, and Waze has such a long delay to start that it is easy while driving to go just past an intersection and then either lose money or make dangerous driving decisions. All for a stupid and pointless delay that cannot be disabled."
I prefer this app to Google maps because it gives you route options. But lately I'll choose a route without tolls and while driving the directions change to the toll route. It's very confusing and could be dangerous because you're already driving.
"Android Auto integration is rubbish. It never seems to be able to be opened from where auto, you need to load it before which seems absolutely ridiculous. Won't change route automatically to reduce journey time. Only good for police locations reporting etc."
"Ever since I upgraded to Android 13, Waze's display will freeze while using Android Auto. Disconnecting / Reconnecting may give a minute or so of regular use before it freezes again. My only option at this time is to either use Google Maps on Android Auto or I simply use Waze while not using Android Auto. I am using a Pixel 6 Pro."
"It has stopped working properly on Android Auto. Alerts never leave the screen. I won't be able to know about if there's a pothole ahead, for example, because the speed radar I passed by 10 minutes ago is still showing on the Alert display."
"Had no problem with the app when I would connect to Apple CarPlay, but on Android Auto it's a disaster. App does not work, constantly freezing on screen and not responding when connected to Android Auto. Once I disconnect from Android Auto, it works fine."
New glitch were pop ups are staying on screen. Like when going across rail way tracks or a red-light camera it stays on the screen until you come to another pop up. Hope this can be fix soon. Other than that it's great.
"I'm using Waze on Android Auto, but since the update it started freezing after the average speed check notification. The notification does not disappear after you pass the speed camera. Also when the speed limit is exceeded the circle appears only as a quarter circle."
We love the app but it could be improved if you were able to switch between highways and non-higways. It is difficult to make the transition because you have to disconnect android auto to make the change.
After the most recent update when you begin to drive and it shows the first speed or red light camera on your route without a destination programmed the camera notification freezes and doesn't refresh to show any other ones on the road and this only started happening after this last update sometime in November 2022 hopefully you guys can fix it your app is a great tool for driving
"Stop routing me to further distance when there's a way shorter way. Also, stop taking me to all construction site and a broken road. I really to feel this app is useless as Google map It was shown as construction on waze and hazard. At the end I took the highway and it was very smooth that I'm concerning why doesn't waze suggest at the first place?"
"Great app and love the features. The only thing I wish it had was a UI enhancement to have quick selections for hazards, police, object on road, etc. To make it easier to select without having to choose through a bunch of stuff."
"Great tool, if only it showed a simplified view and allowed more room for the actual speed when a larger font is selected and speed is in km/h (when above 100, if going over speed limit, speed sign covers last digit). Larger font also makes keyboard cover list of destinations."
"Used the app for quite some years. Always worked great, including use with Android Auto. Since the last update speed traps and average speed check zones remain on the Android Auto screen and future notifications about speed traps do not appear."
"Navigation was a nightmare... Sometimes it doesn't show properly which road to use ... and some roads are not displayed on the map ... ""Use the right road"" but which ""right road""!? Got me stuck on the highway which ""U"" turns are 30 minutes away ... Waze sometimes takes me on a wild goose case instade on the direct path ... It can't differenciate motorcycle from car ... expecting the bike to take the path way of a car ... When the bike can easily correct it's path without making a big diture ..."
"I really used to like this app but lately they have been working on different roads in my city and although I report road closures, Waze still tries to take me down that road! 8 out of 10 times it has taken me down the wrong road lately. I also wish I could take off those candy noises because they are distracting."
"When trying to use this with the latest Android Auto, the app simply produces a black screen and crashes Android Auto. It's non-functional with Android Auto. ***Aug 2022 update*** It became fully functional again for a few weeks in July, and now no longer works as per my previous review. ***Sept 2022 update*** The black screen is still all that occurs when attempting to use via Android Auto... ***November 2022 update*** The black screen still comes up. Conclusion: Waze does not work with Android"
"NO ALERT FOR A SPEED CAMERA. I was driving and expecting audio warning. and got nothing besides a visual warning, which is useless. alert are on and not muted. is this because i was going below speed limit??? if yes then this is BS cause had i not known about the trap i would have accelerated!!!! 1. while in navigation it takes 7 clicks to go from 2D to 3D. why?? 2. manual scaling is painful, give me two separate buttons (+) and (-) 3. Please default to map view when choosing route!"
Good for police and red lights/speed cameras however arrival time is almost never accurate even if you plan in advance and especially in traffic. It's really annoying that the time will change 15-20+ mins while driving to a destination almost every time. They should really look into that
"Mystery meat navigation, no way to set preferred route, no assistance whatsoever in using the app, super clunky. *edit* Added two stars because I figured it how to change the route to my location. Still clunky and difficult to use"
"I used to love Android auto but lately all I get is frozen screens and constant drop outs, particularly when I use Waze. Voice commands with Google work one day and not the next. Very frustrating. Some help would be appreciated."
"I love Waze and use it on daily basis with Android Auto. However with recent update It has been naging me, after every address sent by another app to waze, with a white pop up that waze is connected to Android Auto and I should check my car display. Please remove this or add an option to turn it off. Thanks"
"Super useful and is in my opinion the best nav app to have. The only thing I wish I could do is have different options for transportation like on Google maps where I can choose walking, bus, train, etc. But overall amazing"
"In towns it always gets me into narrow back roads, where I waste much more time than going on the main road (no, there was no traffic on the main road). The latest example was in Codlea, but it occurs practically anywhere. Also, Hungarian instructions are a joke."
"The input items are still to hard to input while driving. Many are not specific enough for quick input. Good app, but still-lacking after the past 4 years. Not enough growth. Who cares about childish voices? Focus on driving should override."
"I like this app. Only a few times has it acted bonkers. Lol But the next update fixed the problem. And the features are great. July 9 2022, This app has been acting poorly. Really bad directions. Hope this new update will fix the problems. If not my rating will go down. New phone and this app is acting funny again. Traffic is constantly trying to update, but only gets to 22% 11/23/22"
"Ever since an update which was 2 previous before the latest one, it constantly closes no matter the phone or app settings. Had no problems with it whatsoever until that one. Now I'm constantly having to open the app back up again which is incredibly annoying"
It's the best travel map I have ever seen/used it warned you if a car is broke down on the side of the road. What to look out for. It really takes care of you and looks out for any problem you mite have and try to help you in advance. It is excellent. I highly recommend it.
"You are the cause of accidents and congestion on major highways. Folks are spending more time tapping their phone screen to score useless Achievement Points or to answer stupid questions about hazards along their route than they do concentrating on the chaotic activity around them. Also, the app lacks a setting which truck drivers can enable to help us avoid weight restricted roads."
This apps always stop functioning while I was driving and I had to stop at random places to restart but it just won't work. Need to reinstall the app so it can work normally but it won't last long either. I always ended up using Google map.
Installed app. It asked for email verification. Don't have gmail so had to leave app to look at email to get code. Found email and verification link had expired. Uninstalled waze and reinstalled. Same thing happened. Could not find waze icon so have to open it in google pllay store. Do not like this.
"I used to use Waze before switching to Google Maps. I decided to try Waze again because I like the crowd-sourced alerts. For the most part, it works pretty well, but it has a tendency to freeze up from time to time, so it loses a star for that."
Japan maps not showing. Too many social (+5) notifications interrupting my music and podcasts. There is no setting to turn those off without also turning off important alerts. All notifications should come through narrow channels and all notifications should be mute-able.
Sucks..can't answer a call in the car with waze running. Tell it an address and still have to verify that's where you want to go 3 times before getting directions. I like that you can report stuff but would be cool if could voice report instead of having to be distracted to report
Waze has been the best app since I found out about it Iv put so meany of my mates on it who think it's a good app. BUT... lately it hasn't been working saying saying GPS approximately loading and it won't work properly IV tryed installing it and re installing it a couple times and it still isn't working right
"It was the perfect map, but few month ago it started freezing during drive every 5 seconds, I was waiting for an update to solve this issue but didn't see any. This problem happens with all wazer that I know"
"Eliran_Close_Intent to close Waze via Tasker no longer works, please fix. The suggestion to have an integrated music player like poweramp has been around since 2018 yet STILL hasn't been added. So much for the feedback.."
This app doesnt work well as before. Got me to go a super long way. My GPS is working well. So the problem lies with the app. Waze is really bad. Keep showing long routes and waste of time.
"Absolutely love this app! Only problem encountered is the voice changes on me sometimes. Also instead of saying ""approaching a railroad crossing "", it says ""approaching a level crossing ""."
"Fantastic app and concept. Thanks for offering it and I'm looking forward to all future improvements and potential capabilities. However, I'm a truck driver here in Victoria Australia. Our roads have been battered by wild whether this season, it's such a shame that reporting is strictly limited to so few reports per day. I can genuinely reach my account quota well within the first half hour behind the wheel."
Used to be a great App and well worth 5 stars but has become poor due to not always connecting to GPS or loading the route but then doesn't track you. You just sit stationary on screen. Switched back to Google Maps as at least it always tracks me.
"Best of the rest! Still work to be done (sometimes a little unresponsive), but still faster & more accurate than other navigators out there. The others can't compete. My go to navigation atm."
"It very nice app. But I cannot find the way to be able to open links of address from maps share directly to Waze. Seem that from android 12 there is no chance to change navigation app by default, always it opens to maps. I got OnePlus 9"
Thie is the best navigation app. I use it sometimes driving for work. It would be really cool if you guys implemented a dual account option so I could switch between work and personal accounts. I love this app.
"The only app I use, but it stopped connecting to my Amazon Music account. It makes me open it separately which is fine, just less convenient. Not sure what changed or why. It's been like this a month or more."
12.21.22- Why does Waze mute my text message notifications when it's connected to Android auto? üëéüèº Not very helpful. I have turned on notifications settings again. I'm not sure how many times I will have to go through this before this issue gets fixed.
Can't think of another navigation app that sucks more than Waze. There is no option to select routes and the default routing chooses the shittiest possible road. For example from Brno to Arad it gives me 8.5 hours when a normal drive takes under 6.
"Useful app but horrible cartoon-like interface. It's like watching anime for small kids. I would love to have an option to choose between different more sober, serious interfaces similar to Google maps."
"Very disappointed, need to see suggested route PRIOR to driving. App doesn't want to accommodate me. I hate last min surprise directions, that's why I wanted waze. I Will have to break out a paper map to see basic route first."
"Thank you for making our lives easier. I have a slight issue on my Honor 20 Pro- the sound for ""70s DJ"" is pretty soft even though I have it at max volume in the app and on my phone. Is there a way you could increase the loudness for your voice navigation in your next update? The slider looks limited too. Thanks üëç"
The double navigation voices are becoming annoying. Sometimes the two voices repeat the same thing. This has been going on for a few months now!
"What have you done? Since a couple of months it has become useless. Puting an address with house number brings me hundreds of meters away from the destination and @ the wrong side if the road. However, a big progress has been made when coming to show adds Looking for an alternative now."
"Issue with police and speed camera alerts do not go away automatically. I have to remove them. If I leave it, I get no more alerts on the next. This is dangerous as I am constantly adjusting. Please please sort this out immediately. I love Waze but this is starting to sour me"
Too many bugs since the last 3 updates. Speedometer/speed limit keeps disappearing after 10-15 mins of use. Forcing me to reconnect Android Auto. I have used this app for 2 years on Android Auto in same vehicle. I drive for Living therefore use it daily for 9-12 hours.
"The app used to work just fine. Now I cannot plan a drive. It keeps on saying ""Route too long. Recalculating with new arrival day."" The route is calculated only around 100km. Is that too long...?"
Brilliant app. Nuff said! Just a suggestion. Please don't use feet as a distance to a turn - use yards instead. I find it way easier to visualize 300 yards to 1000 feet. This is in no way a critism I think the app is magic - but the use of feet is definitely an uninvited niggle
"Will update if things change but Waze took me down the worst route possible home today. Maps told me to avoid that area but I thought to myself, I heard Waze redirects you when it finds a better route. So I went with it. None of that happened. Right. Into. Heart of traffic. Actually didn't even show any traffic on that Street. Rush hour where they have been digging up the road for months now... Waze said clear skies. Also, everyone (even at midnight on all highways) driving 40km/h"
"Recently, about 3 weeks ago, Waze maps have been giving not precise & accuracy route to me anymore..! It just that i have just downloaded this Waze navigation maps & started to navigate on the roads of Singapore. 1 of my friends also said that Waze Maps are 1 of the navigation maps can't truse anymore...it was all very good & precise accuracy of the time i used it..! Now, it won't guide us drivers to take a shorter route, even though i have did all the necessary general adjustment on Waze Map."
Love the app. Very precise navigation. It even shows the lanes. The only negative thing is that sometimes it chooses the longer route (google maps does the same and more often)
I loved this app until the apple music stopped working and I got a tic for phone in hand for switching apps to play my music!!!! Which was the WHOLE point! Thanks a lot Waze üò©
"This app could be perfect when compared to others, paid and free, and all it needs is for you to firstly, add road speed limits constantly, not just showing when you go over it. Then also move the speedometer placement so it is never covered by navigation directions. I don't have a digital speedometer in my car so that would be really helpful, and every other app does this without having all your amazing features. Thanks."
"Could have been better. Navigating from a city I rarely head to with work, I used to just use Google maps. So using Waze I figured it would be much better. It gave me 3 options. I selected one that added 10 minutes, but a route I knew would be faster on paper. I stopped for fuel, got in the car and began driving, it changed my route whilst filling up and lead me into a huge delay. If I knew the roads better I'd have ignored it. Poor service. I didn't expect it. Perhaps it's a bug? Debug sent."
"Would be a great app but it freezes and doesn't know where you are then gives you false directions, leading you to make a U-turn when you are going the correct way. Allot of people say this so why has it not been fixed? Another issue is that it makes you watch a stupidly long video for the editor in 1 sitting. Let me watch in parts!! If it worked it would be the best GPS app out there. It's speed limits are kept updated and it has speed camera locations. And the map is updated aswell."
"Ever since the last update, it has stopped working at all with Android Auto. The app runs just fine by itself, but when you plug your device to a car via the USB port and open it up on Android Auto, your little car just sits there on screen, never moving, never going anywhere. Tested it out on three different cars with two different devices, so the problem must be in the app itself."
"Super app. Would be great if future development could consider adjusting the zoom level, either by zooming out a lot more on long roads or by being able to customize it. My other nav app zooms out a lot more when my next turn is a long distance away (like over 5km). This combined with the level of detail on the map (names of cities, roads etc...) makes that one has a better overview of where you are while driving."
"A very nice app but it could be better ! For example to select a round trip. Or when you add a stop, how to remove it during the journey. Easy way to mark a wrong turn (for example in some cities the turn is only for emergency vehicles) or wrong direction (the street changed); Thank you I've been with you almost 10 years."
"Overall for me it's a very good app. However, when I've finished using the app, and I use it a lot for work purposes and I open the app the following day there is no voice for the navigation. I check the volume controls and everything is as I've left them. I then have to uninstall the app and re-install it and log back in and everything works OK. Waze, why is this happening as it is almost a daily scenario? Kind regards."
"I've been using Waze for years. Unfortunately, since around beginning of August 2022, it randomly pauses navigation on Android Auto. The location just stops updating (even though I'm driving). It can be stuck on turn left in 2 miles, but that was 6 miles ago.... Lots of friends have also started experiencing this. Unfortunately the support team just give instructions on submitting bug reports etc, but it is very difficult to do whilst driving! Please fix this, I can't use Waze until fixed!"
"I used Waze fo a few years now. A very good app, constantly evolving and improving over time. It is a bit difficult to add reports on few occasions. However, recently it's got a big bug. It's restarting the phone after 10 minutes of using the app. I tried to clear the cache, all data, uninstall and reinstall it, but it's doing the same. It's forcing the phone to restart after 10 minutes. I know this was an issue on older versions years ago, that was fixed. But now it's back again."
"Waze is a good gps and route planning tool. That been said the ETA in it is medicore at best. Many times it can add up to 45 minutes in a single trip,. Repeatedly - the algorithm doesn't recalculate based on previous trips. Or at least not as it should. In addition there are high loading time compared to Google maps. It also takes more battery to operate."
"Since last update started to present issues when connected to the car with Android Auto. It is very annoying because always shows the vehicle in a position delayed to the real one. Already lost some entries and had to reroute because of that. Tested with other routing apps that didn't presented this issue. Even put both working at the same time and Waze stucked after some time and the other continued ok. If not connected, seems to run fine, but the objective is to use it with the car, right?"
"This app used to be great, now? it's virtually unusable. So many people have mentioned the faults when used with Android Auto. All you ever see is ""send a bug report"" Just how are we meant to do this when we're driving? It's such a common issue, surely you can reproduce it? When it does get an update, its some trivial enhancement and never does it say the interface with Andriod Auto has been fixed . Crashes every journey. Constantly loses GPS position and shows you're not moving when you are."
There's nothing like it! I will say tho this psst update has been causing freezing on alerts where it won't update or go away. Also the map is zoomed out a bit too much causing wrong turns.
"Excellent app on many fronts. Tends to get ""confused"" when exiting parking lots, repeating conflicting directions in rapid fire manner. Otherwise, very helpful."
"Love it... suits my desire to hear what's coming in advance for me to pay more attention to the possibility of noticing the intersection. Then, just before I make the turn...I get the message. I've got say...I wonder why I'm taken to off-track situations some of the time? Seems a little too circuitous... I'd appreciate less circularity! ;-)"
"Was working just fine till the latest update, it's way off on where speed cameras are and the notification won't disappear after you pass the camera. Also the maps disappear as you drive so the display goes blank."
"Very good... when it works. This is the best navigation app when it is working, but it has too many glitches and problems. Occasionally shuts down whilst I'm driving and quite often I have to open it twice to get any life out of it (it will just sit ""looking for routes"". Have to close it an reopen it and then it will actually find the route and begin). Frustrating because it is so very good when it is working."
"Since the update, it seems to not recognize other, easier, less traffic routes. I've notice it doesn't allow you to suggest other routes until you drive the route to make the app reroute your destination."
"Its not a bad app ,but could yall create an option to put into the GPS if you're in an 18-wheeler w/ an trailer attached vs. a personal vehicle to create the safest path of travel??? We will be very grateful for that!!!"
"What's happening with waze lately my map position keeps freezing and when you come to a stop it then catches up with your correct position, google maps and Tom Tom work perfectly. Replaced lead reinstalled update version and still GPS lagging behind, been dealing with waze support getting no where."
"Same issue as a few people with the notification freezing and then get no further updates after. Goes for everything. Cameras, police, debris, cars on side of the road. Using a samsung note 22. No issues until latest update. Pls fix."
"Love app - but I'd like to HAVE 3 things. Stop directing me into CLOSED ROADS, steep slopes in SNOW, and let me ""report"" an issue when Waze is in ""landscape mode"" Please try to take on one of these issues. Loved Waze since way before you were bought up - when improvements and fixes SEEMED to come alot more frequently than they do now you're owned by GOOGLE?"
"on samsung s22 ultra the app is buuged.if you are using waze and switch to other app and come back, the portion pf map is missing.support is useless. they told me it is a bug they re aware of but can t do anything :)).i even semt em video"
"Just recently, I've noticed that the alert notifications (i.e. Red Light Cameras, Speed Cameras, Hazard Ahead - Vehicle Stopped, Police Ahead, RR crossing,etc.) won't leave my screen after I have passed it. I have to manually remove by creating an alert so it will clear the notification."
"I want to like water so bad, but it's just not that good. The android auto integration is terrible. The voice commands brings up a whole list of places you don't want to go, forcing you to scroll to the bottom of the page and find the address you're looking for, defeating the whole purpose of voice command. Even then it only takes you to the street and not the exact address. And then it lags all the time. I find myself going back to google maps time and time again because it just works."
"Up until recently it's the best sat nav app I've used, but on android auto when ever I used to clear a speed camera it would automatically clear it off of my screen. Whereas now it doesn't and I have to manually do it taking my hands and eyes off of the road which is very dangerous."
"Consolidate your dumb passes so that you don't have to manually search and add 27 passes for a country where you have a vignette for all the roads. Clean up your list from toll road name entries such as ""13523523#%$&^$%^"". We wasted 1h 20min because of this and didn't realize it until it was too late. Provide at the very least an override for ignoring toll road warnings and re-routes outright."
"The voice keeps changing and is annoying. It's high-pitched, then low pitched on my android and on my iPhone. Both phones have the latest software, and the app is updated."
"Edit + removed a star for this. The search function on Android auto is useless and terrible. I will say the specific street name and suburb and instead of taking me straight there like google maps, it returns a list of random places with some nearby. It's DANGEROUS at worst and annoying at best to scroll through the results or have to input it before moving. FIX THIS, it's the ONLY thing holding you back from being able to replace Google maps."
The zone icons don't disappear anymore meaning Red light camera speed camera zone etc stay on and don't warn you of the next warning. Google 's vaunted customer service support and tech is mediocre at best. I complained 3 times with no results. Oh well...
Great when it worked. App has been basically useless using my pixel 6 pro with Android Auto on Ford Sync3 over the last couple months with all the latest updates. Google maps is working without any issues.
Waze is brilliant except you cannot set it to suit your vehicle. It has taken me down lanes only suitable for off road vehicles in my camper but I've always managed to get out. Re traffic and hazards on the road it's excellent.
In Android auto when the voice guidance gives a driving instruction it turns down the music playing and it stays down after the voice guidance is over. Only Waze does this. Google maps returns music to previous volume level
"Absolutely love this app over all other navigation apps. However, the volume is not loud enough in the app., even my phone volume is turned completely up. Is there a way to increase the volume in you app.?"
"Worst experience today. Been using Waze , today the location is 310195 brought me to expressway showing wrong location. To add to the disappointment, to punggol should go via TPE, instead direct to CTE/TPE huge traffic jam. Please fix your app GPS and navigation!"
"It was a good service but anymore. * Constantly is unable to calculate a route: ""No routes found"" * Constantly advising routes with all sorts of incidents: flood, big crashes, constructions and so on."
Constant crashing and insane load times. Had auto updates turned off for years then figured i would update see if any new cool features just destroyed the app. Going to roll back.
"This was my go-to app when driving and using Android Auto. However recently it's been unusable - my location 'freezes' whilst driving. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and other attempts to fix with no luck. I've had to revert back to Google maps and that is working fine, indicating not a phone or Android Auto issue, but a Waze app issue."
"Does not working properly in Israel. Show the falce ways, i have two devices in the car. They give me different routs, diff. time and one lies about heavy traffic. Make a lot of mistakes. For train stations give the destination not inside pickup area, but always on highway close to the station. Very often send to the traffic jam without show it on the map. Give the driver to go a longest way around the city, sometimes up to 15 km extra. To choose parameters of rout is now impossible. Very bad!"
"If you use wireless Android auto you will have to switch to Google maps, as this app will not track GPS movement consistently over Wi-Fi Android auto. Your GPS position will constantly freeze and then update at random times and you will miss every important turn."
"2 issues: connection will randomly break and it only works again after closing and opening the app again; pop ups are annoying and lack sense, how am I supposed to know/confirm there's a construction site 4 km ahead when I'm stuck in traffic?"
"Nothing compared to Google Maps: no walking digressions so one way streets mean Waze find you all around in circles!!! That hurt,!! Nobusiness listing like Maps with all the reviews and photos and other excellent information. Waze needs to step up or go away"
"EDIT: Latest update is a huge bust. Please either roll back the update or fix the bugs! Since the last upgrade, I have had issues with being able to connect to the route server. Fix this and I'll change my rating!!"
Having issues with map not moving as I move. Map will get stuck in the same spot when navigating and can only get location to change by cancelling navigation. Pixel 7.
"All the right functionality, just hate the way it looks. Wish it could be less challenging and in your face, like Google maps navigation."
"The crowd source function of the application is great however, unlike other navigation applications, it does not take time zones into account and does not remain open while using other applications. Fix that and it's 5 star!"
"Since the last update, I have problems with Android car, it show me the route and get stuck on that and when I drive still on the same position where I started the route. But if I use without Android Car works fine."
"Speed camera notifications do not go off after passing it. Cos of the notification starts, they did not seem to be able to trigger the subsequent notifications. Did not used to be like that."
"Doesn't work with android auto. Voice navigation is terrible. Half the time it only gives the first part of the direction before cutting off. Ie: ""in 100 feet turn."" Turn where? In what direction?"
"Latest update messed the app completely. There is no option to pick the best time to go anymore to avoid traffic. Navigation isn not working properly in Israel, I feel it takes me in circles and makes the route longer intentionally. Showing me all the routes every time I start a new drive is very annoying, just give me the fastest by default and I will check the routes out if I need to, like it used to be. Takes extra time to start navigation..."
"Hi all, I've used this mapping a few times now it's very good. I use Garmin, Google & other mapping apps. Waze is one of the best I've used in a long time, if it wasn't for the mapping voice telling me that there was a car broken down and the side of the bypass I could have had a serious accident on my motorbike. Do you do mapping in Florida USA. Thanks for your mapping."
"Best navigation app out there. Does have issues every now & then, but it's nothing that can be controlled since it's mainly due to location. Overall, I love it."
"After latest updates not able to run waze app with location disabled anymore, only option is to enable it or shut down. Please give back option to run the app and browse the map without location enabled."
"Used to love this app, but lately its choice of routes has been very poor. It manages to pick a route that takes you through a smaller (slower) road rather than highway when you don't want, or it picks the highway when it's not necessary. Maps has gotten much better at picking routes than Waze now, and it's sad to see this happen."
"Good, but speed camera notices get stuck on screen on latest version of Waze and Android Auto after you have driven past. You have to bring up an additional menu and back out and then it fixes"
"Used to be good, now it is probably the worst GPS application ever. Optimizing doesn't make sense, real time routing is no more efficient nor accurate. And I'm not mentioning the advertisement that is ridiculous. Avoid at all cost."
Very faulty as of alate. - Cannot find nearest petrol stations due to errors - Huge delays in planning the journey in app compared to before - Total app errors that prevents me from using sometimes When it works as it should it is still the best navigation app.
"For ages, it has been great but in the last few days, it has developed an issue when running on Android Auto in that my position just stops dead. I can switch it between Google Maps and Waze and Waze will work again for only a few seconds until it just stops again. I am now having to use Google Maps whilst driving which is a total pain. Also, something I have always meant to ask is why does the App running via Android Auto not have full functionality? Always seemed a bit odd."
"Hello, I'm using Waze for last 4-5 years. Before it was great app, now it has some glitches. Recent one is after passing speed camera the warning stays on the screen and I have to cancel trip and start again on the way."
It would be really great if there was some type of updates to the vehicles as I also have an RV. And I'm unsure if the roads that this is taking me on will work for my motorized home. I have been stuck in some places because of where Waze has taken me. Please update this in your app.
"Overall great, now with new quirk. With the latest update, Waze doesn't want to run the same account on two devices simultaneously anymore. This is extremely annoying for my wife and I who have an extensive list of shared Favorites."
I use this app everyday now however it appears to be giving my oled phone screen led burn in. I know other apps that can refresh or adjust the image to prevent burn in. I see a silhouette of the post comment hazard notification icon on my screen all the time now. Google maps never did this and I used it for years on many devices.
Waze was my go to app for navigation in Android Auto. After the latest update the app freezes and sometimes starts again only to freeze. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app with no success. I have had to revert to Google maps which has no issues. Has happened across 3 different vehicles so I know it it the app that is the issue. Please just fix it and put it back to normal!!!!
"I mostly like Waze but I only have a really small thing I'd like to see added to its design. Both Google Maps and Apple Maps (on iOS) will let the map use the whole screen including the notification area on all screen phones. On Waze, it just has a black background unlike on Google Maps where it is transparent and the icons are ovelayed directly over the map. Not a huge deal breaker, but less aestechtically pleasing, and I'd like to see the map use the whole top of the screen."
"The app does not provide live traffic updates as like Google maps, however the interface yes is quite impressive. Moreover the speed cam detection and speed limit alert is really helpful."
"It's nice to be able to see where construction is taking place, where accidents are at, and where speed traps are sitting. I use this app when traveling out of town. Makes it a smoother trip for us."
"I was told this is Google maps on steroids... Problem is, it can't get as far as to establish a route, let alone provide guidance. Waze cannot connect to the GPS no matter what, even though Google maps works flawlessly."
Usually works great. Has been pretty glitchy with android auto lately. No speedometer and alerts don't dissappear after you pass them. Pretty annoying.
I use to love using Waze and recommend it to everyone but lately it has become unusable. 50% of the time it works with my Android Auto. The rest it freezes and doesn't show my location. Very intermittent and un reliable. I have used this app for years now and it has only in the last couple months since the app has updated it barely works. Please Waze return to whatever it was before because that was great !
Please allow the 'Where to' and 'My Waze' bars to be minimised. They take up half the screen when in landscape mode and provide no benefit. Don't know why this hasn't been addressed as yet - it is such a bad aesthetic design flaw.
"I like Waze. I wish they change when connected to the car, it only tells me now the st/highway name if it's set to a destination on Android Auto. Also enable to add a stop while while on Android auto is on especially when the the car is on park."
Inexplicably doesn't work in the usa. It loads without the address bar and can't keep a location. Literally useless. Google is full of people searching for why and useless faq answers about installation errors. Jokes.
The greatest navigation app. Easy to manage music and stay focused on the road. No annoying popups to make you rear end someone. would recommend to anyone who drives
"It takes a long route, takes you to a wrong entrance and on 3 different occasions it take you to a previous location, I'm a taxi driver and I depend on waze while driving and it takes me to a previous location. Please rectify this issue."
"This app has gotten worst. It's taking me long routes and a roads that has been shut off for a year that leads into a blocked construction site in Canary wharf. I only use this app to avoid the LTNs to do my courier app. If there was another social gps app out there that I can use that does the same to avoid LTNs, then I will definitely use it üò°"
"Unusable recently (few month ago) the app started to avoid the navigation. It shows me the route, I click start drive and then it gets back to route again. Not using the app for now, hopefully you will resolve it."
"Indicate traffic ahead, make lane change more noticeable and make the view a little closer so one can easily notice the lanes, also make road speed limit always visible on screen. The app seems quite good."
"Me likey. Not perfect by any means but it's easy enough to find the answers with support or on the web. I'd like to eventually use it on Android Auto as opposed to my S9. The Scoreboard applies to States so doesn't clarify what it means for Canadian users. Also, the preferred fuel sometimes reverts from Premium to Regular in error. Thankfully customer support has been quick on it and gave me instructions to report it using Debug Mode."
"Waze is the best and my favourite navigation app. I love the traffic alerts and waze will navigate around it. Same with alerts for police and hazards. But to give it 5 stars I would need it to have the ability to turn off voice prompts entirely, as turning the volume down on voice still makes my music quiet when it's ""speaking"" even though it's volume is low enough to be considered muted. Other then this the app is awesome!"
"Overall 100 out of 100, but please sort out the blackness on the samsung s22 ultra the map doesn't fully load often is blank with an arrow in the middle and the street names. I've missed my turn a few times tonight."
The app has glitches...Sometimes when the voice speaks it just changes to another voice. Otherwise it works as it should but it could do with alot of improvements.
"I had a wonderful experience browsing this GPS navigation system app i can find near by fast food restaurants, traffic reports, police locations, highway patrolman's locations bad weather conditions reroute if need too i really like this app a lot."
"Not entirely Waze's fault but the lack of an offline mode, coupled with the terrible connectivity issues on the Pixel 6 pro and its defective antenna in areas of low signal. This means that if you take a wrong turn the whole app will crash when it tries to recalculate a new route when there is no signal. Pity because there was a lot I liked about Waze but it's just too dangerous to have a crashing satnav app in an area of no signal where it might be hard to park up in a safe place."
"App was good until the latest update. When using Android Auto, going past a fixed speed camera the notification stays on the screen. Won't disappear unless I remove and install cable to the phone"
2 months later this app is worse than ever.....it actively finds traffic for me. AVOID!!! 01/08 This used to be the Go-to navigation app; the best!! It most definitely isn't any more. It seems to find traffic more often than avoid it. The routes it chooses befuddle and frustrate. I'm told that the problems started once Waze was bought by Google and the poor perfomamce is a deliberate attempt to make people switch to Google Maps....not sure if true but it's working!!
"The warnings on the left hand side of the screen do not clear once you have passed them (for example speed camera warning stays on permanently even after you have passed it, it used to clear by itself)"
"Please enable to feature of showing the maps and directions on lock screen like how Google map does it. In Google maps, during navigation, when the screen is lock, and subsequently unlocked, it doesn't require a password or biometric authentication and will still show the maps and directions. It helps me when I'm driving so that at some stretch of the road, I don't need the screen to be on all the time. Waze, please implement this feature."
"I understand this app is based on user input, but I dislike when traffic doesn't display. I was traveling thru DC this weekend in gridlock traffic, no traffic icons were displaying, but plenty of cops, disabled vehicles, or construction. Had to go to Google Maps for traffic guidance."
I have used waze for years now and found it the best navigation app around. Recently in through my android car play the app has started to Lagg behind (freezing and then catching up 30 second/1 minute later) to the point its becoming unusable. I have uninstalled the app and installed again but this hasn't solved the problem. If they could sort the problem I would definitely go back to the app but with the lagging issue it's become unusable
Used Waze for the first time in years and didn't remember all the ads. Can't believe they say it is user content driving the accuracy but make you accept the ads. Typical. Uninstalled Waze as a worthless app.
"For driving on the interstate, Waze is far superior to its counterpart Google Maps. The ability to flag hazards and speed traps, powered by a legion of volunteers and a large community, is what sets Waze apart. Now that Google is merging Waze with the Maps team, I hope that this excellent product does not succumb to Google's Graveyard."
"Have uses waze religiously for my job as I drive around a lot. However, in the past month,itl crash and lag out of the blue on android auto, making it impossible to use and also very dangerous and distracting. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app about 8 times, cleared cache, cleared data and also uninstalled and reinstalled android auto itself. I'm so dissappointed as these maps are so much more useful than Google, with better route options, less annoying and has updates. Its unusable.."
"Great app that navigates accurately and has current information on traffic, hazards etc. Works well on Android Auto too. I just wish the options for the car icon were better - I'd like to customise my vehicle but I stick with the default arrow as I struggle to see which end is the front on all of the other fun options. I'd also like to be able to set the map display to match the conventional UK roadmap theme of blue motorways, green major routes, red A-roads, yellow B-roads and white minor roads"
"I've had to amend my 5 star rating, This app has gone down hill, it takes you on some random routes, often not even the shortest or quickest. Waze has had its time unfortunately."
"Used to work great but now every time I go past a RR x-ing the RR x-ing notification stays on the screen and doesn't go away until I select ""end drive"" and start the route over again. Pretty annoying"
"The update of this app or not working fine, pls bring back the last version, this updated one is not working fine, latest version not working fine, not showing forward.when using the app, It's not giving directions showing the arrow moving forward on the screen, or screen not turn front ward."
Can you please Put back the option for 2 devices to access the same account Instead of kicking you off one of them. Many people that are couriers or utilize the vehicle from destination to destination use 1 for directions to their location and will use another 1 To see how far the next location is.
"This may be very small however this is very significant to me, I like Google Maps, because of the way Google Maps announces your directions, it will actually name the name of the turn, whereas Waze, doesn't do that, unless its in my settings"
The mobile app does show alternative routes. Navigate you through longest route. I prefer to have choices. I can choose longer route or quickest which works best for me.
"One if the worst navigation apps around. Continually recalculated route, got me in an entirely different area than I was traveling to. Will not use again."
"This was my daily go to app. But the last week the app freezes on my cars display via Android Auto. It had been working fine, no settings had changed. The app works fine without being connected to Android Auto. All other apps work fine when connected to Android Auto. I've deleted cache, memory from both apps, rebooted phone, read forums. I can not find a solution."
"Was my go to but back to Google Maps now. No matter what I do, I choose to go toll free on my route to work (yes, i choose avoid tolls) and it constantly gives me only toll options and always re routes me on the drive to take a toll road. Used to work fine up until a couple of weeks ago. I re-installed and it worked for the first couple of trips then back to this. Super annoying"
"While using waze with android auto, some times (most of the times) it loses connectivity - so I'm not seeing the ETA nor other available routes. I do have internet access because other apps works just fine."
"Until recently, it was my SatNav, and had been for years (despite the speedometer intermittently disappearing), but now, it's unusable. There's 10+ seconds of lag on a regular basis, so when driving in a built up area, it's literally pointless. It's a known issue (see their forums), across Android and iOS."
"Been using Waze for years now and never had a problem, up until the recent update where the app will now freeze when connected to android Auto in my car when the screen on my mobile phone turns off. When I press a button to activate the screen (no requirement to unlock, just screen activation) Waze starts working again. Unfortunately, until this is fixed, I will have to use another app."
"Love Waze. The reports etc are very useful, only sometimes the app doesn't give me the option to confirm a report (say it's there or not), and even though I'm above baby rank I can't beep other cars. It's greyed out. Other than that, it's a great app"
"I have been using waze for a long time, recently I would say in the last week or so it doesn't alert me to the speed cameras or police reported ahead. Is waze no longer supporting this feature. This is why I'm giving it a 4 star. Is anyone else having same problem?"
"Not Good. Not keeping up when driving app always running behind, does catch up to driving till stop or till you've driven several miles. Lost confidence in waze won't using till I see corrections have been made."
Waze is pretty good at directing you efficiently. I just wish the zoom button was always visible when running Waze via android auto so you can see traffic etc up ahead to a greater degree.
"Bad review because I can't ever find out the distance between 2 locations without my location. What if I want to find out the travel distance, routes, and time between New York and California while I live in Florida? Why, because I want to plan a trip and this app never let's me. Unless its been days without use that has forgotten my location. This is ridiculous. Change that already. It's so frustrating."
"Waze does not adjust eta for time zone at destination. Started in Texas, with a trip to FL. Stopped in Mississippi for the night. Started out next day. Waze said we arrive at 7pm. Let everyone know. Dinner will be ready at 7. Nope. Between traffic and time change we did not arrive until 9pm. Not knowing we end up in eastern time zone seems pretty dumb."
"Does ok, it lets me listen to radio at same time as the apps voice with volume control for each, that what i like about the app, and if its wrong theres a place to edit the apps maps."
"On screen notifications no longer disappear, preventing new notifications from appearing. This has started to happen since the latest version of the app was updated."
"Loved the app (past tense). Ever since moving to The Google Pixel 7, nothing but problems. If this can't be fixed soon, I may go find an alternative solution."
"Gets me to where I want to go but the incessant ads are distracting and annoying. Also, unlike my built in car gps, Waze doesn't give me optional routes to select from."
"The points (blue hexagon with a heart symbol) is extremely annoying and distracting while driving, please remove it or at least guide me how to disable it. It has no added-value at all."
"Helpful app but also drives my crazy every time. UX is so bad in some details, long list of tols, laggy slow map, useless sound when I approve report which just drop my music, too many icons if I want to report something. But my favorite ones are when app just change my route without asking, navigating me through bumpy road. I had low gas tank level but waze shows only promoted gas stations which are far away even there's close one !!!! Switching to google maps, reports are only good feature."
Slow! I like how it knows where there's construction & closed roads but often it is slow on directions. It doesn't recognize where I'm at til 30 seconds late. Tells me to turn after I either missed the turn or after I already turned.
"App used to work great on Android auto, one day it just stopped being good, freezes constantly mid journey and then jumps to your current location a few minutes later, then freezes again, etc, etc. Reinstalled app multiple times, re connected car, restarted phone. Occasionally it works, shame really as i used to live by it!!!"
"Excellent , the best nav app I've used. The UI is clear, the map is nice and UNCLUTTERED (this is so important) . Only the main route selected stands out with minimal stuff around it. I really appreciate this neat uncluttered look. The voice navigation is clear and precise. I just wish it was a bit louder. Even on max volume it's a bit faint. Well done devs."
"When I use other app to find place I want to go to and then pressing ""open with"" for example waze, waze will open but doesn't calculate any routes. Google maps and tomtom works without problem. Any advice waze team?"
"Clumsy cluttered user interface, and gives same route as Google Maps proper, but with wildly optimistic initial ETA that necessarily gets surreptitiously corrected (to what Google Maps said initially) as the journey progresses."
"it was a great app until the last update. The function to calculate your route for the future disappeared, now I can't see the situation on roads a few hours later, I can't pick a proper time to go. Also the app has a lot of freezes now , it wasn't like that before. Hope you guys will fix it, otherwise I will have to remove it and use Google instead."
"It was a great app But now the ""Is it there?"" Function doesn't time out and close the dialogue without further user input. May go back to Google Maps if this doesn't change back soon."
"Waze is freezing while using Android auto while driving. When you unplug, Waze works as it should. Google maps always works. On a galaxy S9+ Eta: Just wanted to add it is working again"
I'm having the same problem with the speed camera icon staying on screen. It stops other warnings from displaying too I've just discovered. Please fix this bug asap.
I appreciate knowing what's going on in the area that I'm driving. I also like to contribute for other drivers. Super easy to use and it's saved me from more than a few speeding tickets. I'd like to see a feature that shows police moving on the road. Not sure how it'd be done exactly but I'm sure we can figure it out.
"Waze is now bordering on unsafe. It will reroute you while you're approaching or already in an intersection. If you know roughly where you are & where you're going, you'll probably be fine, ignore it & wait for it to recalculate again but if you're somewhere unfamiliar good luck - just don't try to change direction mid-intersection - always proceed in the safest way possible & you'll find there's always a way on to your destination."
"Latest update removed the option to see the best times for arrival to destination from the navigation dialog, and buried this useful option 10 clicks away in the drive planning menu, which is available only for favorites. Moreover, there's now a new and useless routes dialog, blocking the start of a navigation behind a few more extra clicks. UX degradation."
"Used to be my default navigation but now freezes constantly resulting in missing turns, pointless. I have managed to get Waze to work correctly by turning off medium power saving on my phone. It used to work fine with this setting, but now only works with full power mode. Google maps works fine in medium power mode, I don't really want to have to remember to switch settings all the time and my battery on my phone is not the best. Can this be fixed to function how it used to do Waze?"
"New update, now speed cameras only show for a short while then it gets stuck on one and it just says ""speed camera"" or ""average speed check"" in big letters for the rest of the journey and didn't update :("
When an event has been passed on Android Auto the dialog box still displays. There seem to be some serious issues that are on Android Auto. Such as device lag etc
"Used for years normally really good 1. New update keeps crashing. Shows routes, so you pick your route , then you push go , then it goes back to routes Have to close app and start all over again Not ideal when I use it to do 50+ drops a day 2. Doesn't let you report enough problems ... after about 4 times won't let u do any more for the rest of day"
"I'd give it ten. But it has a nasty thing. It overrides the phone's sound settings!!! If I set my phone to silent it's because I need it to be silent. It's *my* phone. This is unacceptable. The developer response that I can turn off notifications in the app misses the point. I need Waze fully on, but if I need the phone silent for a while that means *all of it*. No app should give itself an exception. I should not have to turn apps' sound off individually"
"Twice made me late to my dr appt and it sucks for searching for places. But it will reroute you if there is a road closure etc and I like the different themes. It also will let you know about accidents, speed traps etc."
"Buggy since latest update on Android, android connect to my Ford transit is where I've noticed the bug. One alert for a speed camera and then the alert stays on my screen & don't give a notification for a new camera."
"Has saved my rear end from interstate congestion, and tickets, more times than I can count. Of course, I am from the deep South, so that isn‚Äôt very high. This app is truly worth its weight in gold for me, and I have gotten many friends hooked on it as well."
Waze better then google map because of new road layout. For  some reason why Waze voice navigation has randomly just stop working. And I‚Äôve checked all the settings.google maps is better because work with internet browsers
"Claims my old account doesn't exist, then it doesn't let me create one under my email saying it does exist. Made a whole new account and had to pay fines for toll roads because ""Avoid Toll Roads"" is not on by default. Why would you leave such a valuable feature off by default?"
Latest update causing issues. Things like RR crossing notifications stay up even after you've passed it. Lagging and cuts out. Did not have this experience prior to most recent update.
"Poor options leading to wrong routes. It will not let you override the toll payment issue in some countries, including Austria. So it will not put the fastest option in unless you give the toll vignette number in!"
Great Navigation appm Tells you where construction and police and all sorts of stuff in road ahead. Directions are super easy to follow. Works great with android auto in the car. I like better than Google maps.
Not only does the speedo display on map only intermittently work now the app locks up the moment you plug it into the car. Tried different cables/ clear cache etc. Displays perfectly on the phone but the moment you conne T it to Android Auto it bugs out. Nearly to the uninstall point. Galaxy Note 10+. Now the app loads a black screen on start up and the developers don't reply!
"- When using Waze in a motorbike you turn off the screen to save battery while using Waze with the audio system of your helmet. - How is it possible that Waze is not able to report any new alerts (after the first one) when the screen is off? - This was expected to be fixed since v3.8.1, but still unfixed in 4.87.1.0 - When are you going to fix that feature that is basic when using Waze in a motorbike while not being able to use the screen? - Waze would be awesome but it's ruined by this mistake"
No GPS - approximate location I used to love using Waze and here lately it doesn't show my location on my approximate location. I have closing and uninstalling it and it doesn't work. Anyway it used to be my go to map app and now its not.
Latest update crashes every single time I open it. It's with great trepidation that I ever update Android apps this is why. Several year old version I had been running was reliable
After most recent update alerts don't go away and the next alert doesnt get announced. Massive issue as one huge advantage for Waze was police and speed camera warnings but they are now effectively not working.
"No Waze app for WearOS?! Also, versus Google Maps I prefer when it tells me details of my destination after I arrive. Otherwise great app, has a way better experience overall just too bad no watch support..."
Hi there.. would it be possible to consider an easy ...like top 3 used or most favorite ones menu? Or button? That way it would make it easier to provide timely feedback...
"Waze used to be good but man lately is awful! It freezes then starts, turns itself around and just goes nuts! So frustrating. I find myself just going back to Google maps."
The voice navigation updated recently and it sounds like it had a stroke with slow slurred speach. The old voice was better and sometimes still plays.
The gps keeps failing when tied to Android auto. It is a waze issue as other map apps on Android auto display my location correctly. I've checked the GPS accuracy permissions and that isn't the issue.
Stop asking me to double confirm when I have already confirmed once on the app. You would think that this would work better with Google Auto. It needs to have more options of things to alert to an Android auto. This app is owned by Google!
"Good little app, wish it allowed more types of vehicles. I tow a large caravan and can't get a good estimate of journey time - would like to see a speed restricted option when route planning."
"After starting the app, the screen is locked behind a 'Just a sec...' notification and not working at all. Even after reinstalling and clearing cache the app is still not functioning. I have searched online and the problem is happening on Android phones and people are sick of it. Hope it can be resolved soon as the app is great and should be a five star but for now it's is just bad."
"I am having issue with the toll fare. It's not displaying the toll fare like it used to be in phone and i have no idea why. When i check with other phone, amazingly there is toll fare available for the routes I'm taking. Then why it's not showing under phone?"
"Updated Waze and my issue of ""connecting"" (even though Google Maps is online and working) seems to be OK at the moment. Love Waze. Just wish it was a bit more stable at times"
It's a good app but waits too long to tell you to turn doesn't give you much time you have to go slow when you come near the turn sometimes it tells you halfway into a turning lane to turn and people won't let you in
"1. no choice of fuel type. 2. there is no way to change the address bar. I mean, I begin enter leters of city and chose it from search list, after, this way, I want to add the street, then add the house number. 3. must make the map offline"
"I real wish if the bubble showing current speed had an option to be moved on right side of the screen because it normally gets obstructed by my steering wheel while i keep it on dock, Everytime i need to peek to see my current speed while driving which is quite risky all the time. This is the only app i trust and use regularly for navigation and traffic update. I just wished it could show designated speed of all the roads on a small bubble(Just like Highway Number or Name is shown on the map)."
"I think this app is great overall and I never go anywhere without it guiding me and alerting me, however, in that month the navigation has been off, I'll be on a road and it will keep trying to redirect me to the road I'm actually on, it gets confused and says I'm 2 roads away from the road I'm actually already on. It eventually corrects itself but it interrupts my radio. Hopefully the new update corrects any bugs in the navigation."
"Alerts not going away and makes you miss future alerts. I removed and re-installed and the same problem was going on. It goes away if I go to add a road condotion, hazard or police."
Alerts (camera / red light) getting stuck on screen in the last few days on android auto. You have to swipe the alert to the left to remove it before it will show the next. Happening on my s10plus a friends a52 and another friends s20. Driving us mad as we have to keep touching the screen in our cars.
This WAS my favorite GPS until recently. Please tell me WHY I now have ads popping up while I'm using the app. Hands free??? Not anymore. How am I supposed to focus on the road AND my phone to try and hit the little x while I'm driving? I'm gonna need yall to do better. This is unacceptable.
"The Best! Way better than Google Map. I love the concept of a real map, instead of redrawing the area like what GoogleMap is doing making it hard to use. This one is also easier to use and provides better navigation. It also chooses route with ""no u turn"", ""no left turn"", ""no entry""."
Due to Waze sending me down a road that was a river crossing (ford) (apparently) but there's no way a car can cross it cos it was 2m deep no warning from Waze that is was a ford my car nearly ended up in the river Google maps doesn't have this as a road yet Waze does so cos of this am deleting Waze. Waze or any gps should not take you down roads like this Waze needs lots of improvement for safety
"I like it, the more people that use it the better it gets. I do have 1 problem with it though...if it could distinguish between a police checkpoint and a speed trap would be brilliant. People dont mind going through a speed trap when they know its there...but noone likes going through a checkpoint..."
When it works it's great. Lately the app freezes and lags. Gmaps works fine but I prefer Waze interface. Update After doing the uninstall reinstall route the app was still freezing. I searched online and many had success by disabling location permissions for Android Auto. I did that and waze is working flawlessly so far. Hopefully this could help others. Pixel 6
"I have been using this app since 11 years, it's really good. I think it was a lot fun before Google acquired Waze. Miss those candies which we could collect while driving to new areas."
"Waze stopped working after Android Auto and Waze updates. I reinstalled both programs, Waze and AA, many times but there is no result. As long as I use any other applications that are available to me through the AndroidAuto menu on the car screen, everything works fine. Other navigation programs (Google maps, MapFactor, OsmAnd, HERE WeGo, Yandex navigator, 2GIS, Sygic, TomTom Go) work on the main screen of the car, it is checked!"
Hi waze. I using oled phone and doing ehailing. The problem is I have burn in at my two oled phone at report button and menu at lower phone position.. Pls enable or disable these button as this destroy the phone screen quality. Normally we set maksimum brightness under sunlight . Don't let an image statics for too long as it's cause an oled phone burn in with shadow mark. I used samsung and xioami phone and both have the same outcome within months of usage. Pls reconsider my suggestion. Thanks
App worked fine at first but now it keeps saying not connected to gps even though location is turned on and app has location permission. I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times but still have same issue.
It's good. But I can not use the later function on the saved place and in history when I try to find out the best time departing. I remember it has the later function in previous version. Why your guys remove the later function from the saved place?
Started using this app in Dubai after suggestion of a colleague. This is by far the best app working in UAE perfectly. Its accuracy in lane selection is something which is missing in google maps.
My location is jumping everywhere while running. I switched to google maps and it is more stable. I almost got hit because I immediately pulled over because of rumbling waze pointer.
It is ok. Different than Google but I'll frequently tell me I am not intraffic when I am stuck in stand still for 30 minutes. Good for tracking objects/police and providing more route options than Google. Also: do not use if you do not know your way /proactively read the maps. It always tell you the turns as you are passing them.
"Not working on Android auto. Freezes every 10 seconds, the speedometer goes up and down. Was working good, but not anymore."
"Very good routing and on-point arrival times. Only offline Waze is pretty much useless, but then that's acceptable."
I have never had a GPS app that purposefully and consistently sends you 30 minutes in the wrong direction every single time you turn it on. I will never use this app again.
"It was really nice to plan a drive, now without this functionality I could just use preinstalled google maps. I miss that feature."
"So easy and accurate, the best app to use while driving. Although sometimes my speed counter disappears on the display using Android auto connection"
"Alerts keep freezing on screen blocking map & directions. Frozen alerts also prevent upcoming alerts. Unfortunately, it's unusable."
"Doesn't bring you at the right location. Many addresses at just wrong, and you end up at a place that is no where near the actual location."
I am having issues with Waze not correctly showing my location on my Jeep U-Connect. It will lock showing me in a location when I'm still driving. Jeep says it's an issue with Waze. Waze works fine on my phone
App is good but clunky and memory intensive. Also has bugs where voice alerts for police/speed camera do not always prompt.
It quits giving me instructions after about 30 seconds. Gives me alerts when I'm not plotting a route but that's the only time it talks to me.
Lol signing up was just circular hell where they send an email which contains link when clicked just brings up a screen that says no account found and sends you to a verification loop.
1 star for notice. I like to keep the fixed north and 2D and when I connect to AndroidAuto it doesn't zoom when I am about to turn as much as when you have a 3D view and unfixed north.
"Waze is good but lately hasn't been effective as it takes me through tolls when I enable AVOID TOLL. This is not good. Kindly fix, it's costing unnecessary expenses."
Tried using the app to get to Levi Stadium parking lot green 1. It took us to the wrong parking lot and cost us 45 minutes trying to get to the right place.
12/26/2022: The weird audio bug with the female voice persists. It's much deeper; it sounds like it's slowed down. Phone: Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G
"Love it. Wish there was a way to mark Law enforcement that is moving. For instance driving ahead of you, or opposite direction, etc."
Since the update 22Dec2022 fixing the disappearing warnings the program freezes on and off on Android Auto. It makes navigating in domestic areas a hit and miss.
Hi waze Can u please put a little logo next to speed of the actual speed so people can see the actual road speed and then can drive Because some time its confusing the road speed like the Google maps does Its show you the road speed And the show you your's speed Witch is helpful And u can drive according to the road speed Thanks üòä
"Worked great till a recent update that means that notifications in android auto get stuck, which means the USP of the app is gone until resolved. Updated score to reflect recent fix."
The app is easy too navigate and understand plus has many great optimization options for many things like your car or routes and navigation or speed limits.
"worst...lots of ads...traffic update is not real time, although there is jam in 10km distance but waze wont tell you or reroute at all...its ETA is total lie...system just sits there do nothing and let you face the jam!"
"I love waze but i wish it would audibly alert you to speed cameras even if your under the speed limit,it visually shows you but i can't see it every time as im driving please sort this out waze or im gonna go back to google mapsüò•üò•üò•"
Other app are less intrusive with the amount of personal data and audio they want to collect and sell on. Three times more than competitors.
It's ok except being able to edit roads and alerts that you place like construction sites and police hardly stays on the map for long enough
"Works good mostly, there was an issue where the map believed everytime I slowed down I had driven down a side street or driven backwards. But it could have been because of cloud cover"
"App has worked great with Android Auto up until the last update, now when a disabled vehicle or railroad crossing comes up it does not clear the notification once you are past it, very annoying"
I drive 6 days a week all day long and really need a good map app. Its actually imperative. with Waze I start a trip and several times I have to start trip again coz it just stops and shuts down.
"Navigating through this app is a nightmare! I tried to use it as an alternative to Google maps, but quickly regretted downloading it. I'm uninstalling right after this post"
"This app is fantastic. I used to use another, more well known gmaps...that led me on some interesting trecks. I was going to a funeral in Maryland and it led me on such a convoluted trip that I missed the funeral, and so I put in the cemetery. It led to the cemetery with a locked gate...it said Pet Cemetery!"
Most of the time it worked flawlessly except in few occasions it lagged a bit.Please add the offline navigation functionality and I am sure it will be the best navigation app .
"Don't believe the hype. Takes a truckload of space just to run in basic form plus no external storage support or offline caching for maps (even Google Maps does that). Frequently useless unless you have a supremely powered phone, constant fast network and lots of data allowance. Definitely another one to steer clear of."
"Great app, so far so good. But recently I tried to report a road closure, I couldn't stop at the actual closure but was able to pull over at a side street. When I added the closure to the map it put the closure at the side street I was on even though I had highlighted the road on the map before adding the report. Could not see a way to add incident to a road that I'm not on."
"Some times it drop off grid ,needed to be updated with the the secondary street and lane ,not only major roads ,needed to be updated with new building names as well ."
"Junk. Can't even give a home address. There is no enter key, just a search option. That only results in a partial address. Waste of time."
It's very good on nearly everything I want from it. The scoreboard worked for just one day in the last few weeks. Now I again get an Oops message. Seems that others have this problem as well. Any chance of getting this fixed?BTW I don't have Facebook. BVT Since the latest update the Oops message is back and the scoreboard doesn't work. Today my score is being calculated and I am asked to try later. Perhaps it will resolve itself. Meanwhile it navigates well enough. Date 13th October 2022
"Well, I would love to try and like Waze cause the concept looks great and most of the reviews are stellar.. but I cannot even use the app cause it crashes every time I want to start a route. My phone OS (Oxygen) is updated and I have already tried deleting and reinstalling Waze, but the problem persists. So until that is fixed and I can actually use it, I cannot give any rating above 1 star EDIT: Love generic responses. I literally said in my review that I already did these things. So helpful.."
Was brilliant 5 stars. But not anymore as since last weeks samsung s22+ update and a updated waze. The mobile camera detector label once displayed don't disappear so you never know where next camera is. And the pulse also stops
"Installed and Unistalled since the app is born, can't figure it out. it's like a Christmas tree , lights and colors, traffic is shown so far as the next province(doesn't help me reaching ""home"") Alternative route no, purple which is covering red traffic flash light doesn't help, can't see how bad is the traffic. Plus hundreds of others drivers(figure out how to remove the distraction). Make it simple , Alternative routes even if it's longer or have to pay for it. anyway a lot of users are happy"
Waze is having a personality crisis! First one voice begins speaking then a different voice finishes. Driving me crazy. Just one voice is needed.
"Tried to use it. Logged in. Frozen screen. Uninstalled. Reinstalled. Same problem. Unusable. Edit: upgraded to 5 stars. Came back and re-opened a day later, loaded perfectly! Slick interface, works great. Don't know if there was a new update? Phone wasn't rebooted. Phone us Oppo Find X2 Pro CPH2025, Android V12. Developer very responsive."
"This app was once great at reducing commute times. Lately, the app has only done the complete opposite. Uninstalling to find something better."
"Hi. The Waze app won't open on my phone, a Samsung J4, even after removing and reinstalling the app."
"Looks like a great app apart from one major issue. Adverts pop up in the middle of a journey and cover the map, which forces you to close it on the screen which is very dangerous when driving. I will not be using this app until this stupid feature is removed."
This thing is absolute trash. they don't show you the word for word directions like a normal App would. it doesn't even give me the option to figure out how to see the word for word directions. What is the actual point if you can't see where you're going and read it?
Please be aware that touching a screen or touching a phone at all while driving in Australia is an offence and attracts a large fine and demerit point. Having to acknowledge notifications and swipe away warnings is a big problem.
One the best apps in uae It lets you the best route traffic jams and the speed cameras and let's you save so much of money for a new driver in uae . If it gives the offline maps or download options it would be even better but 10* for this app
"Hi I really like the app because it describe perfectly how to arrive every place...But something began to fail. I don't know if this is a bug or else, the thing is: I can't report anything while i'm on the road. Also I can't open music. Instead I have to close WAZE and open SPOTIFY myself. I even uninstall it and install again, and nothing worked. Is there anything on settings I need to change?"
"What happened to waze? It used to be good, but now the route planning is simply catastrophic. Even for straightforward trips it suggests huge detours (I'm talking about a 100 km detour on a trip that would be approx 700 otherwise and the detour made no sense whatsoever. ) This was not an exception. In general, when comparing suggested routes from different navi sys, unfortunately, waze very often has non-optimal routes"
"Doesn't download route, not that I can find anyway, so when you stop somewhere with no signal whilst connected to Android Auto, it doesn't save your route so your effectively lost!"
"I recently downloaded this app and so far I'm amazed. Tons of features and it's fun to use , Easy too. You can also use music apps om the go , multiple routes , traffic updates and police ! 5/5 stars!"
"Great app but it seams that last update changed voice navigation. Now Im getting notification in every intersection, that means that voice navigation is talking almost all the time."
"Utterly useless. No traffic info, no detailed maps. Tried clearing cache, reinstalling the app but didn't result in any improvement."
I like this app but I am unable to hear the instructions on my phone unless the car windows are closed and the radio is off. I have to switch over to google maps for a reasonable volume. My hearing is rated as very good and usually have my phone volume no more than 75% but even at 100% I cannot hear the Waz instructions.
Latest update broke the app on Android Auto. It doesn't follow as you are driving around as if it freezes then 2 mins later it jumps to the location I'm at. Unsuable! I had to switch to Google Maps (same company I know..) It worked perfectly prior to the last update. This is on a Pixel 6 and Ford Focus vehicle
Not working on Pixel 6A on Android Auto. I always used Waze but it just doesn't seem to work on my new phone.
"Since the latest update, the app sucks! My daily route crosses state lines & I use to determine traffic flow, accidents, etc. Before the update, the route was continuous from point A to point B. Now the directions are from point A to the state line & then from the state line to point B. This is a totally useless feature. No interstate routes need to break at a state line. Please fix!"
"It works well a lot of the time, but it will bug out and try to take you on completely unnecessary detours. This morning on the way to work, it wanted me to get off on EVERY freeway exit, and then immediately get back on the freeway. It even tried to have me get off the freeway, turn left, go down a few lights and then make a u-turn and get back on the freeway where it told me to exit... It time for an update or I'll have to go to another app."
Just started using this app for a couple of weeks and have noticed the speedometer on app is higher by about 3 or so kilometres. How do you adjust speed. I don't want to get fined. Otherwise I'm loving using this app.
I love this app but not now. There was sudden update which I hate it. I am getting notifications about camare far away from where it is. 500m I dont remember if there is camara or not. Plus now it telling me I passed the camara Junction even thought I can't even went close to it yet. Please change it
"After the latest update, I experienced buffering in loading map directions. Very slow. I will rate it 1 star because of that. Hope you fix this issues."
"Ex: Navigate to locale Walmart - suggests I park in the parking lot to the AIRPORT next door. That zero stars right there. Also app crashed twice in my 1 hour having it. Using up to date ultra device too, so not my phone.. MiUI 13 global Android 12 Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra Only using bec GMaps is down, would continue to use if it gets better who knows"
"I absolutely love this GPS app!!! It allows users to report police, traffic, road hazards, accidents, construction, and more, along with their exact coordinates! I find it extremely necessary to know where the cops are, since I like to drive kinda fast. I used to use radar detecting equipment, but I found that this app actually worked better at detecting the police than that! It even specifies whether the cops are hidden or not, so you know what to look out for."
"Good app, latest update requires a response to a road hazard, unless I acknowledge the referenced hazard, it remains on the screen. Sometimes traffic/semi trucks/etc won't allow me to observe the existence or non-existence of a road hazard"
"Useless. I started on a route which I knew that for the last days was really busy, but Waze kept saying it's not that busy as usual. The ETA raised with more than 2 hours in less than 30km, which was already too late for me to go to the faster route (which was not even an option on Waze). This happened two days in a row. The second day I turn around and took the other route which was much faster, including the km I had to do for reroute. Never had this useless experience before."
"Missing critical function.. I use a touchpad in car by bluetooth in on andriod unit, I should be able to click the report function with the pointer. It does not work. Also why can't I move the report button to the left? Reaching over like that for me is an effort and distracting. Otherwise 4 to 5 stars on review, one star is get attention of devs.."
"Doesn't work on Andriod Auto, it freezes mid-drive all the time which makes it useless for me. It's a navigation app that doesn't navigate."
"hello! latest version and the online + in-app instructions to turn on voice commands are no longer correct.. in my app the option is not there. Would need to be able to ""report traffic"" via voice to avoid touching screen while driving. Also, is there a setting so navigation commences immediately to the first search result of an address, without requiring us to touch the screen to confirm and commence navigation? This info is not on your own website. Please provide current instructions?"
"Great on Android Auto. It is way better than my native navigation in my car. I always use Waze via Android Auto on my car Navi screen. There are 2 small things that keep it from being 5 stars, maybe these could be in a future update: 1. Have the option to show elevation on the map, most navigation devices do. 2. Allow the passenger to search for an address while driving. Can do on phone screen but on Android Auto, I have to stop & park, even if the passenger on the right seat is keying it in."
"Amazing. Plenty of warnings when to turn, potholes, etc. Can definitely blindly follow directions given to you by the app, has never been wrong yet!"
Weird voice bug has two different voices speaking and it's really annoying. Please fix this it's driving me insane
Why can it no longer calculate a drive going into the next day?? It just popped the same message up and locks up the app now....
"I used to really love it, and it worked flawlessly, but now it freezes on Android auto. It starts but the map never moves. .... Follow up.... I went to settings/apps/Waze/storage and then cleared data. After closing that, I restarted the app and logged in, and everything was as good as new. ü§ó"
"The apps stop working when I use Android Auto on my car screen, every time when the phone screen time out is activated on the phone (30 seconds) ... it just freeze ... so it useless for car travelling !!! By the way Google Maps works perfectly ... maybe its the way Google try to kill Waze and direct all user to use Google Maps !"
"Sure its not perfect, but near. I use mainly for the police markers. I contribute as much as i can when its safe to do so. Or ill make my passengers do it. It has saved me numerous tickets. **posts about moving between apps and waze exits? i have a dedicated cell phone just4 Waze. I also, always want to see the map, for ""spots"" to avoid. So i cant say ive noticed that problem. I know ive seen waze running in notifications when im not directly viewing ?"
"I was introduced to this app few years ago by my husband. Before that I relied on my tom Tom satnav. Since using Waze I never looked back. Never used no other maps. I'm a domiciliary carer, everyday I travel to New places. Waze has always been my no.1 HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
"What happened with waze? Recently it gives from 3 to 5 minutes difference on ETA compared to Google map . Google map gives the shortest ETA time arrival recently, it used to be the opposite."
"One thing Google maps has over this app, is how Google maps will tell you if the shop you're navigating to is closed or open. Most annoying when you navigate to a place and find out it's closed. I wish there'd be a way for Waze to get third party data to see if the shop is open during the time and day your navigating to the destination."
"I installed the latest update (Ver 4.9), but the voice is still changing. Also, the volume of the voice seems to increase on its own, too."
"I'm not sure what is going on now, but on Android Auto, this locks up constantly. Everything else works fine, but Waze freezes almost immediately... It'll catch up to your actual position in like ten minutes, but then it'll just freeze again. Very recent problem on a Pixel 6 Pro. Nothing I've found online seems to resolve the problem so guidance from support or an update to address the problem is much appreciated."
"Two things that have recently happened: 1. App would not work or update the drive whilst in the background and eventually shut down (go into sleep mode). 2. More recently - one day the app stopped working all together. It would get stuck in a spinning icon saying ""one sec"". I deleted cache, deleted data and re-download the app and still nothing. Android - Samsung Galaxy A32 5g"
"This app has been glitchy for months! I hope this update fixes it. Tell me why when I enter in an address Waze routes me through residential subdivisions instead of staying on the main roads?! It makes no sense. Sometimes it takes me through a subdivision in a circle & deposits me back on the same road I started on! None of this makes any sense. Get your act together, Waze!"
"I've just spent over ¬£3,000 having Carplay installed into my car only to find that Waze will freeze after just a few minutes. Also, the speed has disappeared, not so much of a problem in the UK, but in France it's a big problem as many roads don't have speed limit signs. Google maps works, but that too has lost the speed info'. How come the developers don't go out for a drive and see for themselves? I'm using a Galaxy S21."
So dumb. A navigation app that doesn't let you plan a route from point a to point b is pointless. I guess it's only useful to get you home from the bar.
"Everything is great. But please please add double tap zoom. I feel it's a must. A lot of times i just closed waze and opened gmaps, because of this."
"UPDATE: Useless, I recommend to install 2020 version 4.66 from Uptodown, confirmed working... After updates this year it keeps refreshing after changing route, crashes, restarts, therefore cannot navigate, best app turned into buggy trash, will have to find another one or just to use Google maps instead.. Useless, and I'm not recommending to trust it anymore, esp in city traffic. If u travel somewhere you don't know, do not rely on it, it will crash in worst moments."
"Very disappointing. I only downloaded this app for Morgan Freeman's voice option. Like who cares about Amy and Randy... Do not waist your time with this app. Promotions are pointless, if you remove the voice afterwards."
"No idea why, but Waze rebooted my phone 4 times within an hour yesterday on a 5 hour journey. When I decided to try Google maps instead of Waze, my phone didn't reboot once. Definitely an issue I could do without on such a long journey. But at least you got your adverts working! Revenue over user experience, the Alphabet way!"
"Generally excellent app, except for ONE thing, the speed limit and speedometer icons are too small, these need to be seen at a glance, and to be clear! Look at HERE WeGo navigation, which is not quite as good, but the speed limit and speedometer icons are larger and clearer - change these and I will immediately switch back to Waze as default."
Used to be the best navigation out there but over the last few months it has really been horrible went to my cellphone provider thinking maybe it was my brand new phone however it definitely was not nor was it connection issues. I click on app and it just sits there won't let me type in or anything app keeps freezing up constantly and I have the most up to date update and still does it. I have been using Google maps instead.
"After the last update, alerts that come up on the screen do not go away unless manually dismissed. Also, the mileage to an obstruction, disabled vehicle or police ahead is missing."
Since last week the app has been constantly eating up lots of memory and RAM. Causing the app and even my phone to goes unresponsive. It was great until last week. I hope whatever bug is causing this issue to be fixed else it is very inconvenient especially during heavy traffic and in need to search for new route.
"Sent me through the London congestion charge even though I had the ""no tolls"" option selected in settings. Also sends you the longest route to save time, even if it only saves a couple of minutes (for example 27miles on the motorway 56mims, the alternative being 11 miles on local roads 59mins) the amount of extra carbon emissions caused by this (and the extra petrol cost) will be significant. You need to introduce an eco mode/option asap, your app must be causing a lot environmental damage."
It's a very good app to reach any location. And it's very easy to knows about road lane and line.its guide properly. I love this app.its slove my problem to reach in location on time.i recommended to everybody to download this app and use.once you download then you will see which k8nd of this app.
This version of the app keeps locking up. The map feature works but no input from screen works. It always starts when the stupid ads pop up. I have to terminate and restart the app. It happens every time I use it for more than about 10 minutes
"I use this and don't ever need Google maps, e.g. seamlessly connects to my car display (Kia 2021) and anything else I've needed so far."
"I use to love this app Un until Last week and its still going on today, I get my first initial alert and the icon just stays on the screen and I get no more alerts. I've Uninstalled the app several times and the same thing keeps happening. My alerts just don't work after my first initial alert."
"I've used Waze for many months with no issue. Suddenly it refuses to launch and has signed me out and lost my account, with no way to recover it because there was no email address assigned to it even though there was my Google play account, phone number, and Facebook connected to it. I've now lost all my saved locations. Time to start again. My review would be 5 stars if not for how unstable the app is. (Galaxy S8)"
I am currently working on a quote from Waze to move a storage unit merchandise two States away. They have been very nice and I look forward to working with them.
"This would be 3.5 stars if I could. I used to LOVE this app. One of my favorite features was that I could plan a future drive, so if know what time I needed to leave for an appointment based on the usual traffic flow. But you've taken that feature away! I used the feature all the time to travel to different doctor appointments. I do like that I can now tell the app that I'm using the carpool lanes. Please bring back the plan a drive feature!"
"If you're having trouble with the app not working on android auto restart your device and it usually fixes the problem. Wish it would download onto my pH but I can't get it back, it also gives weird directions to my house telling me to go down a dirt track instead of turning into my actual street and it's hard to report issues, it's not as accurate as maps but it at least warns U about cops and speed traps which is the big plus for me"
"This app suddenly stopped working. When I start my car it tells me to disconnect and sign in, but I'm already signed in. I love using the app for driving back and forth to work. It notifies me of hazards on the road etc. However, may have to uninstall if the problem is not resolved."
"Brilliant App. Introduced to it by my father in law and haven't stopped using it. A couple of suggested improvements 1) allow users to download map, so, when in bad network areas waze can still plan the route. Sometimes I need to set of for a distance before I get signal then have to pull in and set up waze to work. 2) with newer diesel cars there is a requirement to use adblue (DEF) would it be worth adding to the recording of fuel prices, the price of adblue? For me it would be helpful"
"Was working great with Android Auto until the May 22 update. Since then, either bounces back to main AA screen or locks up AA completely and the only way to recover is force stop Waze on the phone. I see that many people have the same issue. I did try uninstalling/reinstalling waze and AA...oddly enough, even installing an older version that used to work fine now has the same issue. 2021 cx5 with Samsung Galaxy S7. Update - worked for a while after an update, but stopped on next update."
"It was the best app, but lately...it is worst...I used it for years, being a minicab in London for 5 years and in the last 2 years, I was a long run courier driver, ...now it doesn't even give me the best route, I always have to recalculate routes, check, and it's ussually... always the 2nd one, and along the road, it crashes and comes back to the longest one in time and in length. Continuously crashes, and sometimes it takes me out of the motorway, sending me to country roads, then back"
App is freezing mid trip and is being super spotty after last update. I have used this app for years with zero issues until now making it completely unusable. It will freeze them come back and do that over and over again. It's not my connection because I have been in the same are for my entire life with zero issues.
"App is great but I've noticed an annoying thing in the ""plan a drive"" option. It allows you to pre-plan a drive etc. but using this option does not show you all the multiple route options you have. Instead it pre-selects the quickest route. Yes this is useful BUT some of us may want to avoid certain routes e.g. ULEZ routes but it auto-select ulez routes (i.e. the shortest routes) if you use ""plan a drive"" option. Devs please provide a way to select alternative routes when pre-planning route."
"Android Auto won't show route and follow. I know I've got the right USB as Google maps navigation works perfect, but I like the interface and features on Waze better. When I disconnect the cable, Waze works fine. Something is definitely wrong with the app."
"Waze app will not ""shutdown"" after I have when viewed a shared drive. It goes through the process like it's going to shutdown but it then reopens to the shared drive. I have to kill the app to come out of it. There are no issues when I use the app this only happens when I view a shared drive."
"The ads are a little annoying but easily ignored. The time it kept me out of traffic, and the speed traps far outweigh the annoyance. Apps like this only get better with user input. I you like and want to help fix it, join the map editing community."
"The new device limit makes this app unusable. In the middle of driving the whole screen is covered by a message that I started using the app on another device and asking what I want to do. Why? Why limit to one device at a time? It makes no sense. I want to run it on my phone and my car radio, for whatever reason, it doesn't even matter. It shouldn't be an issue for Waze. The only reason to do that is some data mining Google is doing. There's no other reason."
"Chances of getting lost with this app is like one in a thousand, I have been using it for the better part of this year and I have always been impressed by its quality of direction, it gives you the direction way before you get to your turns ,living in the city you need to know in advance what is the next turn. Some GPS devices let's you know right at turns or when you missed the turns."
"Believe it or not, a cheap POS cable will charge your phone but not allow your phone to connect WAZE to your Ford Sync3 console. I learned the hard way after trying for days. Switched to a better cable and I'm back in the game with all the necessary applications updated!"
"Recently GPS in Waze became terrible. It loses the signal very often, while signal is strong and other apps working with GPS do so without any problem. It suddenly loses signal on an empty road and you have to wait for a couple of moments. What can be the issue? Well, I am utilizing the 2016 made Honor 6x phone but never experienced GPS lagging with other progs, but Waze doing this terrible in recent times."
"Speedometer stopped working. The speedometer is a primary reason for using waze, along with all the alerts you can get. Without the primary function for me, this app is rated at a 1. I have tried everything to fix it with zero results"
I have use the Waze App for years and it has save me a lot of money and Headache. We all got to look out for each other and this is another great way !!! Another thing is the navigation changes routes when there is heavy traffic which is Terrific.
"It operates like Google maps now, which is not a good thing. I put in an address for an office/business inside of a big lot and it will just take me to the street of the location will not direct left/right or where inside the lot the actual business/office is. Certain places I knew already where to go but for a place I've never been to I had to search through the lot and figure out where to go from there on my own. I use to love using this app but now I might as well use Google. Plz fix asap"
It used to be a really good app but it no longer works with Android Auto. It constantly freezes and when you look online it seems to be an issue for many users. It's a shame as I feel it is superior to Google Maps in many ways.
"When I open the app, the gps won't work for some reason even though I've tried to restart the phone .. Uninstall and Install the App still it won't work... It won't show the direction it would go to when you are driving and using the App.. it's keep on lagging..."
"I love Waze and will continue to use it. Some issues I've ran into are if I close the app, it will close the directions all together. And the zoom out function isn't very large. Love how you can personalise your profile though."
"I use this app for everyday use. Suddenly it stopped working saying ""No network connection, Try again later."" I tried clearing app cache, uninstalling and installing app, restarting the phone. However it still shuts down immediately showing no network connection. Every other apps are working and there is no network problem whatsoever."
"Is ok for long distance travel, but tends to go offline a lot in Manchester UK local areas; it also diverts you to very busy junctions and dead ends, so you waste time. I then switch back to Google maps, so unfortunately I had to uninstall Waze."
"Time to destination is extremely optimistic! I've been a Waze user for years and it seems like the time to destination calculations are all screwed up lately. Examples: 10/12/22 driving from Detroit MI to Orangeburg SC, I would have had to average over 100mph to make the estimated time. Just now, from Daytona FL to Robbinsville NC, I would have to average over 81mph for 7.5 hours. I get the same result if Personalized ETA on or off. (I don't travel anywhere near that speed anyway!)"
"Maybe it's because I live in a small town, but I uninstalled this app as I didn't see much use in it. Google maps worked better. Police patrols weren't very accurate nor noticeable in my area. I saw more waze users on the highways than anything."
"Always suggests a 3km longer route to save no time for no reason. Keep changing route mid-drive. Always flash a banner ""This route has the same ETA with..."" upon starting drive. Cannot prioritise shorter route over faster route Really need to work on those bad UX"
"Overall good but when Android split screen is used, navigation marker and map is not refreshed unless the window has focus. But to my surprise, odometer is updated. Don't know why this is happening."
"Best Navigation app out there!! It's very accurate, u can save places, destinations and all its users participate in updating routes as far as where cops are sitting, roadkill, construction, hazards, ect. Easier to use vs Google maps!"
For some reason the navigation gets confused and thinks I am driving a different compass direction when I am not. Almost as if it is having spasms. Even when driving straight. New phone and new app install.
Great if you want an app that takes up space and does nothing. Can't even get a route to anything. Sweet.
I use to like waze but here lately when I lose service instead of keeping my rout up it glitches out. Just recently I got lost due to this and had to drive about an hour and a half more to get to my destination. I ended up stopping and having a panic attack because of this issue and had some older lady not helped me figure out where I was I wouldn't have gotten where I was heading. I would have instead ended up in another state altogether.
"I like how the app provides updates from other users on real-time road conditions -- this is the best feature for waze. However, it would be better if you can integrate the ""add multiple stops"" section like the way Google maps does it to help plan long road trips."
"July 24 update made the app unusable. It locks up. No tracking info, won't even respond to touch input. It worked once after I uninstalled/reinstalled the app. It immediately locked up the next time I tried to use it. This issue happens most often when using Android Auto."
Rothertite tunnel in London is only for small cars rated max to 2 tons. I want to avoid that route ad my vehicle is a bit heavier than 2t ables there is no option to avoid that route.If you select choose different routes all those variations coming through Rothertite tunnel. Its so annoying that I am ready to change to different app.how to stop this from happening again..
"This app is discussing. I had 600km drive, even though I choose route in advance knowing that I wont have internet driving, Waze would change route without letting me know, twice ended up by a border with another country (that I didn't plan to cross). Had to make long detour to return. After that Waze gave up forcing me to cross the boarder it would navigate me to centers of all big cities on my way to get me in traffic jams. It made me waste extra 2h driving. Never happen google maps."
"Having the same experience as Mr bungle. I used Waze everyday for over 18 months and it works great... When it works It stopped working while using it and after I start it it says ""just a sec"" and either continues this for ever it just freezes. Emailed support and was told to submit the issue within the app... And obviously can't do that if the app doesn't work. After trying uninstalling/reinstalling, clearing cache and memory.. restarting phone absolutely no luck.. Just flat out can't use it"
"Noticed I'm not the only one having trouble with stopping and starting while useing waze on Android Auto, it just hangs then 3 or 4 minutes later it jumps to where you are for a minute then hangs again, totally useless if driving in built up area. Google maps works flawlessly so the problem is not my car or Android Auto app."
Noticed this morning that Waze no longer works when stored on an SD card. Had to move to internal memory.
Love the app especially when traveling. I wish there was an option to select when we're towing the trailer. Also want an option to stop navigation through neighborhoods.
"Not user friendly at all, better to use Google maps. Only use this app for the notifications along my route. Unable to easily enter destinations A and B for an overview, unlike Google maps. Crashes frequently and will not set up a route if you have poor service. Only reason to use this app is for live traffic updates."
"Could I suggest adding selectable options, say 100m, 500m, 1km, etc, to traffic jam/accident/etc avoidance? I seem to be routed to a jammed route, only to be in the thick of things, and be announced that there's an accident, jam, congestion ahead on the road. Or an algorithm tweak to cater for this?"
"There is not much difference if compared to Google Maps. Google maps shows traffic in various colours whereas there is no colour differentiation of the traffic along the route. Secondly, if the ride is changed by a rider the app should change the route accordingly which is not the case with Waze. Moreover, it also does not know about any road closure. Don't think I would switch over because it's not helpful as claimed by them."
"When I click my waze at the bottom, this app keep opening and closing again ang again... It has to be fixed I guess."
Worked great at first. What the hell it now freezes and very frustrating. Fix it or lose it. Should I startooking at other options.
"No option to report hazard off location. You only can report hazards while driving or stoping at the exact location, it means braking law by stopping where you can't or using phone while driving...."
Excellent navigation tool. Keep you informed with traffic situations and weather conditions. I use it everyday.
Meh not impressed. All voices are grayed out for navigation. Have Uninstaller reinstalled checked all settings still all voices are grayed out so you get no voice assistance
"Quite good now but still requires too many interactions with the touchscreen, especially when setting a destination on the go."
"Doesn't support Coolwalk. When using android auto, the app doesn't support the new Coolwalk interface. I got dev response saying something like request something, we do our best. You are google! Just support your own stuff."
"The ads are ridiculous. Where is the Pro/paid version? I use enough data for navigation, I don't need to be spending on advertising."
"Big waste of time. Google owns this right? So how come Google knows my destination is permanently closed, yet Waze doesn't? Awful for the environment, since i drove 50mi out of my way. I imagine this happens to others as well."
The woman's voice keep switching between normal tone & lower tone out of sudden ! What's worse is both are guiding me to different directions when they co-exist. Is my app haunted or what?
"Waze on Android auto has recently a lot of bugs, for instance speed cam notification doesn't go away or any kind of notification it stays there until you take it away"
"Latest update is... odd. Speeds all over the place, map spinning, and multiple voices for the same direction."
"Very nice app for navigation, great graphics, clear map and fun with all voices, more different voices should come as well."
"Love this app and use it every day but recently i have thos problem of the gps not moving with me but does with other apps, i can get it to move if i toggle gps on and off but it just refreshes to my latest location and stays there. I hope a dev see's this."
This app never alerts for speed cameras. Even when the route is directed thru. But somehow it always alerts for red light cameras. Backward functionality . Please fix it
This was great but now it keeps giving me different directions to take back to back . Sometimes it's running and will not even show the directions on the screen.
"It's a good app one small suggestion, when we approaching speed cameras a tone to warn drivers as too often you have to keeps eye on the road. Just you get other voice notifications ,"
I find the app to become less and less appealing. I nolonger see my friends and it has become more and more difficult to navigate.
One instance at a time is a really bad idea for people with multiple devices. This will force us to sign up unnrcessary multiple accounts.
It needs an urgent update ! The radar alerts are always stuck ! It will never show the new radar until you swipe it manually by your finger. Please update the app ASAP !!
"it often looses the address i put in and i need to search again. Today i tried to put ridgecrest california, couldn't find a road lol. Annoying. It's a pitty I like some of waze features"
"Recent updates cause my warning message stay on screen after the event and prevent new notifications. I must swipe left to erase the old warning , before it will cancel by it self."
"Stopped advising road / police warnings verbally. The ""speed camera"" ""there, not there"" stays on the screen. Your last update caused this. Please fix it asap. Android"
5 stars. Let you know exactly where the speed traps/cameras are. That itself makes this app priceless. You can help others by reporting what you come across as you go.
Navigation gets stuck in infinite loops or changing route every few seconds. No longer usable.
I have used waze for 3-5 years and all was good. However within the last week it says there is no gps. I can use Google maps and be ok but waze won't connect to the gps
It's good bit it doesn't show you speed limits correctly. Also it took me two times to a no entry area....üòë
"Enjoying the football version ,I laugh and drive alone with good company of waze. Add another feature on yet watch your pedal too fast or too slow similar to red light ahead promots"
Red light banner warning does not disappear from the screen when it is passed. Same for speed trap banner. Please fix for better rating.
Sometimes it's difficult to save places to my list of saved places because the ‚ù§Ô∏è that you need to highlight is on some of the places and Sometimes it's not.
Terrible app. Gone down hill massively. Doesn't know about road closures until it's too late and you're on top of them.
"Earlier voice was good, now the voice that speaks is very hard, and doesn't talk about speed camera.... waze is not updated, it is backdated.."
Very good app. It works well for me . I like it also because if your out in the middle of no where as long as you have your destination programmed it will not get dropped or lose service. I give it 5 stars
"Cannot Log-in anymore. Recently changed phone and now, I lost all my progress, badges and saved things. It just wont connect to anything. No data no Wifi. Contantly stays at ""No connection"" when trying to log in to my account. Very disappointed since i used this more than anything. Now im forced to go back to google maps."
Did not know one way streets in Brisbane city. It was directing us to go into one way streets the wrong way. The system needs to be updated.
"Used to be great, now mostly annoying and increasingly irrelevant since the new Android Auto Coolwalk layout (which Waze doesn't support)"
"Its a good app. But there is a bug where it keeps saying ""just a sec"" but after 5 hours its still saying that, But there is a chance that is just stops , the screen went black and i can't tap anything and i already tried restaring, clearing the ache , clearing the data , redownload the app but i can't get it to work. Please fix this problem."
Would love to use this app. However I can't create an account. Put in your email and then it asks for a code from the verification email. That email contains only a link to verify your email address. Click that and the app says there is no account with that email and dumps you back at the start of the create account process. Frustrating.
"Poor directions. How does Google maps get it right, but Waze can't? Giving directions using closed roads, wrong speed limits, directions using large amount of stop signs, just poor overall directions. The only good feature is police notification."
"App was working great but now gets stuck on the first speed camera it passes and doesn't clear automatically, then doesn't pick up anymore afterwards."
I love this app but for the past week it hasn't been working. Keeps saying there was an error calculating the route even though there's service on my phone. I've reset my phone but have still had the same issue.
"Having major issues on my zfold with Android Auto. App keeps freezing up and won't move. When it works, it works great"
"This has to be the best navigation app out there, it will re-route you through all kinds of traffic issues. Thank you for everything that you have done. Thoroughly Epic App."
It is very hard to select from a huge list of vignette the one you need so if you don't add the vignette will chose you a longer route on national roads.
The app stop working. I have uninstall 5 times and reinstall does not show I have a GPS location. But it works fine on my other phone. I love the app
"this app went completely crazy. im hearing two voices, and it wont stop saying "" Turn right on... "" like it thinks im still home. unusable as of now."
"Love the app but recently same issue as A Hurley and Kenny Goude, when first speed camera comes up it gets stuck on and won't go off screen and show newer ones, maybe a bug with new update!"
Really wants to get replaced. Showing ads when you come to a halt. Restarting in loop when it's not in the mood to work.
"I know you know there are bugs. I'm just letting you know as of now, the bugs are still there. But in case you need to know. My vehicle on the app goes from one part of the city to the next. If I were actually using it for directions, I would be driving off a cliff."
Navigation is good but somehow I have second thought after because it keep on asking you to navigate without any reason so I hope something can be done to solve this.
Update: GPS location is slow show always connecting to gps everytime I open the app. When I open different navigation app it's 1 click to locate your position.
"In my opinion, this app is the best android navigation app. Smart user interface, excellent navigation and suggestions of good routes away from traffic are the features of this software."
"The app works fine except when I pass by a speedcam or redlightcam the icon remains on continuously even after I passed already (this is happening after the last update, before it was ok)."
"Keeps the notification for speed and other items on the menu and doesn't refresh for the next one. Uninstall, reinstall, issue persists."
"My go to navigation app, but recently whenever a speed cam or stop light cam warning comes up it doesn't clear on its own after passing the camera and prevents any other alerts from showing up unless I manually clear it."
"This would be a great app since it gives you 3 different street routes, however for me to pick the best one it would be nice if it had written out directions as well like Google."
I've taken two stars off because the android auto app still doesn't have the ability to add locations whilst driving via audio like Google maps does
"I was at the airport and got turned around trying to find the parking garage, I opened waze, and it got me right to where I needed to go which i thought was really cool. 5 stars. Well earned"
"Don't like the new voice, it's too deep the intelligibility is poor with some background noise, can't distinctly tell what some words are with road noise, music or others talking in the background"
"With the new update, The Red light camera warning only show once and it just stays on screen n doesnt go off and doesnt even give any other warnings after that. Please fix this problem"
My overall experience is good .main issue i have experienced is it takes you to the targeted road but not exact to the door number..Google map is camparably more accurate to find houses
"Waze not showing congestion alert, its hard to recognise, can you update like Old system, alert congestion and other charges, this application not good as before."
Huge fan of up to date alerts to maintain focus on road ahead. Preferable graphics w mode options.
Female voices keep changing mid-sentence. It's been like this for 2 months now. You can tell this is Google owned.
"Waze route maps is not updated. I hope waze editor can refer to Google Maps and do some changes on the route maps in whole Penang, Malaysia"
"Have been using the app more than a year. I really loved it, but recently I encountered a bug that waze was constatntly saing no connection. I uninstalled the app and istalled it again and now when opening the app I am stuck on just a sec. After myltiple cahe and data deletes and reinstalls it is still stuck on just a sec screen. No workourund so far. Would definately change my review the moment I have my acces back to the app."
I have problem with waze on Android auto ever since android 12 update. Whenever i try to key i destination the waze will have issue halfway into the route. The app will act weird and finally get thrown out of the app and back to android auto home page. Even when i upgrade to android 13 the problem still persists. There is no issue if I didn't key in any destination.
"I've always recommended this app and make all family and friends install it. Started to have some issues this spring with the screen going un responsive if another app was accessed. Now, after upgrade today, can't even get the app to work. Opens and then goes into some loading screen."
"Worked brilliantly and effortlessly till recently, lovely feature camera warning, unfortunately it doesn't work since update. Anyone aware of a fix?"
"Often crashes when phones receives calls/SMS. App loses GPS signal and reconnects constantly. This is terrible when in areas of no mobile signal. Reporting events do not work in no signal areas, not even buffered for later upload. App is pathetic to navigate using voice to address, it simply does not work. App displays distracting advertising spam when stationary."
"*edit 17/8/22* the amount of times it has changed route and added more than 30 mins is extremely hazardous. Also keep in mind that this useless app doesn't clock mobile detection cameras. I've now been hit with 6 of these fines. Mostly had the phone in my hand because I had to adjust something Waze is doing. I haven't even started talking about it force closing out of nowhere, leaving me stranded in the outback. This is a walking lawsuit."
Hazards added are not shown on the map anymore. Seems like they can't wait to merge with Google maps.
"MAP language. I liked the features of the app but I cant use it because MAP is unreadable! At least integrate with auto translater of street names to english! And. Please. Before you respond with an ""answer"" at least read this answer you link to your response. Interface is fine. Fix the map. You limit your audience to locals only by making maps unable to be provided in any of worldwide languages like English f.ex"
Doesn't appear to be working properly on android auto anymore. GPS isn't updating when I'm driving. Only started happening within the last 2 weeks.
"Works great üëç it even tells you where you parked you're vehicle, the only thing wrong is the navigation needs some work as it repeats itself over n over till you've made the turn. I haven't seen one ad in this app yet & I've been using it for a few months now."
"Good app, but I have two navigation voices now. Kinda creepy and annoying. Please fix. Thanks!"
Stopped using this app. Keeps freezing on long journeys. No use whatsoever if I can't rely on it to give me directions. Gone back to Google maps which has improved significantly since I last used it.
"Waze used to be my favourite app for driving as compared to Google drive because they always show 3 options on the distance that you have an option to take. But now, I could not find the settings anymore for 3 options. It is disappointing and hope that it can be upgraded to be more better for drivers. It is also have sudden crash in the app"
"Too many times, the street is empty and waze shows red road. Google servers are underperforming."
"Great, but currently has a massive glitch with Android Auto. Constantly freezes location. Sometimes refreshes at next stoppage, sometimes not. Have cleared cache, reinstalled app and forced constant GPS and no battery optimisation. Totally unusable until this is fixed, and if/when it is, I'll change review to 5 stars."
"With every update more and more issues. Settings get lost, android auto notifications get stuck... Crazy."
"direction & adresses are getting worse & worse ! accurate address could be few blocks away, and road direction could always change at the very critical moment(30m away from 2 split roads, at the fork, it will ask u to turn left & half sec later it would say turn right). These ""accident road killer direction"" happens every now & then daily."
"Like others have noted previously. Waze freezes in Android auto. I thought it was just me, until i read others with the same problem. Its fine on its own. I won't be using Waze now until another update to trial is released. No point reaching out to support as this is obviously a bug in the code that needs resolution."
"Used to work great. The last few times I've tried to use Waze it either took me on the craziest route ( which more or less would have been a straight shot) or wouldn't even connect to GPS ( I allowed permissions,updated etc) When I tried Google Maps it automatically connected and got me where I needed to go."
"There are several issues with this app (mostly development issues). (1) Why is selecting a different starting point so hard to do?? (2) Lately the app announces arrival times alot earlier than the map shows and what is written on the screen, (3) the app use to announce if your route involved an incident, advise what the incident involved and what lane. The app is not as good as it use to be...."
"If I could give it zero stars, I would. Waze used to be a great, dependable navigation app I trusted more than Google Maps. Now it won't even start when connected to Android Auto. At least I won't be seeing ads for places I'll never eat at or go to now. If it's not fixed by the next update, I'm deleting it permanently since it's been hinky for awhile. Now go ahead and post your canned reply about going to a forum to share. Hint: if it doesn't work at all, what info I can share, right? Android 8."
"What a rubbish app. I just downloaded it and I keep on getting a ""Couldn't find a route"" error when I want to travel from Dwarskersbos to Heidelberg."
Something has changed since the update. I will be in the middle of a drive and it just stops navigating and freezes on the screen. Not very helpful when you don't know where you are.. Switch over to Google maps unfortunately.. Please fix it...üôè
"Normally this app works perfectly with my android phone and my Honda vehicle equipped with android auto. But for some reason this past weekend it did not work properly and it actually had me lost and on a highway. I did not get to my destination until 30 minutes later, and that's only because I got tired of being lost. I gave up on the app and used Google maps and I got to my destination. I'm not sure what is wrong with this app but it is definitely is getting uninstalled from my phone."
"The app does most things ok. Lane guidance could be much better. Can't report road closures (Android auto). Just giving a round icon at a roundabout is about as useful as a chocolate frog. The thick bar that stays at the bottom unless navigating is a massive eye sore and screen hog, especially in horizontal mode. When in Android auto the search bar stays the whole time, should disappear after a few seconds. PLEASE REMOVE THE ALWAYS ON SEARCH BAR ITS TERRIBLE"
"great app it will be much better if we can minimize it like google maps to be able to use it with anthor app , one you open any other app it shutsdown , google maps works on the top like a minimize screen"
"For short~4 hours trips, the routing is ok. For longer routes, the results are pretty strange. I prefer straight/fast routes than countryside roads."
Lately (last 6 months) app has been very slow. So slow that it's not usable. So I've switched back to Google maps.
Will not run in the background. Will not show traffic. It's no surprise Google maps is owned by Google and so is Waze. Maps is a garbage app and now so is Waze. Google just screws up everything it gets its hands on.
"Great App but one suggestion what I hope can pass the very full community website is: scheduled driving is only usefull when all minutes are selectable, the standard UI minute wheel should been used in the app."
"After update, I can no longer open Waze to simply look up an address or directions without location being on. I do this frequently, so that's a big annoyance"
"Waxa is my guide since 2018 till now, like I moved out from qatar to USA.. when I arrived here, I don't know the city that I came.. so I downloaded my Waze, I was using it, when I was in Qatar.. so right here, right there, it gives me whole lot of navigation.. So I wanna say Thank you for the team who created such amazing App.. üôèüôèüôè."
"Good app, but lately, the notifications that pop up don't go away, which then can't pick up the rest of the cameras or parked cars, etc."
"Great reliable app, but please stop with the annoying point reward system. Nobody wants a sound every 30s while driving."
"It's a good GPS, but when faced with internet slowdowns, it's much more difficult to guide the route than the competitor (Google)!"
I was starting to get sick and tired of Google Maps sending me in the wrong direction and totally out of my way and also tried to make me do a left hand turn on top of the West Westgate bridge here in Melbourne Australia and contacted Charlie Brown a IT who is heard on radio station 3AW Melbourne an expert who advised me to use Waze and I am totally impressed with this navigation app.
It was great until recently where the app keeps on crashing and loves to give more expensive and longer routes rather than those without tolls and shorter distances.
Worked great for a year. Not so much with new phone. Lost ability to open sound and voice option.
"I have just installed this app, one thing I don't understand is, why it asks for your date of birth while it assigns your login with the Google account anyway? My personal info has nothing to do with the navigation function, so why collecting it? Sounds dodgy and unjustified, unless the aim is to sell it to some third party. Or is the app going to send a report to police if my age is under 18? Nothing about this issue in the T/C. Just wondering... Might be a good apo otherwise."
Excellent I've been using for a year now and I've had no problems I think it's best sat nav there is always precise tells me everything I need to know 1 thing I would love to see is more voices celebs or just other ones but I love this app will always be using ‚ù§Ô∏è
Kinda dangerous when you tell Android Auto exact location and waze gives you a 200 line list and not the exact location which you have to figure out on the car dash Google maps doesn't have that issue.
Great app use it every day the only thing I wish the audio player was just a bit larger in landscape it's a little small and hard to see but other than that this is a great app
I use it everyday for work. Love it for the cops üòâ Sometimes it don't take you to the right place but then ill switch to Google maps. Nothing is perfect but it my app of choice
"100x better than Google maps Thank you for the great app that I've used for many years. Please allow us to have more than one ""work"" address, for those of us working multiple jobs."
great at first...then comes all the pop up ads...unsafe especially when you are driving and the ads keep popping up on the screen..if not fix i will be deleting it
Music apps will no longer connect through Waze at all. It will also not allow me to Uninstaller connections to previous music apps.
Re-routing freezes. Every single time re-routing Waze freezes. Can't tap on either choices. That's all I can say for now!
"Excellent app, only one I use. Ads in use is a distraction whilst driving, even when stationery as it distracts you."
Requires louder volume or more options in the voice options. I can't hear the instructions sometimes and it has been like this for years. When are you guys going to look at this?
Overall it's fine but lately its not updating if I wanna take a different route it will send me back to the original route even though it will take another 30 minutes And on a side note I think it's time for waze to get a truck route as well
"First of all, THANK YOU for NOT telling me to type and drive anymore since I'm the passenger in the vehicle! Sadly I cannot update my Waze profile image, I guess I have to update my Google account."
Android Auto could be better. But why can't I set my favourite gas station like I used to? The option seems to be be disappeared. I have a company car so I need only one gas station brand to be shown.
"Very helpfull, only 1 problem - cannot be used if no internet connection. It would be great to have off-line maps to be able to use with no access to Internet."
Latest version update: Encounter routing issues when launching Waze navigation in-app from foodpanda rider app. The determining best routing is suspension indefinitely and have to force close Waze.
"The function ""automatically turn on battery saver"" doesn't work. Every time I'm open waze i have to do it manually."
Infinitely better than Google maps as it doesn't have all the local advertising clutter. I want maps not a local marketing page.
Not showing closed reads. All is well except for closed roads ath the moment. Google maps is showing road closures but Waze isn't. Any ideas ?
"Just two suggestions: First, give us the option of selecting left ot right shoulder when reporting a hazard. Second, PLEASE add rest areas to route!!"
I never thought I would want to rate a navigation app. This app is the best to use in Dubai. Their latest world cup commentary option is a strike of genius and makes the commands way more fun.
"I've only been using this app a little while. A few things it lacks for my purposes is to be able to view the steps ahead of time, and at least this last time, I was unable to tell if my destination is on the right or left. Can this be changed?"
"I love this app. I won't drive without it. customizable, and warns you about potential hazards on the road (like construction, cops, even roadkill lol) way better than google maps"
"Applications okay unless you're reporting stuff then you get in trouble for reporting too much stuff and they want to block you. What use is it to report stuff if they don't want your reporting it or you're doing it ""too much""? I'm just going to go back to regular Google maps."
"Constantly freezes during drive, then occasionally catches up when stopped. Frustrating to say the least."
It's a great app but the navigation is terrible with Waze often taking a route that does not make any sense at all.
So I just found this place in Alaska called GG441 and it seems to be some sort of testing place for the developers other than that cool find I've had a great experience with waze üòä An edit if you search atqasuk in Alaska then zoom out you should find it then het show on map after hitting the three dots
"GPS issues. Used to be fine, but the app is now either too far behind, or putting me on different roads that I'm not on. Not having the issue with Google Maps"
A little too aggressive. Not too flexible. Subbern. Tested in a long trip against G. Maps. The last offered better solutions.
"As good if not better than Google Maps. It's updated, let's you know speed limits and if roads are closed off."
Something not right. Only can use in invisible mode. There is no option to switch in to visible mode! Samsung s22 ultra
"What happen to waze? It keep lost connection and need to login again, when login it keep popping up connection lost. Pls waze team fix this problem ASAP, already 2 update doesn't fix this issueüòê"
Currently Waze and Android auto have a huge lag in map and destination updates. This is happening with my Google 7 pro phone. Please help resolve soon.
"Lately, it will use 2 different voices. It might use one voice to say, ""In 1000 feet"" and another voice will say, ""Turn right."""
Hasn't tracked correctly in a month. Seems to be delayed. This issued happened before about a year ago but was fixed. It was broken about 2 patches ago again
"I use mine via android auto,  and the last few days, any alert I get, on the left hand side, will not clear until I cancel route and restart  Waze was last updated 6 days ago and was working fine before this"
No longer working with Android Auto. The app is just no longer compatible for some odd reason. Please fix it.
Before we used to use this app with ease but lately it gives us peculiar directions sometimes leads to dead end or much longer way.. and it doesn't give us route suggestions using national highways like nlex or slex!
"3 times now I've selected a specific route to drive home from Cleveland to Columbus. Via 71 only. It still takes me on the route I did not select, 77 to 71."
"Generally, it works well. But it also likes to take you off of main roads, and put you on side roads that are longer and just as slow."
Can't beep at drivers! It's greyed out and online forums suggest a lot of users have had this issue for years and waze developers have not rectified the error.
"App keeps losing signal on Android Auto, making it frustrating to use. Maps just keep freezing on Android auto."
Horrible navigation. Made my 5 mins drive to a 1 hrs drive as it fails to show the dividers clearly and slow to respond. Uninstalling it now.
Usually my primary navigation app. After getting a Pixel 7 and logging in it keeps crash looping. I'm bummed out :(
"Why is the ""Search"" bar so big on Android Auto? It takes up the top quarter of the screen. A simple magnifying glass icon would suffice."
"I set bad rating only to bring Waze attention, I will change it to 5 once you respond. The problem is I can't change fuel type anymore, the option is gone from the menu. Please bring it back or tell me where you hid it üôÇ"
Really like the app but sometimes I have to revert to Google maps so I can see points of interest as I'm driving in a new area.
I'm using it for bolt. Lately it takes longer routes unnecessary. I noticed when I was driving in my area. Please fix it....
"Please put back the old UI. Now, I can't even see the arrow on my small phone. It is behind the big rectangle for the indications :("
Not giving a direct route since last update. Takes me through to many back streets when there are no issues with the direct route.
"On android auto, It will show one speed camera on then the animation will get stuck on not shown the next ones till i cancel route and re-route, pls fix"
"What happens with Jane voice that changes in the middle of a trip with an annoying voice? Please fix that, it's very ugly voice what interrupt the other original voice."
"Cant put more than 2 destinations in a single app launch, very buggy. Needs improvement."
Phone restarts every 10-15 mins when I use Waze for navigation since the last update. Please fix this bug.
Horror and horrible I can't even log in it say it send a code to email that I never received this app is becoming a pain in the rear it use to be good and work awesome key word use too no after update it a pain
"Waze has become like all other nav apps, they sold out to the gas companies. It always puts me on the longer route even when the short route is the same time."
User interface is not convenient to use and not upto the mark. It is difficult to understand the UI of this app!
"I loved Waze and use it extensively BUT recently I bought a Pixel 6 and find that Waze freezes constantly when used with Android Auto. I don't know if it's a Pixel issue, Android Auto issue or what."
Waze is very good. They track your vehicle so they know where are you going. They also know where the traffic starts and where it ends.
"Completely broken on Android auto. Either doesn't even fire up the application or stops updating location on the screen after few minutes. Tried different platforms with the same results GM MyLink, MBUX, Ford Sync, Uconnect."
Newest update did NOT fix the two different navigation voices still happening. Fix this!
I was informed that Waze is managed by volunteer editors. The information is not always accurate. I tried to provide a correction numerous times on a route that I travel daily but received a rude response. There are other options and I am opting to use one after giving my review. Trust these volunteers if you want.
"I'd rate them higher if their user interface and reporting errors was simpler. I've tried reporting their routes through restricted roads, but ""computer Carl"" gets involved with endless requsts for extraneous information. In addition, on our recent trip they had me covering 510 miles inv2 hours."
LOVE Waze! In my experience it's super accurate and up to date! Never had a single issue with it.
I use Waze nearly all the time because of the speed limit audible notification which I started using in the UK and now back in Australia.
"Brilliant app , only thing I'm think needs improving is the lack of speed camara announcements, other apps such as tomtom and navmii have it."
Address sent from my phone to waze via Android auto aren't recognized. I have to manually enter every address. Quite frustrating.
Not accurate on the fastest route or the easiest route. Especially on the road closed and private subdivisions or executive villages
"Why this application doesn't show traffic all around? It hasn't been the first time, where i looked through the map, didn't saw any traffic in the direction I wanted to go, but when I turned that way (no way turning back) the whole street became red for almost 1+ km. Why? I often need to open google maps to check nearby traffic instead..."
The alternative route don't seem to work properly with the latest few updates. Avoid tolls don't work anymore and I need to enable avoid motoways as well. Previously it works and show 3 other route options and untolled motoways. Just avoiding tolls.
"I am using an Android phone and I have noticed that the App is no longer updating live reports such as police reports, traffic jams, crashes, road closures or other relevant issues. The issue used to appear on the map right away with corresponding icons once reported but this is no longer the case"
"Please remove the giant ""where to"" button. I don't use your app for navigation and would rather have my screen real estate back."
Did not work at first. After 3 installs seems to work now. Maybe weak signal but Google Maps worked ok.
It's the best navigation app I've used so far... Easy to understand. Great traffic updates. And it tells you about Pot holes and speeding cameras üì∑
It was 5* before the latest update. Get rid of the stupid alert carousel immediately and employ someone who has actually driven vehicles.
App doesn't work with android auto always crashes and very laggy while in use have tried clearing cache forcing stop and uninstalling and reinstalling
"Recently the warnings stay permanently on the map while driving, red lights warning etc... When is Waze getting EV charging stations in The Netherlands? Only thing I miss..."
"I used to love Waze, but for the last 6 weeks it has intermittently frozen when linked with Android Auto, making it completely useless. Unplugging the phone provides a very, very temporary solution but I can't unplug my phone every 30 seconds while driving. I've switched back to Google maps."
"Doesn't decide route based on time but purely based on distance. as a result, it routes you through city center instead of taking bypass, ring roads"
Needs clean up and simplification to UI but the app saved me from Google maps inefficiencies giving false information and doubling my routes
"Dissapointing , This used to be a great app , however , it has a lot of glitches lately, The first one is the arrow icon. all that is showing me is a circle not an arrow , i tried changing it to other icons but it is still not working , using the circle is so confusing that i used google naps instead to reach my destination"
I kant start it! After reinstating I have the same problem. Its blocking itself at the license and terms part everytime. (galaxyS9+)
This app used to work really well with Android Auto in my car but the past 2 weeks it just keeps my position at the start location as soon as it starts and if it does move my position it locks up at that point again making it totally useless. I have even done a Google pixel monthly update during this period hoping that would fix it but it didn't
"Well done, keep up the good work! Great for driving in the UK. Beats Google maps in all aspects."
"Trying it again. If it's not better the 1st time I use it, I'll uninstall again, for good this time. It's been a long time, so I'm looking forward to giving it another go, after disliking it when it was new!"
"I love the app. Very helpful no matter where you go. I can't choose the fuel type for my car anymore, what happened ?"
"Just updated from a very old version that worked fine. Now waze drops GPS the second it maps a route making the new version worthless. Restarted phone, Uninstalled (lost all saved addresses btw) reinstalled, restarted, blah blah blah. This version is a worthless buggy pos that couldn't help you find the next block if it were visible."
Plan a ride feature now working. Says something went wrong. Tried to reinstall the app and not working still.
"So buggy. This used to be my favorite navigation app but something has changed in the last year or 2. Lately it crashes all the time, restarts, and even can't connect to my network even with 5 bars. It has lost utility."
Sometimes showing crazy way it took much time and expense. Need to upgrade more navigation system.
"Overall, very good, but a big still exists. Alerts remain on screen even after passing the speed camera. Would really like to have feature to zoom in/out when car is moving as it really helps to be able to see the route ahead. Nearing the destination, there's too many Parking suggestions and these icons block the route graphics. Smaller icons or turn off these suggestions"
Mapps needs an update...still handy for avoiding blue or red revision mirrors. but Also the optional voices overs have annoying bugs
Whenever I use Waze it tells me to turn right when I know to turn left. It wants to send me a completely different way than the way I need to go. On several occasions it had me turn off at the wrong exit. I was supposed to turn two exits further down. Directions are wrong.
I just installed Waze because I've been hearing good reviews. Well it's not loading the first screen... it's staying black so I closed the app and started it over and now the from page comes up but then just stays loading? For 15 mins it keep loading. I'm gonna close it again then try starting it again layer tonight if it doesn't work again I'm uninstalling it.
"This app isn't very good. It doesn't let you put in two locations to view a route, you can only stay from where your are at. And you can't put in a location and zoom out very far to see what's around. As far as giving direction to a place it's average."
"Deleted my old 5 star review from 11 years ago to leave this. I swear Waze had gotten dumber over time. I lost count the number of times it has made me drive around in circles or given unclear/confusing directions and made me miss a turn lately. Every time it makes me ""preview location"" instead of just NAVIGATING TO THE ADDRESS I TYPED IN I want to throw my phone out the window. I've had enough, after a decade of being my main GPS, Waze has been uninstalled."
"I love using Waze but this update has made reporting hazards a lot harder. I REALLY wish we could report using Google assistant with Android Auto but we can't. Also the sub menus for reporting makes it extremely unsafe while driving. For example, if I want to report a stalled vehicle I have to press Hazzard, then select stalled vehicle, then select stalled vehicle on shoulder. That's 3 different times I have to look at my car screen to report just 1 things. It's too much."
Unbelievably bad UI! Can't set up a route from any other location than the current location. Can't find gas stationn from any other place than around my current location. Freezes while calculating route. Incomprehensible terminology completely unlike any other app. Total garbage!
"I edited my review: now I can turn off red light camera alerts and leave only speed traps and police warnings. Otherwise great navigation app, unbeatable live traffic calculations. Only glitch I got is with Android auto - it can't lock my location and recalculates in a loop while in the meantime Google maps works perfectly fine. As long as I switch to Google maps and than back to Waze - location lock works perfectly. Can live with that! Thanks!"
"So much potential, so poorly made. Unnecessarily complicated compared to Google maps, and it barely works better when it works. Continually getting worse all the time. Struggles and constantly freezes when using Android auto. Can't even use it to drive home today because it has my route starting from Utah while I'm in Texas"
"I'd give Waze 5 stars if it had some additional functions that Google maps has, as Waze is owned by Google why not have the same functionality? Firstly, no option to download offline maps/route in case of loss of mobile signal/coverage. Secondly, have a preview of the route, showing alternative routes/options showing the different eta so we can choose."
Multi point travel was not quite friendly as I can't set different route setting on each different route destination. Not always show available routes with specific settings but only pick the one that is longest even if I already know I had a shorter route I can get with same settings. Even google maps gives more options for me to choose.
I love the app I hate the app. What stinks is that they can't invest in a proper interface for making corrections. The setup is not intuitive and should be merged with GoogleMaps. Terminate Waze. It's a horrible interface and concentrate all efforts on one product.
"The app is great, however my app is bugging since I downloaded it and it only stay on the ""just a sec"" icon. I can't use any features. I already contacted the customer service who told me to send data and everything which I did, they said they will fix the problem but it isn't solved."
"Ads pop up when you stop and then won't clear when you're moving again. When this happens, all other functionality ceases until the app is restarted. All updates are made and rebooted several times. The app is completely unusable."
"This app has started crashing a lot, which is very stressful because I can't always pull over to turn it on again. This problem has made the app pretty much unusable. I think I will have to resort to Google Maps from now on, just for more stability."
"I've been using this because I don't like google maps. I wish they will update waze and put the stop signs and traffic lights too like google/apple maps do. I wish it will also say which lane (1st,2nd,3rd,4th) before your next turn to prepare you on your next turn you know what I mean because I always do it myself like I check which way to go next (left/right). I am still waiting for waze to update the app. Thanks."
Seriously?? I get ads for recommended places that block the view of where I'm going! If I wanna go to the ER that's 10 minutes away I would've flipping asked to go there! When I swipe it away it just asks me again a few minutes later!! Unacceptable for a maps app uninstalled never to be redownloaded.
"Was working ok but now won't load maps to fully show route. So, you see part of the route and the rest is gray void. Sadly I'll be forced back to Google Maps. EDIT...I clicked your link, all I get is a blue and a green field, blank. So much for your link. Not sure why I'd need to use that link, I'd already deleted and downloaded Waze fresh from App Store. You don't provide the latest version there? Edit, your Report An Issue link doesn't work, blank screen. Sent email, no help there. Useless!"
"App has been taking me to the incorrect locations as of late, as well as opting to take longer routes to my destination. Not sure what is going on with the software, Waze has always been my go to for navigation."
"Best navigation app. The alerts are great which are dependant on other users reporting. I even use this app when I already know my way as the alerts are awesome! This app lets you know when there's a speed camera fixed or hidden, police, red light camera, pot holes, object on road, vehicle stopped on side of road, flooding etc. It even lets you know how much the toll fees are on your trip if you're allowing it to use toll roads. Keep up the great work üëå"
Thank you for having the persistent search bar time out. Nice. The fly in the ointment is still having the vehicle type forced on. This should be set in options or initial setup. It imposes on the screen real-estate we paid for.
"Used to be a great app. Lately, if an ad shows up it will freeze all other functions and lock me out. I have to restart the app just do anything. Also, can you guys please make it so that the Spotify player stays on top regardless of what other activity is going on?"
"This app USED to be amazing. So user friendly, so much helpful info. Now... the past few months it is USELESS. Map never loads properly, or it loads but you never move, just spins you in circles. User info on traffic doesn't show. Location never changes. Whatever you did to this app... whoever you are.. you need to be fired."
"Since my Android was updated to v.12, I can't connect GPS to Wase, I mean, oddly enough, it get on sometimes but it's like 1 in a 100 times. All other navigation apps work perfectly on GPS and all tests I made show GPS is running normally on my phone. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times but didn't get anything fixed"
This app closes every few minutes so the user has to keep opening it while driving. It's not the phone. It is waze. Google Waze keeps crashing/closing. Been this way since 2019. Stop working on every other bug until this one common and documented bug is fixed.
"Waze use to be awesome - my favorite traffic app by far. Since Google acquired the company, the app has progressively declined. Incorrect rerouting is the biggest issue and have been experiencing odd app glitches. Not to mention the constant upsell to Google maps. It is clear Google acquired waze to integrate the app with their maps app, or to slowly kill waze over time to get users on Google maps. So disappointed. Was my favorite, now Uninstalling. Why didn't you just leave it alone google?"
"Been a faithful Wazer from the beginning, but latest update causes the app to lose or not have a GPS signal, thus the app technically works, but setting a destination works, but once you move your location never changes. PLEASE fix would prefer to keeping using Waze, but not really giving anyone a choice."
"Good mapping tech. The customization and the ability to add to the road database is top-notch. My only complain is no sattelite view while driving. (Unless I missed it, if I did, 5 stars, until then I'll stick with Google)"
"1 problem with this navigation app! First of all, I would like to say that Waze is the best navigation app out there! But this is the problem: everytime I have this app running on the background on my device, as I am driving there will be a police speed camera vehicle parked on the road and this application sometimes does not make you aware of the police and you will end up getting caught as a result of relying on this app! Quite a few times now the app has not notified me about the police!"
"I've used this app for years without issues, but after getting a Pixel 6a it will no longer work. After setting up the 6a and opening Waze the map would load, then freeze. Unplug phone, replug, open Waze and the map would freeze. I uninstalled then reinstalled Waze, now it won't even open on my phone ."
"It needs a little more, I want to like it more. It requires an offline mode, I have found several times I have gone somewhere for a day out, say the beach or a country park, and there is very limited data signal, and the app will not let you plan a new route."
"Way out of date. I pass by a round about everyday to work. The round about is closed since a week yet everyday the app choose the route that pass by it! Also, when I try to open it when the internet reception is not good. It became sluggish and freezes!"
"I've change my rating from 5 to 4 Every time Google thinkers with this app, it becomes a little less useful. It's still way better than Google maps, but it seems they are trying to slowly move users to Google Maps and the feature they are ""stealing"" from Waze Annoyance: The map turns gray when you have the music app show info continually. why, Why, WHY? Why is he drawing for the road sign of the next exit so miniscule until just before approach the exit? It should be a little larger and readabe"
Android seem to have fixed their issue with the app still being functional when a call comes in. Overall the waze app is very good. Would be a good idea if you could personalise the screen with the main issues that get reported rather than having the distraction of going through menus.
"The detours straight up lie to you. It said it added 4 minutes when it added 15, making me late my first day of work. Plus the adds pop up at the worst times, making you have to concentrate on getting rid of the add instead of the road, making you miss an exit or worse, get in a wreck. This app is a sham. Don't waste your time on it"
"This use to be a good app before Google bought it. As a truck driver I've finally had enough of the Waze app issues. It's just not a reliable GPS app. So I've downloaded ""Hammer"" which is a FREE trucker friendly GPS app with tons of truck options. I am much happier with Hammer as my go to GPS app and I recommend any truck driver looking for a good reliable GPS app do the same. And the Waze mods can save their responses. No one wants to go to Facebook to message you about an issue with this app"
The app has been broken for a couple of weeks. The car just stops moving on the map and only updates every 3 or 4 minutes. No use if you're in an area you don't know. Had to move to Google maps which isn't as good as waze used to be.
"Since yesterday it acts up together with Android auto. Not showing the speed limit anymore, problem with the navigation, have the screen is not readable. Workaround so far is a forced restart. However once you stopped and plug the phone in again it is again broken."
"Was great, latest update has caused issues with tracking vehicle movement. Get stuck on same location, worse when putting a route in and wanting directions. Only advice is turn phone off or reinstall. Done this 10 times over now and still am issue. Yes location tracking is on when using app always...."
Can't use voice commands to make reports. 'Error cannot find position on map'. Latest update has not fixed this. Also latest update now puts navigation slightly to the right of the screen when in landscape. Tablet for example.
I've stopped using this. It's routing isn't always the best route and the voices have gone up the wall. It's just annoying having the voice constantly changing from female to male. Google maps seems better at the moment.
"Navigation has got worse, took me for a world tour yet couldn't reach my destination. Luckily I'm riding a motorcycle, I can use shortcuts & ride against traffic. If someone labeled the destination wrongly, user can't report so that it can be amended. Some idiot labeled the shop branch located at Equine Park ie. BakeTouch @USJ Taipan, this 2 location is almost an hour away."
Very helpful especially when it's my first time going to an address. Also let's me know when there are road blocks or traffic. Gives reminders and alerts for number coding and is user friendly. The only downside for me is how this app takes too much of my phone.
"The map editor is not the greatest. The videos offer no real help or starting point. I can't edit an area because it's not local to me, even though I frequent the area. Just trying to change a street name that changed more than 10 years ago. Edit. Street name still not changed."
"I don't know what's been happening with this app as of lately, but if it wasn't for the plan my trip feature I would have deleted waze. The lag time and inability to connect is anger provoking and defeats the purpose of having a navigation system."
"Used to be ok, seems to be getting worse and worse. Today gave me 200+km 3h directions and Google maps gave me 190km 2h20min directions. Also glitchy and annoying menus. Two stars because it's good for free driving without directions to get warnings on the road. Directions are terrible though so uninstalling."
"It's indispensable for its crowdsourced reporting. It is kind of quirky, but I can live with that. It does tend to reroute quite frequently which can be a tad annoying, and occasionally tries to make me do physically impossible turns, but all in all is my favourite nav app."
"Updated review: The app continues to lose my location when connected to Android Auto. It basically works 50% of the time and the only way to get it working once it fails, is to disconnect/reconnect my phone from AA. It's ridiculous."
"The ads glitch and remain for 20+ minutes, covering half the map. There's no x or other way to close the ad, even after you select it. This is really distracting and makes it difficult to focus on the road."
"I was able to use Waze to plot and follow a course from Breaux Bridge, LA to Greensboro, NC. I'm returning home tomorrow and it's having a problem plotting a route to go back home. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed in this app. I'll switch back to Google Maps now. It's never done that to me."
Doesn't work properly in Android Auto. There is a problem between Google assistant and Waze. Google assistant recognises and says it will set the location but Waze comes up with different locations. Really annoying. Please fix it. It fails 100% of the time. Umm your reply is unrelated to my problem.
"New UI updates hide functionality and settings. Makes it hard for quick adjustments. Plan a Drive (drive later/arrive by) constantly gets updated, and gets worse! Stop breaking it! It used to work, until you guys messed with it."
"Used to use this all the time, now I can't use it at all .. Constantly having ""connecting"" displayed at the top and having navigation issues so I uninstalled it. After uninstalling and reinstalling, despite having strong 5g signal I'm being told there's no internet connection when I load Waze up. Will probably leave it uninstalled now..."
"My phone GPS doesn't work but Waze doesn't audibly tell you when navigating. Just a tiny red error bar which you wouldn't see if you were driving. Also when Waze doesn't know your location, it just freezes telling ypu to navigate straight. So I ended up of course following Waze not knowing Waze didn't know my location. Sort your error state UX out, at least Google Maps audibly tells you GPS connection lost. Uninstalled"
Often loses network connection even when 4G/LTE connection is good and wifi turned off. Have to mess with the app while driving. Cannot search and add for gas stop while driving via Android Auto. Sometimes suggests weird older roads in poorer condition than the main roads and I have to switch to an old fashioned gps app to check the easier route.
"On my Samsung SM-A516U running Android v12, in last month or so my GPS disconnects intermittently. It works fine with other apps that also use the GPS feature (i.e. Google Maps). This is very frustrating. I have to switch to Google Maps until this issue gets corrected."
"Used to be my go to, but now it's not working correctly. The ads that pop up while stopped do not go away and block the map. The only way to get rid of them is to restart the app. Which really isn't convenient. And you can't get to the music icon while the ad is there."
Laggy slow updates. Predictions are off and some roads are jammed up and Waze says clear and opposite happens as well. Android Auto interface is another issue. no options to show the reports on the route unlike the one shown on mobile app when I click on the directions
"Now the ""where to"" box and ""My Waze"" boxes just sit blocking part of the map. Used to auto hide. Can't find any way to hide so map is now near useless (mainly an issue in landscape mode). This appears to be a deliberate (dumb) change. Stupid badges or prizes pop up and distract from the road. I'm not 5 years old and it would be great if Waze was targeted at adults instead. Reinstalled to fix perm. invisibility issue and lack of audio alerts."
"After recent updates, Waze no longer maintains current GPS location while connected to Android Auto. Works normal when disconnected, so it's not app permissions. Basically useless at this point since I can't drive and look at my phone. Please fix your integration with AA."
"The application is good, but the ones at the bottom of the screen, respectively my waze and the location, should no longer exist, just to be full screen. Maybe an update would solve the problem, just to keep the map on the screen simple."
"Its mot possible to verify an account. The app requires a four digit code. The emails do not supply that code, giving a link instead. The link takes to the app requiring the four digit code. So on short the app thinks the email has a code, which it does not. Simple error caused by no user testing"
"Recently, it keep say ""No GPS. Showing approximate location"". When clicked recenter it show totally wrong location which is far away from my current location. Due this error, I'm not able to the navigation at all. And I'm 100% my Location/GPS is switched on."
"It has stopped allowing me to run it on several devices at the same time, which has created hazardous situation, when both my wife and myself were driving different cars with both phones and Waze applications on my name. This is ridiculous! Why such a stupid restriction for no reason and without any warning!"
In recent days I've noticed that the speed display disappears from the map for varying periods then reappears without any input from me. This is very frustrating as I only use this GPS generated speed reading because the vehicle's speedometer is inaccurate by around 5%.
"Waze has always worked brilliantly and accurately but recently it's voice guidance has been intermittent in that it would announce ""in two hundred meters"" and then stop not advising if I'm supposed to turn left or right. You can see the problem with that."
"Was great, and still try to use but there is now a bug somewhere. Constantly freezes while driving. Your location only updates every now and then. Have all the correct background settings, but this doesn't fix it."
This has to be the worst GPS app I have ever experienced. I put in an address and it take me to a completely different address on the wrong street. Not even close. Only good thing is the police alerts and shows your speed and the speed limit.
"Very bad option for share location, and it was much better when the search engine was at the top of the screen, there should be an option to locate a problem on a neighboring road where we are not driving but have noticed a danger, it's also very hard to save to favorites the place I'm at right now."
"First time installing app, it keeps saying ""Just a sec"" but never showing me the map. Can't do anything in that screen. If I toggle to another app and come back it is just black screen. Phone OnePlus 8. Please fix and I'll change my review, thanks. Edit 3: No link was resent from developer's response that had a broken link. No response from ticket made with screenshots other than the automated response. Issue still present, not only for me but for countless others. Just look at the other reviews"
"Love this app but it really needs the option to mark people walking or biking on the roads, or at least announce notes out loud. I often see people on dangerous roadways. with how often people text and drive I think this is a very important feature that should be added"
"if you are in the US and anywhere near Canada it will force you ro route through Canada. even with manual mapping it will endlessly route you through Canada. there is almost nothing you can do to make it not route thru Canada. it has been like this for at least a year. people complain about it on their site. they still wont fix it. somehow manages to make google maps look good. Still trash but at least they deleted my account. 8/22 response from waze 100% not related, get better bots."
"Not very useful for city/suburb driving. Constantly redirecting, trying to turn me around or leading me to a destination that has nothing to do with where I am going. Yesterday it tried to tell me I was at my destination when I was still 10 miles away. Not inpressed."
"The app works fine, but there's an issue with the Bluetooth connection in my car (BMW with iDrive 6) where only the navigation sounds will be played, but none of the notification sounds will be played (police, speed cameras etc.), neither through the phone nor the car speakers. The notification settings in the app are set to ""alert while driving"". I've tried with both ""Play sounds to phone speakers"" on and off, but it didn't help."
"At the beginning This navigation tool dont know where your device is facing, And dont have compass. And you'll ended up proceeding on wrong way so you have to find a U-turn. And if you didn't noticed it. You will end up getting more kilometers on changed of navigation way."
"Suddenly the list in ""Toll and HOV passes"" disappeared. Now I can't see the passes I own nor the other available local passes regardless if I press ""Show all"". I have the latest update and tried rebooting the phone with no luck. Without this the app is useless and I am going to remove it."
"I been using this app for many years,I was really satisfied with its operation but recently I noticed the blunders in this app, it doesn't take you the best route anymore, infact on some occasions it don't give you choices of more then one route and you know that's not the best route, it has also taken me in middle of nowhere few times even with full postcode and road names entered correctly."
Waze is brilliant but I would love if it had satellite view or a way to see individual houses on the map as I mostly use it for pinpointing Deliveries. I just have to keep going back to Google maps to get this and it's the only thing holding me back from using Waze full time over Google maps.
"Fix it please! Keeps freezing on Android Auto has been for months now. Hard to think a Google company cannot get to the bottom of it, more interested in rolling it out fully on Apple play. What was the best navigation app is now the worse it's just unusable."
"If you need to avoid cops, sure. If you're in a country that uses Waze a lot, again, sure. Otherwise Google maps is much better. Waze loves taking you on wild journeys through side streets that it thinks will save you time. It won't. It screwed me up enough times. Only use it for the aforementioned scenarios above."
"They have this special ""you are an idiot"" feature which is a constant popup if you want to share your location. You can change your location icon to a person confused about gender, but not turn off the ""you are an idiot"" feature popups. Is this app a virus? Yes. Does this app show full screen ads while you are driving instead of assisting you with directions because they want to harm you and your family. Yes. Will they reply to this rating with ""email us so we can help"" even when not. Yes."
Okay the app and it's directions are overall very good 4.5 stars on that HOWEVER The Voice. The VOICE. The new update includes an exceedingly annoying voice. At least here in Qatar. That is just so singsongy and incredibly annoying. Ugh! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE üôè CHANGE THE VOICE.
"Impossible to Sign Up: Avoid! Impossible to use (many with same issue). Gets stuck on enter age dialogue when creating a new account. Have to use something else instead. Being asked to use Facebook when you don't use that solve a support issue is a waste of time. Lots of people having same issue, all over forums so not just me!!"
"One of the best Navigation apps ive ever used! Sometimes theres a connection issue, but its not often. Also love the interaction you can do in-app such as change car, character, edit profile etc. Keep up the great work!!!"
"Works great. (But latest releases have made it worse. It shouldn't direct me to drive in the carpool lane. UPDATE. Make sure you have set a vehicle type that isn't motorcycle... ahem. Likely pilot error on my part.) And I still wish it wouldn't try to flog products while I'm driving, but that's about all that's wrong with it."
Does not work with an s10. It keeps saying just a sec and then goes into a spin and never loads. This was from the most recent update. C an someone from the Google team please help. This seems to be a known issue!!!!!
"Could be perfect if they added navigation to electric car public charging points like they do for gas stations, and the ability to add more than just one stop at a time. Otherwise it's by far my favourite navigation app"
App has continuously locked up for the past month while using it with Lyft. After it locks up I can't use it at all. Thought it was due to the location I was in recently but I've returned home and having the same problem? The problem returns no matter how many times I reinstall or restart my phone.
"Hi! Its been 3 weeks from now i still cant use my Waze app, I already did all of the troubleshooting that i have to do but it still wont work. It only shows the ""Just a sec"" screen and it cant be touch any button on it. Hope you can help me with this."
"I went on a short drive on well traveled roads today. Waze told me incorrect directions. Waze gave me about 2 seconds before telling me where to turn. Waze took a very roundabout way to get me to my second destination and then when I drove by it, it never said anything. Well it did try to send me back a mile (only one place like this so it was lost). Then told me to turn the wrong way even if it was trying to route me again. Not to mention when it started rapid firing rights and lefts. It sucks."
Tried to use it twice. First time I input the address of a POI and it failed. Tried it multiple times and nothing. Uninstalled and tried again about a month later. Tried 2 different addresses and it failed again. Uninstalled it for good.
"You're drunk, WAZE. I'm breaking up with you. I needed simple directions from point A to point B in an unfamiliar town. You, Waze, took me in a circle. It would have been so SIMPLE! When I entered the directions again, you came up with the same route. Also, you need to give turning directions sooner. ""Turn right"" when I'm 100 feet away doesn't help. I love the crowd input. I'm not firing the crowd, Waze. Just you and your screwed up directions."
"While driving and using Spotify, whenever an ad or traffic notification comes on the app will freeze. I can not get the ad/notification to disappear and can not access Spotify unless i completely turn off the app. Please fix this as i can continue to use this app on long trips"
"Adds 4 mile country detours for no apparent reason whilst the near silent voices try to instruct you with a reasonably good visual aid. Needs updating to avoid satelite generated, obvious errors which seem deliberately added. Same as all the other apps. Average assistance."
"App is great, but the new update design makes things harder to navigate, such as planning a drive and finding the best time to leave. Not impossible to navigate but a whole lot slower to set up"
"When it works it's great. I have everything updated and once the app connects to my car I can't open the app on the phone at all, even if the car gets turned off. I have to restart the phone in order for the app to let me reopen it."
Would really like to give it 5 stars. But anytime you leave the app and come back to it the app is frozen and requires you shutting it completely down and starting it backup before you can get information from the app. Which the whole process is mildly infuriating.
"Selected route without toll but changed to with toll suddenly without any notification while I'm driving. It's happened many times already. Also, failed to connect network for several times. Please fix the bugs ASAP."
"You cannot turn off construction alerts, which is insanely infuriating. There's not even an option to turn *on* voice alerts for construction in the app, and trying to remove them from the map entitely doesn't work either. Does anyone do QA on the releases?"
"The app is good, had been using it for years. However, recently I began to receive drive sharing alerts for drives that doesn't exist. And even several a day, about every hour each. It never happened before."
All of the sudden waze maps is not following current travel. It could be the update I just received from GM. But it won't follow when not connected to my vehicle. Its a great app other than this current issue that just popped up recently.
"Used to work great, gotten terrible recently. Waze used to be great at predicting the time it will take you to drive somewhere, I use it for that daily. Recently the predictions are horrible, today I checked how long a drive will take an hour before leaving, waze says 21 minutes, when I'm leaving the routes I have now say 25, I select the route and it goes to 27, the actual drive takes over 30. It's like it is deliberately under estimating drive times"
"Onlt recently discoverd waze, but love it already, the option for different voices is just awsome..im currently being navigated by the terminator himself..arnie, but i wish we had the option to download more voices to use, that would an awsome feature, imagine being navigated by deadpool, or john wick, or morgan freeman, or even samuel L jackson, if that option is able to be added, where we can download other voices...it would be awsome if you please release an update with that feature"
"Using waze on android auto on a 2019 ford focus, the speedometer shows sometimes, sometimes not at all, really bad getting a location fix as well, yet Google maps is fine, very frustrating. please fix it. Location services on and battery saver off, works fine on a poco f3"
What is wrong with route planning? My car is London ULEZ compliant and Waze correctly routes me in London. However the Birmingham ULEZ is identical but Waze insists on routing around the zone adding time and distance to the journey. Leaves me wondering about the other ULEZ zones in the UK. This does not give confidence for travelling through cities with low emission zones.
"Given 4 stars as I have used this app for years and always been great. With my Samsung s22 ultra, sadly it no longer works, just says updating and freezes. Hopefully this will be fixed soon, until then I'm having to use another app hope it can be fixed soon as I normally love this app."
"After I updated the app. while navigating the way it automatically changes the way, not one time but many times, because of it I miss the turn or take the wrong way... I uninstalled it and reinstalled it but the problem remains.. plz check"
"I like it alot. I love the fact that I can contribute to its data. I wish i had a way to make reporting a pothole faster when running on android auto. Instead of going through the hazard reporting flow, it'd be nice to have a way to add shortcuts to the top most menu for reporting things."
Disconnects several times during operation. When approach to roundabout or important area with several lanes it starts turning left and right round makes it very difficult to choose which one is my lane. Most of the time trying to connecting to server in red writing.
"I've been using waze for years, until recent update where i'm experiencing many issues such as search button cant be clicked smetimes, and the worst part for latest update my waze always says no signal. However my google maps works just fine. Seems like its time for me to say goodbye to waze"
Stopped working after the update. GPS all over the place doesn't tracker doesn't move stays frozen and then suddenly move big distance doesn't keep pace with where I'm in the car. Gome back to using Google maps. ( yes both on the same phome)
"One got to be really careful when following this GPS. It takes you to really really dangerous intersections where it is almost impossible to get across. The traffic are fast going and very heavy and then it instruct you to turn Left, then Right, that means you have to cross 4 lane of fast moving heavy traffic and to make it worse, it's a blind corner. You literally can't see more than 15 car length, with car speeding anywhere from 45 to 60 mph."
I wonder why they only give us 5 stars too work with. This app is a lot more than just a five I went ahead and purchased with a little doubt of it working any better than the others hear me and hear me well this is exactly what you NEED. It speaks very clear and most of all it gives directions loud enough to hear but in a way that you need without yelling. It is so easy to use. I didn't have to ask for help at all
Great until a couple weeks ago UGH I have an Android and Waze has always been my go to travel app. Now when I open Waze it will not let me search (no keyboard function appears) it's frustrating. Guess I have to adapt to Google maps for directions until Waze fixes the issues ....
"For last several weeks, I am unable to report any hazards while I am driving. I AM able to confirm it cancel alerts when they come up but can no longer enter my own alerts. Frustrating. Never used to have this problem."
"Terrible what a cluster fu#k to create an account using a name or email not Gmail. The voice for planed route rambles on very fast , I understood maybe two words .Tried to copy paste an address from Google maps and it shows ""around you"" map hundreds of miles away nowere close to my location or for that matter the copied address. Honestly this app is pure garbage I simple do not see what the fuss is all about. I miss my old Magellan GPS....Nope not for me"
"Great app in a nutshell. Traffic info and ETAs are good, although at times there is a quicker direction. Love the upcoming hazards warnings. Personal suggestion would be ability to increase the size of the current speed limit."
"The app is incredible. It started a bit bugging recently and crashing (huawei p30) but all in all I'm a long-term user and enjoy waze a lot. One suggestion about bonuses we get if we are active members(report crashes, police etc.) You could add a feature that with those bonuses/coins a user could buy e.g. car icons or sounds. Because now there's no real purpose to help than just to be a proactive member of the community. Please, add features which would make usage of Waze even more interesting."
"Latest update has stopped Waze working correctly on Android Auto. Had no problems with Waze previously, now it freezes and won't pick up where I am - this happens both at the start of a drive, or during a drive which is extremely frustrating."
"Today I heard some strange noice from the phone. Every 10 seconds. I thought there's a game in the background. Very annoying, almost made an accident. it turned out to be some stupid gamification in Waze that gives me +5 points (i don't even know why) Very dangerous, please remove it ASAP!"
"Waze never diverts me around congestion but yet google maps does. I will check a route before I leave where I know there is congestion just to test, gaps diverts yet waze doesn't. I appreciate the community and we update the traffic around us but surely the algorithm is meant to work its magic and keep us away from heavy traffic. Maybe I'm using it wrong but gmaps works everyday seamlessly."
"Used to be great, got simpled and dropped stuff that were moved to g maps, now it is falling badly with constant reroute on open roads with very low traffic got in a reroute bug I has to open other device and constant click go now alternatively on both devices. Probably this is the end for waze.Rip was the best navigation app before Google.Why give links in comments because they are unclickable from phone where waze works.who ever notes on paper a huge url to go there because Google is idiot"
"With my last phone update a few weeks ago the app stopped working. I tried Uninstalling and reinstalled, rebooting the phone and checked for additional updated. Had to switch to another app as it would still show me at my house even though I was 20 miles down the road. Unistalling this one."
"Extremely buggy on WebLink. It's the only app on there that won't go full screen and whenever my music is playing through it, it kicks me out of WebLink completely when the song ends. I love the ideas behind this but it's just not working."
"I was really happy with this app for more than 3 years, but the last updates makes the app very very bad, crashed when you really need it while driving, sorry I am deleting the app and moving to another one, very disappointed."
"My go-to SatNav app. Up-to-date road conditions (e,g. temporary obstructions, police activity etc.) advised and appreciated. A major failing, though, is the regular use of unsuitable (i.e. narrow, single-track) roads when re-routing."
"Keeps freezing , I have used Waze since since 2021 I have had no issues until recently. It has now started to freeze during navigation for about 2 miles then works ok fir about 3 turns then freezes again. I am seriously thinking of removing from my phone"
It's been really go to use never had any issues definitely would of been a 5 star rating if you could change the look of the maps instead of it being on the one setting would be great if you could change the map terrain other that really good to use
"I've used this for years with Android Auto, but recently it's started crashing, freezing and rebooting randomly mid journey. It's a shame as it's been great up until the last few months."
Cute and colourful but not user-friendly. Unable to update fuel price. Very often it blocks automatically during a trip or continue to loop a certain part until you switch it off. Very disappointed!!
"I try to add a stop on my trip and waze puts the 2nd stop, first. Developers need to fix that. Also, I want aware that there is no satellite view. Kinda makes it hard to see where I am going...."
"Keeps sending me towards very congested areas and narrow country roads because they are supposedly quicker, when they are anything but that."
"Seems to route into traffic much more than previously. Also, gas prices on the app are wrong at least 75% of the time."
"I did have it at 5 stars, but after yesterdays update, Waze was massively delayed on instructions. Telling me to turn well after passing the road or right at it. Not telling which direction to turn and also not informing vehicles on side of road. Looks like the update needs an update."
"Very use, 99% of the time it's accurate for traffic and mapping. Love this app."
"App is buggy and have deadspots where the location just doesnt track. It is like the app freezes. You go out of app, back in, and it tracks. As soo as you roite, it freezes. Especially on android auto."
"I love this app just as it is. I'm scared to update it. G-d forbid I get any of the issues others seem to be experiencing after they've updated. So NO THANK u!...works perfectly fine for the most part so I just don't c the point of screwing anything up by updating it. Like they say ""If it isn't broken, don't try to fix it!"""
Keeps glitching out and can't pinpoint location. Keeps telling us to turn on non existing road
Ever since Google has acquired ways it's gone to hell in a hand basket. Now the GPS is taking me through small last towns and random places that take 10 times as long
"Almost the perfect app, the personality of it , it's fun, great colors and features, only flaw I've came across is the accuracy of vehicles broke down , cops and road construction, but I guess it's to be expected, I definitely recommend over Google maps"
"My life would be complete if Waze offered an ""Optimus Prime"" voice option. Ya know, to coincide with the new Transformers movie. Hint hint. Please make it happen!!!"
Best app to get you there takes some strange routes and sometimes a little narrow but gets you there with few delays
can not set as default maps app. when ever using google search or Ok google it will default to maps making it difficult to try waze
The damn thing won't even open. nothing happens when I touch it or swipe it .it is totally useless. Uninstalled
Recently developers have feminine Jane voice speaking half of what she says in an androgenous tone. Don't mess with Jane. Just make another voice option. Please fix it.
"something strange going on - ran for nearly 3 years on a Pixel 5 with Sync 2 on my Ford Mondeo, same car but now a pixel 7 Pro and it locks up constantly"
Good overall I use it for most of my routing for work as it's easy to use and keeps up with police and road closures crashes etc. I wish there was a option under the vehicle info for commercial vehicles to get better routes as some streets are very narrow for the trucks and vans I use
Good UI but traffic lights are missing badly. Google maps exactly shows where the next traffic light is so that you get an exact idea from where you need to make a turn. In Waze you can not see any traffic light detail.
"Loved using the app, but over the last week, when using it on Android Auto, it freezes during the journey, resuming again every 20 seconds. Very frustrating, so now onto Google Maps instead"
I would give this app five stars if I could pay for it to get rid of the advertising. It really is the only part of this app that I don't like.
Constantly freezing and becoming really unreliable. Was once the best and never drove without it.
I've Loved this app ever since I started it all of a sudden the GPS has disappeared from Waze and I can't get it back it really sucks cuz I really depend on it I've tried everything to get it back and it just won't come back how can this be fixed
I enjoy using waze with Android Auto on my vehicle. Thanks for such and interactive navigation experience.
I'm a truck driver so I love the fact that it works with my trucker path app. I can bring up the truck route on that app and send it over to Waze that way I have all the benefits of the Waze app but I know I'm on a truck approved route.
Pretty annoying the fact that when you switch windows to a different app and come back to waze the app restarts like if you are just plotting your route. This happens EVERYTIME üôÑ. Also it would be nice if it was compatible with Android auto
üò† Very disappointing this apps just full of bugs can't even connect to the gps once you start to go you will stuck forever! üëé
Can you please fix the weird new voice? It's very distracting that half of my directions have one voice and half have another voice I do not like the new voice.
Since last two updates - nu real time traffic updates. Basically the app is kind of useless.
Alerts do not disappear. Red light camera speed camera alerts stay on the screen and you never see another alert unless you remove it by swiping it away
"Now it just keeps telling me I'm at my location, which is actually a mile plus down the road. Really? I am so tired of wasting gas money driving in circles, stop wasting my time and money worrying about what voice you're going to add next and worry about the actual navigation. It's my job, I deliver and I don't get reimbursed for my time, gas or aggravation using this. Google maps it is, plus they show you a photo of the pickup, so you know you're not going to the wrong place."
"Very good navigation and reports, very clear navigation, (especially places where not familiar, sometimes better than Google maps) Lately I had some issues w the connection, can close sometimes suddenly or go slow."
I have had the app since Sept. I was so impressed with the app I told everyone who would listen. Sad that I lost my HALO truck for my vehicle ‚òπÔ∏è Guess it was a temporary use? Would love to see Google maps used instead of plain map. Be nice to have visual references.
"Useless. Doesnt work with Android Auto. It'll load up, find your location, but then when you drive it is unable to track your progress on the map. It has no GPS signal whatsoever. Google maps works fine, and waze also works fine if you just use it on the phone, so the issue is its compatibility with Android Auto, which unfortunately renders this app useless. I have reported the issue but not recieved any response. What a shame"
A great app to be directed aimlessly in circles. Google maps is 1000% superior. I am deleting this app this second.
Why doesn''t WAZE install on my phone? I've sent in two codes and I still get the message that there are no devices connected. What the hell?
"Useless, doesn't work with Android Auto. Keeps telling me to sign in. But Mr Waze, I am signed in! Uninstall is the best thing."
Nowdays this app is different with before. It shows the complicated way to the destination. :(
App stopped working as it should. Just says searching for network when I am able to use my net properly for other apps. I cannot see any traffic info which is critical at this peek hour time before going to work. Just a plain ole map seen. Even cleared cache nothing still. Please fix.
"Only works with Android Auto if you remove location permissions from Android Auto. This removes some functionality from Android Auto, which is not ideal."
Voice guidance for no apparent reason becomes loud or inaudible. The volume level percentage option would be much appreciated.
Problems ... Reports are supposed to be around me but can't see any even in full country zoom out.. changed the guidance from us Jane to something else.. no way I can get Jane back
"Best navigation app I've ever used I doubt I'll ever let go of it potholes , speed traps , road construction warnings are very useful üëçüëçüëçüëç"
Won't work without creating an account. Then won't let me create an account. Why can't you use the app without creating an account? Frustrating!
"Unreliable! Sometimes, it would display routes that are farther and take longer. I couldn't figure out why. I always check all available routes to verify."
I can hardly do anything from the Android Auto screen even when I'm parked. I usually can hardly hear the app tell me about road hazards. I have the volume for that turned all the way up. Maybe I should try Google maps.
"Apparently this app isn't compatible with my Samsung phone. It says ""no GPS"". I tried reinstalling it and lots of other stGPS. The app has location settings turned on. My Google maps works just fine so I have no idea why waze can't detect my gps."
"I loved waze for about 3 years, and right now on my tablet, it keeps glitching on me. The reason is that the roads are messed up."
"Waze is constantly causing my phone to reboot. Has been doing so ever since I got my new phone. Before that I was thinking that it is android auto problem and/or my phone problem (Poco F4 GT), so I switched to Nothing Phone only to encounter the same issue. Now I am using a OnePlus 10 Pro and Waze was restarting my phone despite not using Android auto and not even being connected to a car. So it's clearly a Waze problem (maybe has something to do with android 12). Terrible, please fix"
"Love using Waze, however it keeps turning back on alerts for railroad crossings. I turn it off, but it keeps turning itself back on probably about once a month. Please fix this!!!!"
"Map keeps freezing on android auto. Its not the device, data or location, as google maps works perfectly fine. Reboots and reinstals only temp fix til it does it again. Please fix the bug."
"Terrific App, but I have 1 question. Why did you remove the 2 choices when setting up a route: faster time or faster mileage?"
"Used to work great with Android Auto, not it constaly freezes and it constantly lags. I've tried uninstalling, deleting the cache, everything. Only way to get it to work properly is not plugged into Android Auto."
Amazing app unbelievably accurate. Points out everything in detail like accident or even car parked on hard shoulder.
"Out of sudden, the apps on my phone appear ""no internet connection, please try again later"". The heck no internet. Use other apps, just fine. But waze, totally cannot use. Its a good app, but with the bug, lack here & there, its really make me going mad!"
"It's a good app at least improve on the 3D display make look more realistic and accurate,and please some local languages from Africa like Swahili or Luganda from East Africa thanks"
Don't waste your time with this app. More glitches than the matrix. Crashes all the time. I've cleared cache data. Uninstall and re installed 5 times. Now I've got to verify my email but each time it presents a code it disappears immediately so I can't actually use the app. Before all this it was great. Seems like I'm not the only one with these issues.... very poor
"Update for 2022, update reset my settings. Now get incorrect voice directions. Voice says turn left when screen shows right. Going to start using my old Garmin nuvi. Your response below is a laugh, the help link is broken and the communication link wants me to install Facebook messenger. I sent an email to support and got a noreply response. I'm surprised waze/google uses Facebook messenger. Support shouldn't be this difficult but maybe that's by design?"
"Was a go to, now it's not so great. Speed camera banner now randomly gets stuck so you get no new notifications about incidents."
"I like it because it's not a cancerous UI like GMaps has become. But I'm not sure what developer thinks they did a good job when you have to slowly type because the app can't comprehend waiting for you to stop typing before force checking if your username is available. And adding full name instead of just first, no thanks, I like my privacy, I guess you don't. I'll buy an original GPS system to avoid future UI updates."
"Lost all my trip info, cannot sign into account using google account because sends letter code but only allows numerical keyboard! Reprts no connection. Does not easily load map (if at all) using cellular data - poorly designed software. Amateur design app. Delete!"
Can't add Toll passes. The list is just empty. I had previously added passes but they disappeared. Resetting the app didn't help. Tapping 'show all' doesn't show anything.
This app cannot be solely trusted if you're traveling cross country it will suggest routes that have been closed for hours or months always always double check through other apps
"I'm always switching between this and Google maps. Waze routes are usually better, faster and traffic is more accurate, however it constantly crashes, fails to load routes, and if I see ""oops something went wrong"" one more time I'm likely to throw my phone out the window. Google on the other hand is more reliable but constantly stitches you up with routes."
"The List View and Map View in Routes don't show whereabouts the traffic hold ups are so I can divert round them. Also, how about adding a 5,15,30 minute divert round a traffic hold up so I can avoid them?"
"It used to be an awesome app. Voice assistant stopped working Switching routes can be a pain Crashes/gets stuck sometimes while driving Lane assistance used to be top notch, but it has had flaws lately"
So far I'm liking this over gmaps as I can report unlike on gmaps and quickly switch routes. But I would like to report temporary road closures due to accidents or other factors when in Android auto. Have looked but not there.
Very good app. Shows where queues/traffic and other stuff are. Allows you to play music at the same time. Even shows alternative routes so you can avoid traffic.
Lately this app keep freezes also the map display changes every time trying to use it through another driver app
"This app is saves lives, also accurate, you interact with other drivers , and post danger. Genius!!"
It's simply the best app for navigation. Even don't mind the ads as they only apea when stopped.
"Alerts no longer auto clear on Android Auto, and obvious bug. Do not upgrade!"
"Terrible navigation. This app will take you down every back alley, back country, crazy unsafe road. It intentionally avoids main roads which is absolutely dangerous as heck. Took me down the wrong side of a one-way road."
"The map and navigation functions work well. However, the crowd source aspects apparently are incompatible with Android Auto, which means Waze has little advantage over Google Maps."
"This was my favorite app in the past but since I am using Android auto this is a big no go. Draining the battery like crazy, phone gets super hot. App is laggy as hell. No speed cameras on the map like you have on your mobile. Audio often fails as well."
It's pretty laggy but I don't have an Apple so I can't use Apple maps which is superior and I hate Google maps
Would be fantastic but freezes on Android. When it's working I find it amazing but just now and again on it stops where it is and doesn't catch up. Sort it out and it's 5 stars from me.
Barely works anymore. Always freezes and I have to revert to Google maps near everytime.
"In many cases, has showed long route without any reason. Not a smart app at all."
Used to love this app but its getting glitchy. Alerts stay on the screen and no longer time out.
"This app constantly drives me in to stopped traffic, or construction, or has me making left hand turns across major streets with no traffic signals so I get to sit in traffic for an extra 10 minutes waiting for a break so I can make this left hand turn. I also love the re-routes that end up costing me time."
I love this app. It's adorable and I'm definitely going to keep using it. Y'all should give an option to put in construction. There's only options for cops and hazards and such like that. Also It would be super cool if y'all combine the weather into it.
"Live map doesn't ""sync"" anymore to what is edited on Waze Map Editor (Waze keeps routing me through a road blocked weeks ago due to construction and already set like that on Waze Map Editor)."
"Something has changed in the app. Without warning it will take you miles out of your way,it changes your whole trip with out any notice very annoying."
"I like the app, but it is difficult to select alternate routes at times. I ended up being taken the long way around rather than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge with no explanation. I would also like to put in a request for more celebrity voices. Patrick Stewart for one, James Earl Jones for another, and bring back Morgan Freeman please. Richard Dean Anderson and Sean Connery would be good too."
Keeps sending to wrong address and sometimes changes destination in middle of driving to destination. Several addresses incorrect. Been using for years just tired of it costing me valuable time. Don't recommend use another GPS.
"The arrival minutes to the location display is so small you can barely see it, but the time clock is 5x bigger?! I have a watch on my car, my hand my phone, didn't download this app for time telling purposes... Also the routes are not the best option available anymore"
I can't even go to a well known address in another state. I have to use a other GPS which finds multiple routes to the address. But somehow waze can't find a route.....I call bs. It's become so useless to me I don't even use it anymore. So sad bc I used to use it all the time.
Not sure what happened but lately I can't hear the navigation instructions from the speaker. It's like it's using the normal call speaker and not the speakerphone speaker. Volume is all the way up but can't hear anything anymore
Love Waze. A couple of suggestions. A round trip option would be great. Also for advance notice--option to select which specific lane (s) closures due to crash/construction..etc would be awesome
No address bar to start navigation. Immediately failed at being a maps app.
It's great actuate times 90% of the time the other 10% is only at most a few mins unless major traffic ot accidents occur dyeing route. But its the best making service I have ever used amazing when on the road and highly recommended to be used by everyone
"installed yesterday & used today. first impressions - excellent app. gave clear & repeated instruction, warnings for speed cameras & other hazards. I'm old school map & pre-planning but this app. may have just converted me. look forward to exploring this app further & it's settings. so far 10/10"
"My Android S20 stopped loading waze about 3 weeks ago ... I just get the ""just a sec"" spinning wheel of death ... Google maps works, but I hate it ... NEED TO FIX THIS ASAP. Multiple people have reported this to the website, developers have responded they are looking into it ... but still freezes"
"Extremely slow Extremely inaccurate Can never show my actual location Takes me on longer routes and adds to my travel time by 10 minutes when there is an obvious shorter route. When shorter eoute redirects, it tells me to make a U turn"
"Is there something wrong with speed camra notification, once apear and it's still on dashboard, also affect others notification as police reported doesn't work while speed camra still on screen."
Will not keep location current unless my phone screen is on. Don't have this issue with any other apps. Very annoying
"This is a excellent app. It tells you police, red light camera interections, traffic problems. So helpful. Also shows fellow wazzers around you."
Had to reinstall and now it's not letting me set my home or work addresses and it's not bringing up regular clients addressed as if they don't exist and they do in fact do. Please help I don't want to use Google maps if I don't have to!
"Add the ability to remove the my car, search bar and my waze button. Not needed and take up half the screen."
'No GPS- showing no approximate location' ..waze have this problem for the past 2 weeks thus making difficult to find direction. What is the problem and what the remedy.
Simply doesn't work any more - it freezes during every trip as if the GPS signal is suddenly unavailable. I then open Google maps instead and navigation works fine.
"Really needs a way to pause a trip. Had to stop for gas and now this stupid app wont calculate the route again. Just add a pause trip feature, have it keep the current path, then when I leave freeway just make a new path back to the old path."
It is a fantastic Navigation system! I'm going to use it instead of the system that came with my vehicle.
I dont know what is the reason for the UI & UX changes but it cause a really Bad experience after version update... You can't choose the best time arrivel and it is hard to use the App.. Good luck
"GTFO! This app for some surreal reason decides it wants to travel in the opposite direction. For no apparent reason. Addi g a half an hour to tour travel ti.e because you're stuck in a toll way!!! It does this more than it should!!! How about for NO F%#N REASON it just switches off your travel route. For no reason!!! It's buggy AF, FIX IT! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨üëäüëäüëäü§õü§õü§õüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñï"
"Interface changed for the worse; can no longer easily change my arrival time or see traffic along my route. not sure why it was changed in the first place, it doesn't look or function better"
Asking about ride share is painfully annoying and inconvenient with it's pop-up that cannot be disabled. Huge pop up ads are also annoying. While driving no one on this car wants to keep closing them.
Love the app but what have you done to the Australian voice I use. Now it's mixed with another one..I don't like it.
"I hate this app because it exists. I hate Google for buying it, and I hate them for making me use it. This is the only way to access the only accurate directions on EARTH if you don't want a female voice. So the options are this garbage app that sucks control of your device, or listen to your great aunt Eunice give you snipey directions for the rest of your life. Those are not choices. Go ahead and download it, you're almost certainly here because something is making you. Google blows."
"My go to nav app. I would give 5 stars but I have one problem with the navigation. I wish we could change the nav to say ""go 100 miles"" instead of drive for 1 hour and 30 minutes"" other than that I love Waze."
"This app has been recommended to me by two people as better and simpler than Google maps but, once installed, goes no further. Stuck on load screen once app is opened. Will change review if successful assistance recieved."
"Not sure which update ruined app but for a month I have location issue. Current Location gets stuck on one place and updates after minute or so then works fine for 30 sec and then stuck again. It's not a phone issue, I got same issue on 2 different devices."
"It used to work just fine, but now it's constantly stuck on the ""Just a second"" screen. Have tried reinstalling, clearing cashe, and restarting my phone. Nothing works. Literally cannot use this app now."
"I love using this app, however I have recently undergone issues. It continuously has a loading icon that says ""just a sec"", and it doesn't go beyond that. I can't use the app. Please fix this issue. I love this app buy Its not working."
"ü•∞LOVE this app, couldn't live without it. I use it religiously to keep me safe from police & road/traffic conditions. Thank god you guys fixed that ""just a sec"" issue. I appreciate ya'll working so hard & quick to fix it. Just feels like I NEED my waze app on at all times when I drive. I really appreciate the Waze app guys, thanks!!"
"Bad experience, not able to determine Kuala Lumpur roads well, always give a long way even though a simple turn will get into the intended road"
"Many map errors. When you report the errors, they don't get fixed and are rude!"
Looses gps signal constantly. Every few seconds it looses gps signal. And when it does it thinks I'm stopped so it shows those annoying ads. No it's not my phone because Google maps works perfectly. This needs to be fix asap.
"Awesome app use it all the time in my travels The best , When there's Alot of traffic ahead this app re routes you to your destination"
The most idiot gps system to give wrong route and make a 50km big turn then go back same location for many times. How much money I get from kesas highway to lead me into Sri petaling then go to puchong then go back to mex highway again? Really stupid even reported wrong route few times!
Needs work. When I'm on a call 2ith Android Auto the map will go black after finishing the call. Only way to fix this is to unplug USB. When I look up an address I came zoom in/out to see the surrounding area
Used the app for 3 yrs without problems. Lately it hangs within a few minutes after starting off. Uninstalled and re-installed the app but with the same results
"It's been a great app since I've started using it. I 've saved time in several occasions. But I still wonder if it is possible for the app to show, in some manner the not-paved ways, not many people have an all-terrain vehicle. Thanks."
"Very Good for updates and keeping you informed on Road info and road Reports from other Drivers is very Helpful To, Navigation Has been Fine with me on my journey when on my Travels keep on (Trucking ) for Me ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åøüëç"
"Good app for travelling showing you the distance, traffic etc. The only downside is that there is no offline option and if you run out of data the app is down."
Hi team the waze app in Australia still has major lagging issues. I've sent debug information etc. Is this being looked at all?
"I downloaded this after having issues with Google maps and dealing with a minor traffic jam. It took me on an absurdly slower and more difficult way after getting past the traffic jam! Then five minutes after I arrived late and got inside for my meeting it loudly announced, ""You have arrived at your destination!"". What the heck WAZE!!!! üò°üò°üò°üò°. UNINSTALLED!"
"It would be a better app if you could actually look up a route, as in put a different Start and Finish point other than your actual current location. I was trying to look up traffic for a friend and couldn't do it on Waze because it forced me to start a search from my location. A feature that Google Maps has had forever and that's very useful. Please add it."
"I love it but it's garbage! The app is great, saves me time, fuel, money, and makes my drives easier and safer. However, for the last two months or so, it's been buggy, slow, and really unstable with frequent crashes, even in the middle of driving, leaving me in very difficult situations. Restarting the app or the phone don't always help, I've even reset my phone completely, to no avail. Really frustrating, I hope this improves or I'll have to find another app."
Been using this for a while but now the speed camera alert comes on and doesn't clear. Fix it Waze!!!
"I used waze for a while, and it was ok, but recently the app just freezes during driving. For example it's time to turn or change the lane, but the app is frozen, and it shows 2 km until the turn. These are very serious issues, you can make a mistake and delay your arrival due to such issues. Very disappointing."
"Almost perfect. The live updates and maps are great. There is however one major problem I've experienced several times - it informs you of turns very far ahead and then just immediately when the turn comes. If you're doing highway speeds, focused on traffic, not looking at the map, it can lead to situations when you can't take the turn at all or are forced to react fast, creating a possibly dangerous situation. Especially when the turn is unplanned in the trip and put there to avoid an obstacle."
Loading the route to location takes forever. Cant connect to mobile data even when signal is fairly strong.
My address is still incorrect on the map. I've reported it to support many times. I live in a townhouse community which has three tiers and instead of taking you to the property it takes you past the address and into the neighborhood on a wild ride . Please fix it.
"Love the app, but lots of black screens, freezing, inability to use GPS and shows a message despite my location being turned on. Usually app stability is not an issue."
"Waze is disgusting, in the way that it preference location's towards who ever pays most. This results in you quickly choosing the first location of a certain franchise, only at 24km and further, for instance, while there is a closer location at 14km. This is disgusting business practice, as it amount to thousands of extra km's unnecessarily driven by thousands of motorists, as well as thousands of extra pollutants that we as a society are trying to combat. Disgusting business practice waze!"
"Love this app. Definitely helps me while driving and I'm happy to assist other drivers when there are issues on the roads. Even though I know it's in realtime, I wish I knew when the timelines were with some of the reporting."
"Last update broke it. If you search for a second drive, it enters a loop between overview and route. Also, lately, it keeps pushing me through routes that are significantly longer time."
"With the latest version, waze does not work properly with android auto. The position of the car through waze android auto is not updated immediatley but eevery 3-5mn. It is not useful for the driver."
The speedometer keeps saying I am 10-20mph faster than I actually am. I am using the latest version .
Very good navigation keep me updated on policies and short cuts to my destinations. Great app. For new Comer to an area that needs to get around the city or the suburbs.
Not able to find routes is not acceptable especially when I can type the same address in google maps and it gives a route please fix this
What's up with the voice? Jane starts talking normally then switches to a demon voice 7 octaves deeper. Almost crashed yesterday laughing at how creepy it sounds. Please fix.
Does not take you around traffic. This app puts you right in traffic. Worst GPS I've ever used!!
"We have used waze for years when we travel for highway info and to keep up with arrival times. If l could make one suggestion, it would be to add a pause button to momentarily stop the trip when we leave the highway for breaks. We laugh about ""tearing up her nerves"" when we pull off the highway"
"The app is ridiculous. I'm trying to use it to go home and it's telling me it can't find a location. I updated my phone,Uninstall and reinstall it,clear the data and cache and it's samething. Smh"
"At times got stuck, and confused But still carrying on with Waze for the nice voice prompts and alerts."
"After the last update in the past days the app became useless, since it cannot connect to the GPS"
Long time user of Waze. However lately the ads have stayed put in the screen while driving. Super annoying and distracting especially as a safety issue.
I would like to see transit and walking options added to the choices in the app.
I love it but.. If it has a bug don't expect it to be fixed quickly. The voice issue has been ongoing despite all of the updates. It's getting really annoying now.. Is this so difficult to fix???
"Excellent app,. We've used it in a few countries and it's far superior to Google maps or even my Garmin"
Still has it installed but i can't view the actual route of my trip...Turn by turn. If i can find it ill change the review.
"Its working good when i used it to cp but when i connect the waze to android auto, may location is not moving. Why? I want to use waze in my car"
"I too am having the same issue with Android Auto. Since the latest update, Waze freezes. I have tried to clear cache, restart phone and look for forums to no avail. Is there an update or something that can be done to fix this issue?"
"Very helpful but if we can see logo patrol stations on our ways , it will be much better. Thank you."
"App works great if I do the opposite. I use Waze all day, every day. It has been worse the past 4 months. Example. It tells me to take NJ Garden State Parkway south local lanes. Which always has miles of shore traffic. I use express and bypass MILES of slow traffic."
"I have been using waze for a long time now and the only thing that see is the difference is that. Google Maps has a compass and tells you if you are going North, South, East or West. Waze does not have a compass on it. I am hoping that waze will have a compass on it someday."
"2 voices are overlapping, super confusing and distracting when driving."
I finally figured out what was wrong with my phone. Somehow this app was conflicting with my phone causing it to constantly shut off and restart itself. I don't have that problem anymore since I deleted the app. I guess I won't be using this anymore
"Superb, get actual speed & speed limit shown - essential in Edinburgh as they hide 30mph limits behind traffic lights! Latest update when on android auto cannot read time. wrong font colour for dark mode on android auto. Still essential app"
"Outstanding üëçüëç it's not just a map app, it's a open community that helps each other! I support this!"
Sometimes the roads on the map becomes invisible random. This just started happening. Sound/voice setting is buried within the app. Needs to be easily visible
"Overall pretty decent app, but occasionally takes you unnecessarily small and out of the way roads in an attempt to save a minute or two. But as everyone else is taking the ""short cut"" it often ends up taking longer. Additionally it isn't ideal to b forced down an unfamiliar, unlit farm road at night in an attempt to save seconds..."
"I have been using waze for years but recently It has become unreliable and full of bugs, midway during a journey it will change route and take me a much longer way but when I refresh it will come back to the original route."
Love the app! But I would hope to see a commercial vehicle feature in the future as they aren't allowed through certain parts i.e - height / width restrictions and royal parks
"Best navigation app EVER!!! Love all the things you can report and see when others report issue, traffic or police."
"Like malware, Waze hijacks volume without permission and lowers your music playing, even when connected to the car speakers to function as a radio, while Waze speaks on the phone like a traditional GPS device. Maddening and toxic."
I Love this app. I use it everyday even when traveling a short distance. I need to know where the police are at all times!
"Runs ads at stop lights, yes I'm stopped but it's still very distracting. Terrible idea to distract someone on the road even if they're stopped! Oh well back to their main competitor that doesn't do this."
"NEEDS option to select which alerts you want to hear. Sorry, but im not gonna have my music interrupted every 2 minutes because people feel the need to list every abandoned car on the shoulder of the freeway"
"Waze is the best GPS in finding/searching location of all drivers/public users. Easy 2find the shortest routes 2ur requirement location, even if u change ur routes 2, they will brought back the shortest/fastest, also avoid roads works/jams areas/traffic police(under speeding act) & obstruction objects(under driving act). But most time gets funny street names such as ...drive call as ...doctor, jurong...call as ju-long,..etc etc, it's very funny!"
"Now it works again :) Great app. The only missing star for the routes quality, the time arrival calculation and for allowing adding only one stop to the trip. Killer feature: speed cameras!!"
"Love the app but bugs appearing, since the last update the speed camera warning remains on the screen blocking notifications for any real hazards"
Speed camera messages stay on screen and you have to manually removed them after passing the camera Also why don't school zones show up and why are speed alerts not customisable
App was great but lately it's been freezing alot. I can sometimes travel 50-60km before it comes back online then it works briefly and freezes again. Using it with Android auto.
"Waze, why don't you want to take me on the highway? Offers me other routes besides the highway in Switzerland while Google maps takes me to the highway and saves me half the time. And where are the cameras?"
"I've been using Waze for years & I loved the app and would have definately given 5 stars up until 4 weeks ago when the app just stopped working. All I get is the spinning wheel & words ""just a sec"". It won't load anymore. I've deleted, uninstalled & reinstalled the app so many times but still the same problem. I can't even get it working enough to log an issue. This was my go to app for navigation/traffic/police, everything. Hubby and I have the same google phone, works on his, not mine."
Something problems with this Need to add some points with the cameras like need to add camera should be show in the different colour and it should be informe with the voice Need to Add offline navigation system
"In android phone, most of the time, it gives the long route instead of an obvious shorter one. Traffic updates aren't really that much updated."
cant find any of my friends. share my location and my map is always backwards or upside down so i hv to pay very close attention to wich way the arrow in the left corner is pounting. would go back to google apps if it wasnt for all there glitches. the direction ahead of u should b up not down.whateber i like the lil diff mood imojis amd alerts for cops n traffic are accurate. adds pop up in my way slso
"On the app, the mode of transporation is shown about 1/8 of a mile on the road behind where car actually is."
"I'm in Saudi Arabia and don't know Arabic language, but in map all street name and all information written by Arabic language. Now how to force app to convert everything in English?"
"Three years ago I posted a negative review, because of all the problems with this app. I gave it another try three months ago and am delighted to say Waze has improved dramatically, to the point where it is now my ""go to"" app for navigation."
"Sh*ttest app ever. Can't find where I am, can't find the adress lot of times, show no end routes, don't know, if streets are off... Should I count any longer? Those are really big problems, if I am on a hurry. Its a mistake to download it."
Used to work well. Lately it has been routing me on the longest route. The other day it took me to a field instead of the Starbucks I was looking for. Had to use Google maps to get me there. My wife and I have a joke. It seems that the longer routes always seem to take us by their advertisers. Lol
Why can't I see the route options for both with and without toll at the same time like it used to. And why can't I search for gas station from my vehicle screen anymore?! Come Waze you can do much better than this. Been using it for over 6 years...
"This app is very useful to my Dad's work. But recently, it always crashed. We can't open it. So how do you fix it, waze? It's really annoying and it become useless. I hope you can resolve this issue as soon as possible."
"First released in 2006, so 12 years of evolution looks like didn't lead to something significant. Ux and routing thats pain. Pinch in/out, restoring from same view where you left, unpossibility to switch back to phone when connected via android auto and many many others. Unfortunately had to use it, because don't see alternative with same community and road cards updates. That is what happens when there is no local strong competitor. This app is a full bunch of compromises."
I love using waze I have no problems finding my location and it avoids all toll roads witch it amazing and show you where all traffic hazards are witch I like that alot
"Works when maps doesn't. I dont like the robot voice, I haven't looked to see if I can up date it yet."
"Feature Removed: The latest version no longer lets me calculate the ETA in advance. E.g.: I want to arrive somewhere by 6 p.m.. Before the update, I could see when I need to leave my location so that I arrive at my desired time. If the feature hasn't been removed but rather its been moved, please let me know how to access that feature"
It's just the best app for when you're a newbie and just got your drivers licence. I like how they give you the opportunity to create your own voice that guides you. Very helpful.
Waze works great! Would be 5 stars if it listed exit numbers on the map.
"Screen keeps turning doesn't show police when they are actually there, no live traffic at all garbage app please fix it"
Since version 4.82.5.1. The map will stop moving in split screen. Have to keep waze in foreground to keep map moving. Have to stay on old version and stop auto update.
I have enjoyed using the Waze app for traffic and traveling. Very up-to-date and very informative little app. Very easy to use and seems to be very exact.
"This app is very helpful. It saves time, its alerts are accurate. Thanks for Waze."
Works great. So far hasn't taken me on private property. Once I set up auto can you remove blue icon on screen. Also I would like top tier as a gas selection as well as Costco.
"Love the app overall, I'd just like it to have a paid version without ads I could buy."
I've been using this app for the past 5year till I robbed my phone 3weeks ago ever since been trying to download it I've experienced the worst NO GPS NO Location approximate all sorts of nonsense even deleted it
"The best navigating app I have ever used. When approaching destination, it does not indicate ""destination will be onbthe left or right"". It would be nice if they can work on this."
I love this Waze app and working well on my Andriod Auto Haval H6 however I love to be able to see the Waze in full screen. Thanks
App works great. I like knowing what is on the road ahead and being able to update other drivers.
It wasn't working properly at all in fact it was upside down on my phone and weird so I uninstalled it and reinstalled it just don't trust it
Please add search function in settings. They are not intuitively ordered.
"Hello team, Great app so happy with it. But only recently i started experiencing delays on waze directions or what is the next turn to make. The app doesnt seem to have an update, please advise on the issue if possible. Thank you"
"Sydney user here. What a bloody disgrace. Today, I went from Narwee to Hillsdale. Waze directed me to go on the M5 at King Georges Rd, Beverly Hills. I didn't know it was a toll road until I was already in the far right lane for the on-ramp. My setting was and ALWAYS is 'Avoid Toll Roads', yet Waze forced me onto a toll road and it also gave me no other route options. Is Waze getting some kickbacks from directing all Eastbound traffic onto the M5? I have been using Waze 10+ years!!!"
Best navigation app there is! I love this app. Way more up to date than google maps and more accurate route with drive time. If you haven't made the switch I recommend doing so!
Arrival times are way off and it doesn't adjust for time zones. According to waze 440 miles take 5 hours to drive. You'd have to maintain 88 mph to do that. Speed limit is 60-70mph. Horrible app
"Last update caused road hazards, police reports or anything to automatically NOT disappear only while using Android auto."
"When experimenting on a highway, I was not alerted of any radar, knowing that I activated all alerts. and I was connected to the Internet"
"I used to love this app for my route but lately, it has sent me in the wrong direction or a similar street name but the address number isnt even near the number cluster. Its getting annoying and I lose time on my routes."
Too glitchy right now. I depend on Waze for accurate directions and lately it stays frozen rendering thia app useless. Please fix!! Going back to Google Maps until the problem is taken care of.
"What has happened to this app, it used to be so good. It's got sluggish, giving directions late etc. That however is nothing compared with what's just happened! While driving the map suddenly dissapears and is replaced with a full screen message wittering on about terms of service! Really waze? Have you never heard the saying ""there's a time and place"". If that's the level of thoughtlessness to expect, I'll be finding an alternative to waze."
"I have used this app for several years. Ohave traveled across the country and taken many multi-state trips. In addition to directions, I use it to find gas stations and restaurants along the way."
"Have an issue on no GPS or connection when it launched. It takes several minutes and really make my day down for a few moments. Hope that this problem can be solve immediately, because I really do love using this apps every time I needed."
Like it but some of the map junctions are not quite clear enough when roads are running close to the road you are on..
Used to love this app. Take me to the houses I'm looking for. But now it takes me to the compleat wrong house. Not great in the dark. Hope it's fixed soon
"The hands free ""OK waze"" voice search used to be incredible and then I think about 2 years ago Google replaced it with a Google voice search. This new search likes to give you dictionary definitions of the words in the address you're frantically shouting while in traffic."
GPS stop working doesn't know exactly where I am. Tried recommended step to fix still an issue.
Used for its voice packs. But it crashes every journey and does not support the upload of mp3 files anymore (it worked previously on rooted phones).
To this day I can't understand why waze won't allow audio alerts for traffic jams. Sometimes they could make the difference between a near miss and a safe slowdown especially on curvy roads.
"Freezing and lagging on carplay(android auto) Started 2-3 months ago on samsung s10 and samsung s20 FE on Ford Focus Mk4 (sync 3.4) . Sometimes it works fine for a while, but it struggling to update screen with information."
"What happened to this app? It would be great if we could choose the route instead of Waze deciding for us. Had a horrific experience today. Rush hour and Waze kept switching my route. Once it switched my route only to make me U turn back to the previous route. At two points it showed TWO routes to follow on the screen simultaneously, confusing me. Had to switch off the app and turn it on again."
The last update made app to not show coordinates in real time. The position is showed with lags and because of this I can't use any more. Hopefully next update will resolve this. Other apps doesn't have this issue.
"I appreciate all the notifications. The directions are clear. This works great on my phone, better than the others."
"Perfect navigation, it'll never mislead you. Yes it takes you through longer routes most times but it'll definitely guide you to your destination. I recommend this app üíØ"
Use it daily... fantastic getting around traffic standstill!! And police presence alerts Nad road hazards!!
"Awesome! Update. I lowered the score to 4 stars only. For some reason, in the older version, I didn't see the QUIT option on the main home screen, I updated the app, the option showed up, worked well once, maybe twice, then couldn't quit from that menu, pressing the QUIT option. Quitting is almost hidden option. I'd prefer to see it well, to be visible."
"Waze was great ,the big problem is when you try and use it in the car as it has stopped working with android auto. All you get is a black screen."
What can't I download maps areas before I drive to save on data.. It is available on Google Maps
"Good app, could be great or perfect even ... but when your brain is doing calculations faster and better ... :( ... After a few years is better ... as it uses my average for new calculations, or so it seems. Waiting for lane position, when and where possible !"
"Best navigation. I would appreciate to add option of showing incoming change of speed limit directly on map before every village / speed limitation area, etc... This is really essential for me. Thanks!"
App is unusable on Android auto. The real time update of your current location freezes and I'm a few minutes will update to another stationary position. Tried all troubleshooting instructions to fix it.
Have been using Waze for years and have loved it till the last month or so. It doesn't move its like the screen is frozen. If this keeps up I'll uninstall and use another app. A shame as I've been a Waze lover for years
Anyway to move the highlighted route to the middle of the screen? It's like all the way to the right..
I have one complaint. Please make the speed limit indicator bigger. I can hardly read it.
Good alternative to Google Maps if you need a change of features. Lots of waze to interface with various en route alerts and road trip suggestions.
Always works great and I love that users can interact with each other and post speed traps!
"This app is unrealible it just stopped,l deleted and re installed it again but still won't open."
"Use it everyday while travelling for work via android auto but recently in the last week it's got a major bug where the map freezes whilst driving so you miss your turns etc, gone over to Google maps now instead with no problems."
Wake was fine now its so bad idk what happened but now I get sent to the wrong place and after selecting my location it doesn't start navigation keeps goin back to select route when I choose my route it won't navigate until I press it about 50 times fix it please
The constant detours/adverts that block the actual map you need to see are idiotic. It's also dangerous since you have to keep fiddling with the app while driving.
Best Satnav ever! Accurate routes and times including traffic and even when there are road works. 5 stars.
"Love it! Except one. I live close to an intersection, it always takes me to some smaller neighborhood's road then go back to the intersection instead of just going straight üôÉ"
"Jane voice started to act weird, there's a 2nd female voice partnering with her. Preferred all Jane. Please fix this"
"This app is dangerous and will get you lost. It will randomly decide not to verbalize directions to you, sometimes it's half the trip, sometimes it's all so riding a motorcycle I'm still having to constantly look at my phone, not safe"
It helps me commuting and also helps me get where I need to go and see my clients whilst at work. Can't fault it.
"Freezing, locking up and stuttering since this last update. You might be adding support for Android 12 but you are killing Android 11. What a waste. Nothing works at all now. Nothing..... Going back to GARMIN."
"Game changing for us motorcyclists. I just wish motorcyclists could turn off carpool buttons. Also, we're unable to edit out position icon when in motorcycle mode. 5 stars if these things are addressed."
I had to uninstall and reinstall the app. Trouble of logging into the smart lock and waiting the app to load. It was so frustrating. Hope it doesn't happen again.
This is an amazing app ever.i really never get lost with this app.just only if you Lost the signal it's then start the problems
"In the last few weeks, the app has become annoying. You go through an area with a fixed camera, and the waze notifies me of it.... but after the notification doesn't disappear for the next camera... it stays on till my destination....40 miles from the last camera... and as well the speed indicator keeps disappearing from the screen.... All above were things that made me choose waze over google maps...."
I love this app! Just to be honest it's way better than Google Maps. I'd recommend anyone downloading this
Something wrong with planning a drive in the future. The screen start to flash with a notice that the trip.is to long
"There is some bug recently, navigating through crazy longer routes, showing strange times and km. Doesn't work properly and should be very careful not to mislead you."
Its a good and I use it all the time. Although has issues on and off with Andriod auto. Tends to just stay frozen on the map. Fix that and you will have 5 stars.
"This app is horrible ,it gives me wrong directions and most importantly does not save the location of my vehicle"
Love the app. Heavily in need of a UI/UX change. It's been the same since 2015 smh
Waze is superior to Google maps by far. I have used Waze for directions with my work and it has yet to let me down. Not one mislead trip at all in the 3 years that I have used it. Great app!!!
Starts me off in the opposite direction 100% of the time. It's frustrating.
It was great took me right where I needed to go. Thank you muches. Hope you all have a great X Mas and a Happier New Years. Peace out.
Back on top after most recent update. Issues fixed. Thanks Waze üòä
"No good because it gives a long drive route üòîüòîüòî unlike before, very slow for searching location"
Thanks for your update and for fixing the issue .....I you're able to get the next update put more newer cars üöó. Marry Christmas
Re-center button and report button disappear after touching the screen at all.
Easy to use? counter intuitive - Visually? Abominable for professional use
Love this app works great and I am sure it has saved me a ticket or two over the years I have used it. I primarily use it with android auto and prefer it over Google maps and the built-in nav.
Lost speedometer even Im with android 7 and last update was november. I use not android auto.
Since the last update Waze stopped showing the activate device location window when location services are off.
Latest bug release to fix multiple voices during drive didn't work
The route keeps refreshing like there no link and it cant log into it Like it froze or messed up
"Even with the newest update with android auto, Jane still has a creepy voice."
The latest update did nothing to address the faulty Jane voice.
Works great in Android Auto. Also support is good.
Lost GPS in tunnels. Unlike Google maps that continues to work
App is routing me away from expressways even after adding my autosweep and easytrip passes.
"I have been a faithful user however now I'm getting an error on planning my drives. I have uninstalled and signed out. What should I do to fix this, delete my account maybe?? Help please ü•∫"
Everything seems fixed since the latest update. Good job.
"Very helpful app on the road, you'll never gonna get lost."
Good nav app for traffic but does take me on roads I'm not familiar to which makes things stressful
"Is very helpful while driving. However, seems worse today than 6 years ago. ü§∑"
"Support via the market works amazing. Now, it is back as my main app for roads"
Best ever application for navigation i have ever seen!!!!
"Is there a way we can make this app overlayed and minimized like google maps? This would be very helpful if it does, so we can navigate while doing other stuff at the same time on our mobile phones. Thanks!"
Lately the app is having issues finding routes and frequently states no network connection.
"GPS either cannot be found or disconnects almost every use. I also have an iPhone so I imagine it's an Android issue. Either way, cannot use app!"
"A great app, just wish I could select.that I have a 10m trailer behind my car but otherwise perfect and highly.recomended"
"Android auto waze freezes randomly on the drive, gmaps doesn't do this, pls fix!"
I keep entering my date of birth and selecting ok but the app freezes and can't do anything. I've uninstalled
"Very good and useful, thanks and keep the great work."
This was my preferred guidance app. Since the last update it will not locate GPS at all and is useless
Quickest detours and road notifications is what I like the most. Though if look for gas or food along my route it shows me places not closer than 100km away. I cannot refine search!! Funny it is
"If you like routes that takes you into totally avoidable standstill traffic and show it to you only when you stuck, this app is for you. If you want to know what's ahead, use google maps instead."
"I love waze. However, it is annoying when I am on the phone waze freezes up and stops updating causing me to miss exits. Is there a setting that I can change to avoid these issues?"
"Told it is good for roadworks. Downloaded on tablet. Wants my date of birth (why? ), tried to enter my birth date, would not accept. Unable to use."
"A great app. I'm happy I'm in a big city where a lot of people contribute what they see on the roads, it makes it very accurate in real time."
Seems like Waze gives instructions to go through busy roads when there are a number of faster and alternative roads even though they take longer distance. Please improve on this.
"Offline maps The app needs an option to download offline maps, as app doesn't work in areas without network connection."
Doesn't show all speed cams. Also no option to add them. Got recommended an alternative route that would save me 4 minutes; it made my trip about 25 minutes longer.
"Roads, streets ect. are easy to read and to figure out your travel"
What have you done to the app? I select an address from the list and it totally disappears like I never entered it. It's freezing and constantly saying not connected.
"Requires gps for app to open, idk if this is a bug or by design but it is no longer useful as a Maps replacement"
App is no longer reliable or usable. ads pop up and block the map. Directions refuse to load. Tried reporting problems but process is too much work. Rip waze
Waze is now horrible...it no longer automatically redirect you around traffic like it use to . You will sit in traffic until you press the button to take an alternative right. It works like Google now. Just terrible.
Though I really like this app and use it alot it's loosing a couple of stars for its cap on reporting. The app actively encourages you to report traffic issues but blocks you should you report to many. This left me sat in heavy traffic unreported by others and not being able to report it myself. This after making 3 genuine reports. This actively stops you supporting other Waze users.
"Good app but it tries to take you off the HWYs . I think the programmers are mostly car hating pajama boy millennials and they purposely try to take you through very dark , isolated highways at night, especially through rural places like Tennessee. I think they want to make the rural folks experience more traffic to dampen their Tranquillity and rural living experience. It'll also take you through random neighborhoods. Barely saving up seconds."
Please fix the RANDOM QUITTING while screen is off... its causing accidents.
helps great but I need short cut please..short cuts....short cuts....short cuts...thank you in advance especially delivery riders like me to get more bookings...
So whose bright idea was this..I used to use waze for android auto and boom all of sudden waze disappears and now am forced to use maps. When I asked assistant to open waze on the dashboard it says it's no longer supported ..what a bummer
"App become my everyday friend in the trips. Really good. But! In the car I can't zoom map normally. Sometimes map show from very far, I zoom-in but after few mins map zoom-out automaticly."
Very cool. Had me hooked on maps after the first trip. Like to hear me tell me where to turn. Lol
Using Andoid Auto on a 2020 Corvette Waze only displays a black screen. Audio guidance functions normally.
"Can't sign in! Absolute rubbish, app continually freezes and crashes"
With this app you get accurate directions as well as having fun in the car with children with voice effects
Well GMaps finally squit the bed last week so here I am reading revs about how Waze is suddenly failing too.
"It's impossible to grab the position of the smartphone or the car, in the auto drive."
Latest update is not good. One touch navigation is gone. Add a stop often doesn't work. Waze: fix the 2nd problem & make the first at least an option.
When I start using last 3 years it's easy get reach the place without any confusion.. But now days the road that is close shows a lot far. Very lazy to use Waze. But Google map shows the road that is far even close
"After I close (lock) the screen, Waze closes itself within 2 minutes... I have no app manager that could close it like that or any power saving and I also have Waze ""locked"" in order to not get closed but it still happens.. Very disappointing since it consumes a lot of power with the screen on!! 2 - alternate routes is broken!!! I'm getting a single suggestion!! How is this possible?!?! üò°"
Very pleased with this free navigation aid. Arrival times are very accurate and notifications of map issues prompt. The problems with map locking up has been resolved.
Simple. Fun. Better then Google maps. Lots of options to use with waze
"The app works, just not with Android Auto in my car. App has all the permissions it needs, even for GPS even when the app isn't running, but it won't track at all when connected to Android Auto. Disconnect from AA, and it's fine and will even run and give directions when the phone is locked."
"Sometimes takes me to the wrong place. Always advertising to me while I drive with 1/2 screen ads. Guess they don't care if I die reading an unimportant ad. Used to be great, then Google bought to them."
"Update 2: Multiple users are reporting issues with using Waze with Android Auto. Its unusable. Developers refuse to admit there is an Android Auto problem. My advice, if you have to use Android Auto, don't use Waze, find another app."
"Unusable now. Approach roundabouts says half of the message , by the time you're in it, it might relay the rest of the message, it might not. Doesn't happen with other driving apps , so clearly issue with Waze"
No longer avoids highways. Same with Google maps who also owns waze. I prefer back roads.
Sometimes the app freezes while in use and might start back up a mile down the road and also speedometer sometimes dissappear which is another annoying thing. Can this be sorted
"I think the Waze app is great, except when the syncing of iheart radio stopped working. I really liked this feature if it can be fixed."
The constant freezing over the last couple of months has been terrible. Just updated and unbelievably its still happening. What a fall from grace.
Can't even login or make an account. Email verification has sent three links I've clicked all three and it brings me back to the app just to say no connection. Great app.
I love this app and I use it all the time... but I cannot longer use it in android auto üòí. This is a huge setback
"Seemed like a children's game at first, but I'm used to it now and really like it. I like the displaying, reporting & confirming of things like roadworks and accidents. Re-routing is instant. No time is wasted continuously telling me to do a U turn like other apps. Search function could be better. The display is easy on the eye and accurate. The obtrusive Car Info button isn't important, so should be built into the task bar below."
"The app is missing features. I would love to see a feature where you can set an amount of time which would represent the time saved before using toll roads. Example: I set mine to 15. If taking a toll road would save me more than 15 minutes, the use toll. Right now I am checking the time to my destination, the I turn off ""avoid tolls"" and I check again. It's pretty annoying."
"I'm a huge fan of Waze, which is why it pains me to give it 3 stars. The functionality, mapping, planning, and ability to share what is happening on the roads in real time is brilliant. But the app is horrendously unstable. On a 5 hour journey the app crashed in excess of 8 times. On a shorter journey it froze within 5 minutes of launching, which this occurring repeatedly until the app cache and storage was wiped and started afresh. It needs to be sorted out."
"I really love this app, but there are a few MAJOR flaws. When a road is closed, and I'm trying to submit a report to the app, more often than not the particular roadI want to mark as closed is unable to be marked as closed. I should be able to tap on any road in the area but the appropriate arrows aren't available on certain roads. The other major problem is the ads. They're supposed to only pop up when the car is stopped, which is bad enough, but recently an ad popped up while I was in a tunnel because the GPS was indicating that I want moving. This is DANGEROUS in a mapping app. Please remove ads entirely. Another problem, less critical but still bad, is sometimes it tells me a certain destination is in a tunnel, when any human can tell you there will never be a destination in the tunnel. The destination is actually on a different road on the surface. It should be easy to program the app to not make this error."
"An alternative to Google Maps that works just as well. I like that speed cameras are on it. It is underused in the rural area that I live in so live traffic updates are not good. The big downside is that it only intermittently syncs with my calendar, so it is completely useless when I need to navigate somewhere without knowing the address off the top of my head. For that Google Maps is far better."
"A recent Google maps update basically broke itself, so I was temporarily forced to use another navigation app, which lead me here. The app is very polished, very fun to use, with speed limit display, traffic and closures, etc etc. But it has one fatal flaw. It likes to take you to the wrong street. A lot. Even with the finish flag on top the road you want to end up on, if there's a parallel road nearby, it'll just take you there instead. Makes the app mostly pointless. Please fix!"
"It's a lovely app and is perfect for me. It automatically sets my routes figuring out the best one for me to take avoiding the busiest. Updated 29.09.2018. I have been using this app for just under a year and for the majority of that time it has been absolutely fantastic. Unfortunately, over the last few months it loses it satellite reception, usually at important times in the journey like junctions or turns. I don't know why it has begun to fail like this but it's very frustrating and annoying!"
"I tried it out as an alternative to Google maps on Android Auto. A few major problems. First, no Australian voice pack. Great option to record your own voice! Great in theory, but it didn't work on my car üòï The voice did play, to be fair, but really really quietly so that it could not be heard over the radio. no Bueno. Then it advised of a speed monitored zone FULL BLAST and in an English accent (speech synthesis). again, great, but not what i wanted. why not let me record my voice?"
"I installed it, set up everything, then I put in an address and then it crashed. Now it instantly crashes everytime I open it, as soon as I opened it. Voice recognition does not work, it couldn't even find my home. I checked if it was an issue with my GPS or signal but nope, google maps worked perfectly fine. Was looking for an app to better my experience with deliveries... this is certainly not an app I would recommend let alone be able to use because of its constant crashing."
Good features but requires a lot of physical interaction while driving. I mainly use the features to help others as a passenger. The search function of the navigation leaves a lot too be desired. I can give an exact street address but it cannot get me there. I end up going back to Google of I am in a hurry. It will give a list of streets near the address but not exact. Some are kilometres away. If this could be improved I will happily increase my rating.
"I like to use Waze as I find it helps me to get a better idea of how long my trip will take. This is not always that accurate though, so I tend to give myself a 10-15 minute buffer. I'm getting annoyed with the planned trips function though. I struggle to get the more options to open rather than selecting the the trip and activating it. Sometimes I want to edit the arrival time but find it so frustrating."
"I have used Waze for over 8 years covering around 70,000 miles. It was very reliable and I loved the traffic info and the fact that users could add alerts to help others. But I have tried to use it in the last week for a couple of journeys and found it totally unusable. It is constantly recalculating the route. It is zooming in and out all the time which is a major distraction. When stationary, the map spins around and around. On the move when there are no junctions it appears to work for a few minutes then it will jump to another road that I am not on, then jump back to the road I am actually on. When approaching an intersection or roundabout, it will give you a count down in feet, except the count goes up as well; 675 feet, 479 feet, 600 feet, 350 feet, etc. I don't know what you have done to break it but version 4.76.5.0 is totally unusable, bordering on the dangerous."
"Highly overrated. It's indeed good in warning the driver about incidents, but the navigation is horrible. In my opinion, the driver can still look outside the car and see what's going on so the warnings are a nice-to-have. The primary purpose of a navigation app is NAVIGATING, and it is horrible in that aspect. Can't download maps, sent me around in a circle a couple of times, takes weird routes which take longer than the normal route. So yea, not so great..."
"Great app to get you to your destination with feedback on road conditions from other users which is fantastic. I would prefer if it showed map overview like Google maps when making the route so I can instantly see if I the chosen route is to my liking and if I definitely chose the right place to go to. Also if you don't have the address to a place you want to go to, it's sometimes hard to find them here, and I have to check it on maps first."
"I'm having the same problems many others mention, following recent updates. The app will lose where you are and which way you are driving, even when the phone has a GPS signal. It is unable to extrapolate which way you are heading when the GPS signal is lost (an issue when you live in a mountainous region with lots of tunnels!). The arrow will face the wrong way, then become a spot, then the map rotates so north is at the top, usually meaning you cant's see your route properly any more. It's basically unusable - please fix it so it works like it used to!"
Traffic updates are not shown. No updates on construction sites. The main purpose is defeated when you can't figure out how much time will it take to ride till you reach your destination. That's the main drawback. Visual graphics and options are awesome. Easily got addicted to it. However later I had to switch on to Google maps for better traffic updates.
"Waze deteriorated during the last few months to the point that I went out shopping for another navigator. To illustrate it, it has been for over 2 hours as it's been happily calculating a route while I had to use the sun, the road signs, and to certain extent my car's 10-year old navigator to get to my destination point and back.... That's right! Today, I hated it with passion."
"Iffy. I have this installed on two phones. It works more smoothly on the iPhone than the Android phone. Often I find I can't even get a route at all. Today I can't plan an arrival time. It sometimes tries to save a minute over a tiny part of the journey by sending you via a route full of difficult junctions that actually takes longer, there should be a bit of intelligence applied to the threshold. Must useful for road closures!"
"By far the best GPS app I have ever used. The alerts feature for traffic, police accidents, etc are spot on and very accurate. only issue I have is turn-by-turn navigation on city streets could give a little more warning. Depending on where you are and your speed, turn-by-turn is a little slow in some places. Other than that this app is amazing. Also love the option of have spotify interact with Waze so I don't have to flip from screen to screen!"
"It's a good app, the only problem I have it's that it doesn't download voice with street names, Wich I had before I change it to listen the different voices they have available. I've tried to contact them but their instructions are useless. For now I'm stuck with Federico. Another problem is that if there's not a lot of people in your area the traffic it's not accurate all the time."
"I have recommended this application to everyone I know. It has some flaws but the pros outweigh the cons. One major con I've recently noticed is that I can no longer use the ""OK Waze"" voice command to enable Waze to listen to my commands whilst driving. I no longer report traffic incidents due to the removal of this function. I would have to touch the screen to turn on voice commands each time I want to give one now, which is illegal in Australia. The GPS speedometer function is great and having the ability to display the speed limit is also great. In heavy traffic, in unknown areas, sometimes speed limit signs are obscured from vision by vehicles or other objects, being able to confirm this by looking/listening to alerts alleviates some stress. The speed limits are not always up to date, particularly if the road is under construction. Re-routing directions based on delays/accidents in traffic is good, though, sometimes the full effects of a traffic incident is not known until it's too late and you're part of the slow traffic by that stage. The opposite can also be true - heavy traffic may be reported along your route but by the time you reach that section, it has already cleared up. If you make a mistake and need to make a U-turn, Waze doesn't specifically tell you to make a U-turn. The developers have done a great job - 5 stars if you bring back the voice commands."
"Overall, I like that Waze updates the traffic situation.  That's the major reason why I use it, although Google does provide the same features.  A few points , though.  1) I find that the estimated times are ALWAYS substantially less than actual.  On a normal one hour drive that sees added traffic, the estimate will be off by as much as 50%.  Surely with all the data available, including historical traffic and speed data, they can do better.  My old TomTom device would be the opposite, overestimating but at least close.  2) I detest the way that Waze selects routes.  Older devices allowed an option to ignore the local area.  Especially for repeated drives, everyone has their preferred local routes, and having Waze define the route as it chooses just makes it less useful. I'd like the app to allow me to ask for 'Most direct' route.  I don't want to zig zag all over the city, I want to go directly there  I know that I can edit the route to some extent, although that doesn't work on mobile very well, the system is awkward to use and faulty.  Perhaps the app could allow saving of specific ROUTES as well as locations, for those of us who merely want time and traffic information."
"Why is the panning/scrolling of the map such a hideous experience?! I have a OnePlus 5T and the whole map scrolling is so scattered, jammy and ultimately just annoying. Isn't there a way to give it some extra smoothness to the touch? I really like scrolling the map in all directions sometimes and I think it shouldn't be as painful as it is. Thanks. That's my only concern, everything else is as good as it gets."
"The app is great, and I really like to use it while commuting both in city and across country. However, there is one big and very annoying bug which I'm really looking forward to be fixed. When I chose alternative route, for example the blue one, and click go, I manage to notice that before opening big map it switches back to original route, which is awful. Only after second attempt I can switch to the route I want to drive. It has made me several times to drive the route I didn't want to("
"Much more informative than Google Maps - I'm enjoying using this app. Only criticisms would be that the last couple of times I've used it, the map has frozen and I've only become aware of it once I've started off, so therefore have had to find a safe place to pull over, stop the app and clear cache before continuing. Also I find it odd that you can't sample a Voice before selecting."
"This used to be my go-to app for navigation, until recently when it became unusable. Most of the time the app doesn't even open, or crashes when it does. Despite using the appropriate settings, it seems like it goes out of its way to take me to impossible intersections. One of the great things is its ability to estimate arrival time according to a specific departure time, which does wonders for planning ahead, but now I barely use it for that anymore since I can't open the app."
"App has a great potential and is much better option for drivers compared to Google Maps. However there are still a lot of issues occurring on daily usage. For example, it can start to miss alerts for unknown reason unless restarted; arrow on the map can become permanently rotated 90 degrees to your orientation. And there seems to be no option to report an incident outside of your current position. I really hope that developers will continue improving it."
"Whenever I search for directions by voice, it searches for places 'around you' despite the fact that the address is in a different area... this means that the search comes up with nothing and I have to pull over to manually input it. Super frustrating. Also, there is no way to block pop ups about fuel prices which is a feature I do not want and find really annoying."
"The app is constantly crashing mid travel. The only way to get it back is to go to apps, force quit, and then restart. This is NOT something you want to do whilst driving.  Also the insistency of the app to drive you into traffic jams without  (or when it is too late) informing you about it is annoying. Especially when there are options to avoid them.   A positive way to say this is: It would be nice if Waze could inform a little earlier about upcoming trouble. The ""Five minute delays"" warning is not easy to navigate. There is not difference in trying to click the small X on the top right of the little window, or simply tap the message itself. It does NOT change the route to combat the delay, nor does it make you take the faster route if offered.   When you have your navigation set to Avoid High/motor ways, and you DO decide to go on motorways after all, you should have a simple on off option to (de)activate that route setting. Instead of having to go through the route setup completely.  When trying to get an overview of the REMAINING travel route, it ONLY shows you the complete route,  without indicating where you are NOW.  Just some of my thoughts..."
"Love the interface, love the features. However... sometimes it doesn't know that roads exist when Google Maps does. It also sometimes sends me to the side of the motorway or similar, as if I'm supposed to scale a fence at the back of a business address. I love it but i can't trust it, I'm often checking the overview and zooming in to the final destination to make sure before setting off."
"I used to love this app. It's very frustrating to use now. It regularly cannot connect to or locate GPS. It's not updating with shorter routes fast enough or at all. I usually have to reset where I want to go for it to find the better route when, based on road signs, I know there's a better option. It's only sometimes accurate with arrival times. Since it's not finding better options there's constant delays popping. Please stop the ads that take up the majority of the screen. The only thing I appreciate about the app is the warnings people can add. It's the only positive at this point. I won't be recommending anymore."
Route calculation is atrocious for journeys more than about 50 miles; the quickest drive is usually completely missed and we are sent the 'scenic' way. In any case I'd rather save 10 miles than 10 seconds but there are no configuration options for that. The app has gone rapidly downhill since being taken over by Google and it's clear they are trying to run it into the ground so we all use Google Maps. But that's even worse; Google seem to have no understanding how roads work outside the USA.
"Great app, useful to get information about the traffic provided by a large community... but when you really need, it will let you down. Not reliable at all! When I'm lost, with bad internet, slow phone etc, only Google maps will save me. In different occasions, the app won't start, takes too long to respond or freezes. Waiting for improvements in the next updates"
"I've been using Waze for a very long time, but up until recently I've had to switch back over to Google Maps. I guess the shortcuts aren't so great now that everybody is taking them; but aside from the mass popularity of the app, I've noticed some major problems its been having. It won't be able to locate me, it'll get stuck in crash loops, and it's been consistently sending me down routes that end up taking significantly longer than what it says. Most times it sends me directly into traffic."
"Hi Waze, great app but a couple of features let you down. 1, it would be good if there was a ""free driving mode"" where there was no programed route but it still came up with camera warnings etc. 2, an audible speed warning, I'm on a motorcycle and looking at the screen for the speed is too hard, but having the choice of a voice warning ""speeding"" or a ""beep"": on once, on every 5 sec, off - this would be awesome to help avoid those speed tickets. 3, the option to turn on constant routing."
"The fastest route is usually the slowest This is the 2nd time the app took us on the ""fastest"" route. What is the slowest option in reality out of the 3 possible routes! (tried to select another route but still taken us on this one!!!!) The app does not take in consideration the fact that you are only able to drive quite slow on narrow, curvy, bumpy country roads with huge potholes all along, what also shake the heck out of you. We were late both times, thanks to this! Google Maps is better.."
Great app. Use it whenever I am in my car. Sometimes glitches and can't work out why. It will be following the map on the highway and then it will think I'm on a random side road. Sometimes it just doesn't know where I am and keeps jumping. This is really frustrating when I am trying to get somewhere. Brilliant features and enjoy the app except those issues.
"Such a great app, but it's riddled with bugs that make it dangerous to use! The app is constantly crashing when using Android Auto and loses GPS location all the time. As much as I love Waze, I've had to switch to Google Maps because its just too dangerous when you're relying on it to show you around unfamiliar roads. Every update brings a new bug and the support team just aren't interested in solving them."
"Bit of a mixed review. There are some things I love about this app, and some things that I don't. To start with positives. Real time traffic speeds are pretty accurate, and it really trumps Google maps with some features, such as telling you what speed your going and the roads speed limit, which is pretty accurate, it also tells you about potential hazards such as stopped cars on a motorway, police etc which is surprising accurate. The eta for journeys is also accurate most of the time. But on to the negatives. Despite loving many things about this app, I feel it's sometimes tries to be too clever for its own good. I have experimented using navigation on the way back from work hoping to spend less time in traffic, so I let it choose a route and it said 45 mins, perfect. But what I didn't realise is that it took me on some really strange roads, single track in the middle of nowhere. Usually my commute is 19 miles and takes 55ish mins with rush hour traffic, the route it suggested was probably around 30 miles (after all the route changes) and took just over 50 eventually. So generally, I'd recommend the app, but just be careful where it want to take you sometimes!"
"I wouldn't trust it for my first drives, I would use it once I'm familiar with the roads though. This app has awesome functions and it is customisable, however it's not that practical. The UI looks good but the sizing is big, half of my screen is covered with information, and things get worse when an ad shows up and takes up most of the screen. Sometimes the app recommends other routes, and that notifications takes up too much screen space."
"Great for so long but recently, it's unusable. It struggles to calculate routes, and to find a GPS signal, resets mid-route, crashes constantly and now the directions seem to be losing accuracy. By comparison using Google maps, I don't encounter any of those issues. Even had both maps running concurrently on different phones in the same car and G was flawless. Sorry Waze, was a fan for so long but we've fallen out of love"
"It depends on the phone and the quality of the built-in GPS chip I guess, it often fails to detect accurate where I am and calculate or recalculate the route fast enough to mimic real-time. This is comparing to when using Google Maps. However when it works, it qorks like a charm. Maybe the updates are making the app bulky. Not sure. Still love it. Using S8+"
"Love Waze. It's a better app and easier to use than Google maps. It clearly shows obstacles ahead. Due to the fact it's used by so many people who update it constantly. If you see an issue, animal or people on motorway you touch screen to update and it's related instantly to all around you. It also has a help button if you need help. If you are in an area you don't know it shows all the local shops, garages etc to find just what you need with distance and time"
"The overall is really useful. There a couple of things that can be improved: 1) Sometimes the arrow on the map falls behind, so you might have made the turn already, but the arrow is still lagging. For an inexperienced user this might cause confusion. 2) Sometimes you are being directed on a ""shortcut"" on very narrow streets, to avoid traffic on the main roads. But this overall takes more time ans effort, than just using the main streets."
"I absolutely love both the concept & functionality of this app, and want to be a regular participant. However, there appears to be no basic GPS/Tracking algo/logic. If my phone doesn't have clear line of sight of the sky, the map stays completely idle. I found myself driving with one hand, whilst the other holds my phone outside the car window to make this work. No such problems with Gmaps, or any of my running apps, and I'm afraid a deal breaker. Please fix / improve this. Note9."
"I wi rate this 4 stars. Is almost perfect but I have two issues. Some time ago you were trying voice commands? I can't find this option anymore. Also, apparently the last updates are using a considerable amount of data compared to previous versions. I even maxed my data plan (small 2gb) using the app. This wasn't happening before, and I am not sure what changed or if I can configure something."
"Same as Maps - in the beginning magical and very helpful. Now it's turned into the most frustrating part of driving. The application is very slow (quite often I've already taken wrong turn by the time it shows me route), inaccurate (position of roads or proposed turns often incorrect) and pauses almost non-stop. Plus, it's ETA has become incorrect. I do not have a fancy phone which is why it might be like this, but it was not initially a problem. Officially I'm looking for a new GPS now"
"This used to be a great app. Then, a long time ago, the intrusive adds starting appearing. Then, sometime ago, there were issues with the language and voice, then, not too long ago, problems started to appear with gps - until gps failed to work completely. Which is fairly essential for a navigation app. The last drop was the complete mess with restoring the account after multiple failed log in attempts after a reinstall. Starting to look for alternatives."
"The ideea behind the app is great. The functionalities are great. Interface is great. But, when i turn on my GPS and the app says no GPS all the way home (just had a 30 minute drive with this message), then, all the great features are in vain. This is not a problem that i have, iPhone users, Samsung, Huawei have the same issues and this is causing people to look for alternatives. I need to get to where i nees to go, and i don't trust waze to help me with that lately."
"I use it because It is the only app available that tells you where the radars are, that's about it. As for the rest it is bad: crashes while your are driving, cannot connect to server/internet although other apps are using internet, the ""uh sorry"" message comes around way too often when looking for addresses shared in other apps, very very slow at suggesting new routes when you miss a turn. And no, my phone is new and has lots of memory, that's not the problem."
"This app used to be great, much better than either Google maps or Apple maps. However the most recent update has not only made it much worse, it seems to have become quite dangerous. We live in Qatar, which is a desert. When you drive out of Doha, the main city, you can go for a long time without seeing anything except sand and heat. My wife and her family used Waze to navigate to a kayaking place up in the North of Qatar, about 45km north of Doha. Waze took them almost to the southernmost point of Qatar before turning back up north, but also repeatedly directed them to nonexistent petrol stations. They finally ended up at a petrol station with little more than 5km left in the tank. By definition the people who use maps apps are the people who DON'T know enough about the route to sanity check the app. My wife shouldn't have to zoom out of the map to check that Waze isn't taking her in the completely opposite direction and tripling her travelling distance and possibly putting her life at risk by leaving her stranded in a desert. The fact that we now need to do so makes the app useless. Another case, i had to drive to an animal shelter last week, a 40km trip. Waze's initial route wanted me to drive 80 km. By making one change and driving straight instead of turning when Waze wanted me to, it immediately dropped to 40km with traffic showing as all clear. Why doesn't it pick that route in the first place?!!! It's extremely frustrating, a waste of our time, fuel and patience. The previous version was much much better. Is there any way to downgrade to an older version until you fix whatever issue you are having with your new algorithms?"
"This was fantastic, I really loved the interaction and accuracy. But lately it has really been degraded. Location tracking has been way off. Especially when stationary or moving slowly, I often see my position catapulted between a 1/2 mile radius. Worse experience was when my location and voice instructions were out of sync. Being told to make a turning quite some time after the junction was bad. Really hope they sort these issues out as this used to be my go to nav app."
"I'm a taxi driver, and so I use this app for a minimum of 8 hours a day. There are a few quite major issues which really affect the app. If I switch to another app for 15 seconds or more, WAZE has lost GPS connection and freezes, necessitating a program reboot. EVERY time! Also, when first entering a location, it will bring up a completely inaccurate indicator of distance. Sometimes the real distance is over 3 times higher!"
"Huge potential to be an awesome app. Everything is good but sometimes the route it chooses could be twice the distance than a second option which could just be a minute slower. The starting position is also really bad. It takes a while to point your position. This is troublesome as if we do not know the area, we end up taking a first wrong turn. And for lord sake cut the the number of buttons we need to press to select a new destination. I think it is 3 pointless ones at the moment."
"Love this app and have used it for many years but in the recent year or so it has stopped minimising the ""where to"" bar when you don't want to set a destination. I use my phone in landscape mode and this ""where to"" bar takes up a third of the screen which is frustrating when you don't always want to set a destination, I like to use the app just generally all the time with no destination to avoid cameras etc (the point of the app) ."
"I use the app most days for work, even if I know the route, but I could be working anywhere in London. 9 out of 10 times it will be great, but I guess there are times when no route options are good. I think that the app would be improved if you had the ability to select a road to always avoid, like how you can avoid toll roads but more specifically. For instance, the route planner will try to take me through Rotherhithe tunnel in London but my vehicle cannot go down there. Good work, everyone!"
"A few times in the past after either android or android auto upgrades the app has become unusable. It was usually working again in a few days. About 3 weeks ago the same thing happened but it still isn't working. I contacted Waze 2 weeks ago and sent logs. No help there. I am about to uninstall it. It cant find my route to work until I am almost there, it loses the route and constantly freezes. Considering the fiddling I constantly have to do with this app while driving it is very dangerous."
"Tried it once, tried it again. I just cannot get over how basic the graphics are for this day and age, there are no vibrant colours, no detailed features, no high resolution graphics. Look at Sygic they are much much better graphics only thing is the routing is not great and you have to pay for some of the features. But the graphics is there."
"This is an excellent application that has accompanied me for several years. Its not perfect but definitely one of the best. Unfortunately, after updating the device to Android 10, the option of ""keep waze on top"" disappeared from the application. This is a feature that is important to me (and may save lives!). I hope that soon the application will be updated and the feature will be restored. Only then can I give waze the stars it deserves. Update 6.12.20: Its been over a year and today came an update that includes the feature of ""keep waze on top"". End of the tedious games of having to fiddle with the mobile while driving to get the application back. It's just a shame it took a year. Now the app should take care of more swift traffic updates and better AI route planning. Update 8.12.20: I was happy too fast. There is a bug that does not allow the use of ""keep waze on top"". If the device is in landscape mode, I get a wonderful black screen and I need to remove the device from the car holder and rotate it to portrait mode for the screen to turn back on. Really useful :-(. For now I keep the mobile in portrait mode, but I hope to return it to portrait mode which is much better for map viewing. You asked to reach to you in facebook, which I did few months ago. ZERO replies, like I am writing to myself. Next time when you ask for something at least have the curtesy to read it please. The bug still exists...."
"Easy to use. Offers alternative routes for routes with built up traffic, helping to keep journey's moving, and delays to a minimum. The ability to relay/receive traffic information eg, crashes or slow moving vehicles, is a great function on the app. It works abroad as well! Can't fault it, though the opportunity to download other voices would be appreciated. My go to app for travelling, whether walking, driving, or, using public transport. Keep up the good work. Kind Regards"
"I love it. While it won't replace Google Maps for general exploration, it has rapidly become my go-to app for driving. The features are great and I'm a big fan of the company's mission statement to help improve the world by reducing traffic congestion and pollution. The only reason I can't give it five stars is because there is no interconnectivity between Google Maps and Waze despite both being Google companies/orgs. What the app needs is the ability to set Waze as your default GPS/Navigation app from Google Maps after exploring a route. You'd do your research on a listing or location in Google Maps and then when it's time to drive there, Waze should be able to be set as the default app for in-car navigation. In Google Maps you can choose your own audio apps. Why can't we choose to launch Waze by default when we hit the 'Directions' button?"
"This app was really good. The voice guide is accurate and usefully tells me which side of the road to be on for tricky one way systems etc. I would have given 5 stars but recently it has started crashing and so I have to stop mid drive and restart my phone and re-enter my destination. Irritating! Even worse, now after having reinstalled waze they require my contact list. Why? I'm going elsewhere."
"Great application!  However, I've recently discovered an interesting bug in Android Auto - the area on the left side of the screen, that has information about the distance and direction to the next turn/exit (like the one that says ""In 1.5km exit to Highway 401 West"") sometimes loses the big piece of information (mostly related to the turn/intersection/exit name). The same happens with route reports, e.g., if there's a car stopped on shoulder, it displays the icon on the map, but doesn't display anything on the left (where 'Thumbs Up' and 'Not There' buttons are supposed to be).  However, based on my experience, this happens only after an ETA update message is displayed (e.g., 'Traffic is building up ahead...' etc.). This behaviour is pretty consistent, so it seems like there's something wrong with either layer re-drawing or visibility indicators for the layers responsible for route events.  My hardware is: - Head Unit - Ford SYNC 3.0  - Phone - Samsung Galaxy S8 (North America)   Let me know if you need more details on that."
"Waze is a great app, with excellent functionality and routing. But then they brought in paid points of interest such as McDonalds' restaurants and petrol stations. Ok, annoying but I can deal with that. Now there's constant banner ads that try to direct you to nearby businesses, taking up 1/3 the screen. It destroys the experience. See you later Waze."
"Would be great but is too unstable to use. I particularly liked the speed limit warning - I have tried others but this one was the best. However, the app crashed almost every time I used it. The map would freeze, and I frequently failed to realise that had happened so I just stayed on the same road and missed my turn-offs. I uninstalled and reinstalled it but it still happened. I've uninstalled it for good now. I would have given it 4 or 5 stars but an app which doesn't work is useless."
"For the past six months or so, this app just has absolutely no idea where I am. I actually use it as a joke to show people for a laugh. I have precise location settings enabled for the app, I've reinstalled etc and Google Maps knows exactly where I am, but Waze will stick me anywhere between 50m - 5 miles in the wrong place almost every time. On rare occasions it will momentarily get my location right while driving, only to start glitching out and resetting constantly, making it utterly useless."
"I've loved Waze from the start! I had an iPhone and just switched to Samsung Android device. The App works as expected when used in the device but when used in the car with Android Auto (where you would need it most) it is basically unusable. The map freezes making following the route imposible. I want to give it a five star rating but as it stands I just can't. I don't know which app is the issue if Waze, Android car or the combination of both. Hope this is fixed soon."
"Great App, but there are things which could be optimized, for example, using multiple devices with the same account doesn't synchronize the history of your search. Currently I use one smartphone as a navigation in the car, the another one is my personal smartphone, early morning when I plan my travel I search the destination on my personal smartphone, and later when I get in the car I have to search again, instead of selecting the destination from the history."
"Don't know what happened lately with the app but I just return from my vacation and the instructions were awful: not being able to connect to the internet even if the internet was working, a continuous loading state when eventualy was recognizing the internet connection, constant crash and a have 100% steps to reproduce it. One thing to mention here is that on the same route last year worked amazing. And I'm really disappointed to see that it was not working now."
"Good... but can be better. It does not highlight the correct lane to take, for example, in multi lane highways where left, middle, right lanes lead to different routes ! Only voice directions gives this indication but one has to be quick to listen and adapt. Google Maps has this functionality and because of that I missed 2 times the right direction before realising the defect!"
It is amazing app but from last couple of months or so i am struggling with the GPS. Mostly i have to restart my android phone to get it working again but sometimes even that doesn't work. Please fix this issue ASAP. I have seen feedback of other users as well they are also struggling with the same problem. I would also like to give you a suggestion....that please provide the offline maps facility similar to the way Google Maps provide. Thank you.
"I have used Waze for ages and really love this app. But recently, for no reason that I can tell (haven't changed any settings or had any updates on my phone), Waze just won't open. The first screen appears, blue with the Waze logo, and after a few seconds the screen goes black, then back to the first screen, and continues to do so indefinitely. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app 3 times, but the same thing keeps happening. Please help! I would like to continue using Waze!!"
"The concept of the app is great, but, the UI is so heavily cluttered with information it's crazy. When you initially set it up you need to tweak some settings so that you get a clearer view of the road - showing other wazers on the app, like, really? I find it overwhelming at times when you just want to see a clean map!! Do like the live traffic and the fact the map can update showing a real time view of the situation ahead. Navigation wise it's OK, Google Maps normally uses the more 'conventional' and straight forward directions whereas this will take you on a joyride of shortcuts if you choose to. Hardly use the reporting feature as I'm so focused on driving on the road but I use this app in conjunction with my car sat nav to get those traffic updates. Route direction and planning can be adjusted and on the whole the big buttons make it easy to use. Find it odd how closing the app keeps it running in the background and you need to manually close it using the power button?!?"
"Whilst this is an excellent navigation app for short journeys I have not had a good experience with journeys over 150 miles. On the occasions that I have used it for such journeys it freezes and then crashes between the 150 and 200 mile mark. Which isn't good when your southbound on the A1 and your just about to hit a junction and you don't know if you need the A1M or the M1!  Others have commented the same and yet still it happens. Like others I don't like the adverts that take prominence usually just at that vital time when directions pop up.  Others have said that Waze is now owned by Google, so surely its only a matter of time before all the good bits of Waze are combined with the reliability of Google Maps? If it wasn't for the reliability issues, always halfway through a journey, then I'd stick with Waze but sadly its not so unfortunately my go to app for navigation has gone back Google Maps."
"I like this app because it provide lots of live updates, speedometer, and re-route to avoid traffic. Although it would be a 5 if, it include a view in which lane you need to be, especially when getting close to the destination, and also never crash when using it. Fortunately it crashed in multiple occasions creating confusion."
"VERY UNRELIABLE and pretty useless. Went back to using Maps. ""Plan a drive"" feature that is supposed to load travel time estimates for future days almost never loads, the voice command feature ""processes"" my request but doesn't actually DO anything, and overall, it is laggy and struggles to connect to GPS upon start up. Restarting and re-downloading proved useless; just like this app. It was once reliable enough; a year ago (2018). Now? (2019). NO."
"UPDATE: I redownloaded the app and now it works, seems to be some sort of downtime that occurred when I tested it. Amazing app! ORIGINAL: Used to be excellent, now it doesn't load, says there is no network connection. Google Maps loads without issue, I'm listening to music through the internet in the background - I assume the service has been discontinued since I last used it, sadly."
"It works fine, but I have 2 issues: The contacts on my phone don't show up, which it did in a previous version - that's seriously annoying... It also puts a massive strain on the battery, which always overheats after about 15 minutes, no matter the temperature in my car. But please please PLEASE fix the contacts!!!!!!!"
"It's good app, but it is lug in Android Auto. There's delay between you position and on the map. It would be great if it's an option Detour just traffic, instead of find a new route. The finding route algorithm is not perfect. It gives you options of 3 route, but often it's the same route just 2-3 streets are different. And no choice to escape traffic. It doesn't work great with bridges. It suggests routes after the bridge. I have been using the app during 2 years in daily basic."
"Waze would be great if it wasn't crashing frequently. It doesn't seem to last for more than two hours of driving before freezing or crashing. Just today, I used a voice command and it froze to a black screen afterward. It's unsafe for me to have to keep force closing and restarting the app while I'm driving. I am switching back to Google Maps."
"Great navigation app with great additional functions. The speed camera notification only triggers when exceeding the speed limit, which is useless for roads with variable speed limits, or where the speed is different at the trigger point for the warning. I would like the warnings at any speed, like all the others. Also sometimes the navigation wants to take you off a main road for a short cut that will ""save"" all of a minute, but often doesn't."
"The ads that appear when you've just stopped are so distracting and annoying. This is not safe at all.. Imaging being in a traffic jam with continuous stopping and starting: almost every time waze shows an ad. It's distracting me from driving, while I should be keeping my eyes on the road. Shame on you, Waze. And there's not even a way to turn them off... Shame on you."
"Do you guys even use/test your own product? Who's idea was it to have ""my waze"" and ""where to"" bars to be constantly on the screen? 2 of them occupy 40% of my screen in the landscape mode!!! When i get traffic updates it's even more! It's unusable! Congratulations, your reached the ""decline"" stage in app development. It was perfect, but now you started changing things for the sake of changing, without adding any usefulness. Sad to see Waze go in that direction, it's been good!"
"Still drains your battery REALLY fast, even when it's charging. The user interface is far from user-friendly or easy to use. No lane guidance so it's very very easy to miss your turn. Save time, petrol, headaches and your battery, use Google Maps. It's not perfect but it's a shitload better than this garbage. Obviously built by amateurs who learnt app development from a free online course. You get what you pay for."
"My driving app for years. Until I got a car with Android Auto. It actually worked ok for a couple of versions but then started loosing GPS signal, rendering the app totally useless. Even reported the issue to support and collected debug logs on their request but a couple of months later and never heard back from them and issue remains. Oh well, gotten used to Google Maps which works perfectly."
"Brilliant but incredibly unreliable. It is in many ways the best navigation app, particularly with the speed limit display. However, it is probably the most glitchy app I've ever used and will sometimes just refuse to work at all or shuts down the entire infotainment system. If it was reliable it would be near perfect, sadly it needs a lot of work. It is also has very poor ability to plan journeys beforehand, it appears to lose all info when plugged into android auto."
"Incredibly bad routes sometimes. Update: routing just got worse. It's like the app purposely selects sub-optimal routes. Additionally, the app can't make up it's mind about the best route, every recalculation gives different routes. Also, when going off-route, the app wants to navigate back to the original route instead of finding a new best route."
"Very good application for the purpose, but for me its only 3 stars since there is no way to get rid of ads, i dont want to be distracted by some advertisements while im driving!! Now dont get me wrong i understand that they need the ad revenue to keep up the work, all i ask is a chance to support them directly and disable the ads in return. I am more than willing to pay for not having to deal with ads."
"I really love this app and would otherwise give it 5 stars, the rating is because I cant use it on my Nexus 7. Everything works exept the maps, which is the whole point..... No maps appear, just a black screen. Do you guys have a fix for that? an older version release perhaps?, I heard you changed your map engine. I really dont want to have to go to your competition. Help."
"I have been using this Waze app on Android devices for a few years now. It works great for most of the time, however.... my main concern is with the built in premium Spotify floating widget icon. It deffenilty has a mind of it's own. I have LTE+ data coverage 90% during the day and I find it doesn't want to appear in the top right corner as where it should be. I checked my settings and made sure that the Spotify icon is check marked as well. Soft restarted my device daliy as well. To the devs; What could be causing the Spotify widget to act up like this?"
"Once it calculates the route, it runs. However multiple times I had issues at the beginning while trying to get route. E.g. If you try to set the route in an undergroung parking area where internet receiving is low or none and hope it would work when connection is better, it just freezes and never wakes up. Please use more non blocking async calls. Sometimes similar happens even when there is connection. The app just says no routes could be found. If you spend some time on it retrying, it eventually finds. So the bottom line is, similar issues do not happen in Google maps, I know because I switch to Google Maps in such cases and it just works. So it is possible to make Waze more stable and robust. Please do it."
"Used to be great. And I would always recommend it to others however, I have recently found it makes a right mess of the navigation. Last few times I've used it, it deliberately takes you down roads with roadworks. Why? I have no idea. The roadworks even show on the map so it's not like it doesn't know it's there. Other issue I've noticed several times is it gives you quick route options but then adds delays later. it doesn't cater for traffic and this was always one of the main benefits of Waze."
"Very clunky design, awful controls, also doesn't show nearby landmarks. - Design is not sleek, very old-school looking. - The controls aren't smooth, tends to rubber band a lot or snap around while dragging. Zooming out sometimes doesn't register and when it does it zooms out insanely quick and far. Can't change map angle only zoom in/out. - Doesnt show nearby landmarks similarly to Google Maps when you zoom in (Hospitals, colleges, stores, etc.) Love the concept, it has a lot of potential."
"This used to be the best thing ever. But in the last 2 months, it keeps getting stuck or it says searching for network. Some times, mid journey, it would recalculate, then crash. A few times landing me stranded in the middle of no where. And can't reconnect. Google maps worked, but waze died on me. Tried uninstall and reinstall, does nothing. Please fix. Thanks"
Great app but needs offline maps options. Really leaves you stranded if you don't have data or a loss signal. Not to mention outages etc. Also it needs a major update because it doesn't use the fastest route. 1 day the highway was backed up told me to get off and go an entirely different route. I noticed people got off at the exit and got back on the highway after the bridge and traffic was clear. Waze should have caught this. Lately it feels like they are dropping the ball.
"Lately, the app has had some issues in terms of network detection. For example, my phone has an Internet connection, but Waze failed to detect the Internet connection by showing the ""Searching Network..."" on top of the screen. I tried disabling the Internet access and switching on and off Flight mode. The ""Searching Network..."" wording did disappear sometimes, but it will still be there (most of the time) after some moments. I hope that the developer team can investigate this issue and resolve the network detection issue as soon as possible. It has been months since this happened, and it kept annoying me while driving. Thank you so much in advance."
"Until latest update the app worked great. Now, when it has something on the road ahead it simply crashes and I have to reopen the app all the time, which is a huge problem when you actually drive. I cleared the storage (cache+data) and wanted to login to the app from scratch, but because my account was connected to facebook, it didn't work and now I've lost lots of favorites and my account settings and I have to start from zero. Or... I'm now free to choose any other nav app, thanks to the devs"
"Previous problems with not picking up a GPS signal seem to have rectified by itself...not sure it's anything I did! The app is functioning well and keeps me updated about the best route to take, based on any delay causing factors. It does though, take me to odd/difficult right turns with traffic both sides and refuses to use a shorter route at some one or two specific places, otherwise, it is perfect. Oh...and yes, it seems to permit saving only limited number of 'favourites', for some reason!?"
"While this app surely isnt bad, it's simply not good enough to use as a reliable GPS. Data depends heavily upon number of users and willingness of said users to update what is going on the road, closures, traffic jams, temp. roadworks, etc. As long as this info is up to date and plentiful, all is good. But from where I am, it rarely is up to date, so this GPS becomes frustrating and borderline useless: wrong eta, wrong path taken etc... and dont get me started on how it crashes 75% of the time."
Crashes during just regular driving for no reason. It restarts then crashes again. Rinse and repeat. It happened 3 times in a row before i just unplugged my cable. This was my first time using it and I only installed it because I read an article about its update and stability. Not to stable if you ask me. Ill continue to check it out and give it a far chance but you only get 1 first impression.
"App works fine, but it is made that you do all your trip plan before you sit in the car. When I try to use it on the fly (e.g. I smell a traffic jam and I would like to check if there is a better route) it is soooo many clicks to get to the suggested route, it is almost ridiculous! I even have to disconnect it from the car to choose destination and connect it again."
"Pretty good, when it works... I found the maps to be accurate and traffic reports speed camera locations are all very handy or would be. The trouble is most of the time it just sits there trying to find a GPS signal. I've waited it out a couple of times and it takes nearly 30 minutes. I've given up trying to use it now but hopefully a future update will fix this."
"EVERYONE needs to have this app. Even the do-gooders who stick to the limit ALL THE TIME, EVERY TIME lol. It's better than any map app out there in every way shape n form so it's definately going to be helpful for anyone who needs directions, or wants to find the cheapest fuel between where they are n where they're going, wants real-time reports of road-accidents, closures, traffic jams etc etc. I've never written a review before but felt that this NEEDED to be raved about, it's super amazing!"
"Dangerous and distracting Frankly, I love Waze. But recently it has implemented pop-up advertising which appears on the screen while driving and which does not go away automatically. One has to click elsewhere on the screen to get rid of it. These popups often block critical navigation information, rendering the app useless if you're a driver and don't have a passenger to run the app for you. I understand that advertising is necessary to pay for costs. It absolutely should NOT this intrusive."
"It was quite good. But has a few issues you cannot set destination by pointing to a location while the app is on a car screen. Have to disconnect. Uses Google maps but search give different results and not good ones, etc And for some reason location services become cr*p. So GPS position and speed is shown only for a few seconds. Most of the time the app has no idea where am I. First I thought my phone is wrong. But started using Maps and no such issues. Not sure how it's possible..."
"Tried this for a few days, but I really could not see what all the fuss was about.  I was using this on my pioneer head unit, compared to google maps the detail on waze is hard to see. I struggled to identify street names as it didn't seem to zoom in as close as google maps. It would zoom out no problems but the closet view  was still too far away for me.  It was showing heavy traffic on roads that had barely any traffic and yet the road that was bumper to bumper was a clear run.  The only good thing I liked about Waze was the speed indicator. I have deleted the app and gone back to using google maps."
"This just keeps getting worse. Yesterday the app sent me down the worst possible route... I recently moved to the North West and I rely on GPS. Every update seems to result in GPS being wrong and waze doesn't know where the car is. Unfortunately I got badly lost today, took a wrong turn on the motorway and this resulted in roughly an extra 40 minutes on the road. Not good enough, really. We provide you with data, it's not exactly a ""free"" app! We're not stupid and we expect a better service."
Recent update crashes Waze upon startup. Please fix. Using Android Auto.
"I enjoy the app but there are a few things to improve, mainly the zoom buttons, there are so slow and cumbersome to use, not always responding, unable when driving. Make 2 big buttons far apart or better still double tap and swipe up or down like google maps for good one handed use. Also, cluttered screen, I'd like to be able to easily remove the car info button from the screen. A useful feature would be to color code dual and single carriageways so I can plan my route according to those."
"Have been using Waze for many years. There're some bugs on the current version. The map was showing to turn right but the voice was telling me to turn left. I still prefer the pervious version as it won't suddenly pop out funny left/right arrows without road name while driving. Lastly, please always have an updated map so that it won't bring us to a longer route. Thanks."
"Using waze for a couple of years. Good but there are some annoying issues with the latest versions. If you put a destination and then close the screen, and don't start moving within 2 min, waze will close. Yes I've set all permissions and to allow runing in background and not to optimize for battery usage and same. For a motorcyclist this is super annoying since you put your destination, gear up and leave and then realize your not hearing any instructions. Same issue with my co-worker as well."
"The adverts get right in the way when you're stupid trying to see your route, sometimes you'll hit them by accident and the screen will change as you are driving. The gui design leaves a lot to be desired. If rather part a flat fee but it's an option the developer chose to not do. There are too many alternatives to waste your time on something sub standard."
"It is a very useful app but I can't give it 5* because of two things. The app cannot work while screen is off/device is locked. For instance I know the route and would like the app to notify me about accidents, alerts or speed cams while the phone is in my pocket. Second, the sound before recalculating the route if you don't chose the suggested one is extremely annoying! It almost makes me stop using the app for navigation. It would be good if the app is able to use external GPS too."
This app is a hit and miss. When it's working (75% of the time). It's great and does what it says. when it doesn't work it's trash. Sometimes my arrow on the map doesn't move or my speedo dissapears. But when it works it's is a fantastic app. Beats google maps anyday. I also think that you need to add school zones in. It's a must. Waze has saved me from so many speed cameras. Please add school zones for Australia. Most modern car navigation systems show school zones. My parents Volvo shows it.
This used to be one of my favourite apps with Android Auto but in the last 2 months it has been unusable almost all of the time. It won't find a route & keeps spinning away. On the few occasions that it has it has frozen on the map mid route. It's now totally worthless & I've had to start using the infinitely duller but more reliable Google Maps. Great shame.
"Excellent... when it works. This little Sat-Nav really is a godsend, hundreds of thousands of uk users who regularlly update any and all issues on the road, including traffic, accidents, roadworks, closures, hazards onroad, and those cheeky hidden speed vans, (who are clearly only there for our safety and not as a revenue stream nudge nudge wink wink). However recently it has really been struggling with the dreaded ""Searching for Network"" error, which is fine if it already has the route and that part of the map cached offline, you lose all but the most basic functionality including voice directions, but the route still shows on screen. However if that particular location isn't already cached you are SOL, e.g. last night I drove 55 miles to a location at 4pm, no issues, full connectivity, driving home at 11:30 (same route, other side of road) still 4g connection most of the way, ""Searching for network"" the whole way home, including when connected to the WiFi outside my house, so clearly an issue on their end not mine."
"1. Please distinguish between flyovers and road directly above ground, perhaps using very different colors or very apparent difference in road width. 2. If the app can show the current lane of the vehicle and the lane to use like Google Maps, that will be great. 3. After updating the app on 18.01.2019, I cannot fix the zoom function, making the map constantly zoom in and zoom out depending on vehicle speed. I prefer the old app, because I can disable the auto-zoom function."
"app is becoming increasingly less reliable; sending me down longer routes, changing the route after i've selected my preferred option, & abruptly ending directions before i've gotten to my destination. it's handy that you can pinpoint a difficult spot in the map when you get to it, but not great that it asks for a description while you're driving; would be safer if it pops up at the end of your trip."
"Could be better! I've come to this app after 8 years of Google maps. I think this app would be perfect if it took a page out of Google maps book. Seeing a list of alternative routes and times is old news & outdated and reminds me of an old sat nav from 2009. It's much more convenient to physically see them on the map while showing you the way you will be going & the time it will take, while also providing continuous alternative routes visibly along your route. Waze get some ideas from Google!"
"Disappointing when the app took me down 30 minutes of single lane roads (near Llandovery) with only a few passing places, to bring me back out to the main road at a point that would have taken me 10 minutes to reach if I'd stayed on the main roads. Not an easy journey in a motor-home. It would be better if different size vehicles could be selected instead of taxi or car."
"It is getting worse for the recent version. The choice of route has been removed where we can't choose the shortest route or fastest route no more. Hence if we choose a route which is not the default and waze will just change to the default selection if ""something"" is detected wrong. Always lead to the farther road, so frustrating. And for toll, even you choose non tol road, and after self adjustment by waze, it will turn back to toll road. The ""common sense"" by waze is no longer there!"
"It's a fantastic app! The ability to to access road conditions and traffic and contribute in real time, on the fly, is really awesome! I'm holding back the other star until it gets an update that'll keep it open, even as a small active tile over all apps (including phone calls) so its never off the screen while driving. I'm keeping this star ‚≠ê until you do that."
"Its a great app, but there is room for improvement. I think Waze should probably include 'emergency' options like petrol station (bubble on the screen) as the person heads to a destination. This option would help the driver get to the nearest petrol station along the assigned route without having to create a new drive there or type for that matter."
"Great when it works but bug ridden. Keeps crashing , usually about 3 to 4 times on a 280 mile trip. Notifications often don't sound so unless you are looking at the screen you won't see them. Doesn't always auto reroute, if the manually select to look at the routes often there is a quicker one. Seems to be getting worse and more unreliable as an app."
"Though overall this app does its job well (baring the occasional crash mid-route), I am incredibly frustrated by the voice command feature, which I use heavily to remain hands-free. Some of the pain points include : - Needs me to repeat a few times before it registers. - Doesn't register voice input unless you wait 3 seconds after the beep. - ask for confirmation, even when it accurately heard 99% of the time. - doesn't handle interruptions as well as alexa or Google assistant"
"The advertisements are annoying and dangerous while driving. I like the concept of the app, allowing you to warn other drivers of police, crashes, road hazards etc... But the advertisements that constantly pop up while driving and while you're stopped are so annoying and honestly dangerous. It even asks you questions and gives survey while you're stopped at lights, which is distracting. thought this app was so amazing until the ads started popping up, now I'm going to switch back to google maps."
"I really like the design of this app, and I would prefer to use it as my GPS app. Unfortunately it is too complicated to use hands free and it crashes too often. The integration with Google Assistant is poor. Until these bugs are fixed I will go back to my 'old' app. Please always keep the Assistant microphone on top. Searching for a destination should be easy-to-use in an app designed for driving. It should not be the cause of distracted driving. Not recommended for Android 10 car head unit ."
I would like to give it a 5 star but I have a serious problem with turning notifications. I would like to have them delivered faster with few seconds (like ford sync3 maps is doing for example) and not in front of a turn when I have no time to turn anymore. I get it that this probably comes from google maps but maybe something can be done. When this will change I'll change my review.
"Great App, helps a lot in managing traffic. But after the update, there is a delay for about 2 seconds when you click the app to run. So it is quite annoying for the delay time, it makes you feel that you're not clicking on the right icon. Really appreciate if you fix the issue. I'm using Galaxy A8 and A5 (both with the same issue) Thanks"
"I've been using this app for over a year now and I only wish I'd downloaded it sooner. It blows my stand alone satnav into the weeds in every respect. The graphics are very clear and the live alerts are a god send, informing you of things that a stand alone system just wouldn't register. One example is object in road, alerted in good time I was able to make a safe and timely manoeuvre instead of having to take evasive action. Height restrictions in car parks is all that's missing."
"I usually use Google maps and now have maps in my car so I don't use Waze that much. I tried it out again the other day and while some things look cleaner in the app there are some regressions. The inability to hide the search bar at the bottom, especially in landscape mode is a real problem. One that apparently has been around for over 2 years. I want a passive mode where I do not need to enter a destination."
"I'm the same as everyone else, this app used to be fantastic, but now I have nothing but issues with android auto in the car. Constantly says no network connection, cannot locate me on the map, cannot enter a location into the search, most of the times the car screen is now pale blue and absolutely useless. Please fix ASAP. I love this app"
"Waze is great! A suggestion I have is when I'm using Android auto and experience congestion, traffic, construction etc.. I want to be able to tap that icon once to start it, and then when it ends, tap it again. I find that just touching the icon to alert other wazers doesn't let you show the full length of how long and bad the problem is. Touch to start, touch again to stop."
"The app was great for quite a while, proved very useful to find alternative routes and I use it very frequently. However, I had to uninstall it after multiple times when it froze my phone touch screen completely, so ended up having to reset my mobile (I ran numerous trials to check with other apps, but definitely came from Waze) or would not find the GPS signal which is working fine otherwise, so it became more frustrating than anything. if these issues get sorted, I will gladly reinstall it.."
Great app for speed cameras and anticipating traffic probs. You can add issues so live info is good. It doesn't tell you what lane to get into a useful feature in Mapps. The speed cam warning stays on far too long so 2 cameras in close proximity can be confusing. Worse thing is any time after about 90 it shuts itself down. I do 3.5 hr commute twice a week and every time it switches itself off partway into my drive. Fix the last 2 issues and it would be mint.
"In theory this is a great app, I love the fact users can warn others of traffic, potholes etc. In reality it's so glitchy it's impossible to use. When I open the app it takes ages to actually find my destination and sometimes I have to restart the app a few times, the car on the map doesn't follow the journey properly so it's thinks you're somewhere else which again means restarting the app or using Google maps instead. I want an app I can rely on and I can't rely on Waze."
"Great navigation. However, since they added speed camera alerts, the menu option to turn off red light alerts has been missing. Tech support's solution was to link me to a help article telling me to go into the menu and turn off the alerts. Except, they obviously didn't read my one sentence complaint- the missing menu option. They don't listen to users, they talk to you like an idiot.So the app is great unless it isn't and you need support. Their response is from an earlier review."
"I have been using the app for more than a year as a motorcyclist. I can say it has been improved in terms of crashing, which was a real pain on the past, as I was using only the audio for guidance, I sometimes wouldn't know if the app was still active or not. I recently purchased something to hold the phone on the handle bar, and on my first trip with the app. After like an hour and a half of riding. It showed a prompt to link the google assistant that never disappeared since I had gloves on!!!"
"It's great but ... if you don't have GPS signal then this app is completely useless. This is particularly problematic in tunnels. It should be able to use the ""assisted"" GPS feature to continue to provide information visas mobile internet, and more importantly, the input features should work so that one can update any traffic information for other users."
"Really good app but I'm missing some features like: having the ability to have offline maps, custom distance before an announcement like roadworks and others as now it's really short, would be nice to see services on the map when you're driving long distances and when's the next one. Also has issues with the three finger and ok waze as it doesn't even work for me, if you change between apps it drops the Spotify support which is annoying and you need to close and reopen the app to get it back... Other than that still better than Here, Google maps and others :)"
"Has fundamental flaws that a satnav should never have. Top of the list is that you can't tell it to plan routes based on vehicle restrictions, such as height, width, and weight. It will insist on taking a van through rotherhithe tunnel, which will result in a heavy fine. Further to this, there is no way to add roads or areas you wish to avoid at all times, and no way to easily modify your current route to bypass something."
"This used to be a good and interactive driving navigation app. Now it has a very clumsy and non-intuitive* user interface, and function-wise comes nowhere near the usefulness of Google Maps. *For example, who would guess you need to tap the search icon to go to settings. Or when the app knows there is road work somewhere on your route, it refuses to show you any details, such as WHERE it is."
Inaccurate. Takes one on a longer route and a much longer time to arrive and changes routes suddenly. Basically takes one round the world rather than the intended destination
"It worked fine before the latest update but now it just keeps saying ""No network connection. Try again later."" and boots me out the app even thought both data and location are turned on and working on my phone. In short, I can not use this app anymore. Edit: if anyone else encountered the same issue, you may want to try uninstalling and re-downloading the app. It worked for me. I honestly should have done that before rating the app 2 stars. I will now rate the app 5 stars."
"An app with huge potential but falls down on buggy and what seems like perpetual Alpha development. I run it on an Android in car system that displays Waze somewhat like on a tablet. It seems to behave better on a phone.  Speed cameras are randomly announced; sometimes they are and some aren't, even though they appear on screen as being present. The direction announcements are clipped short - missing the first two words of every direction given. Maps seem adhoc in there updates. Speed signs are always out of date, and in the most recent map update (for Australia at least) have regressed to no signed speed at all - even on major roads like the Gateway Highway Streets that were previously signed with a speed now have no speed sign advice at all. Registration and sign in takes me in perpetual circles. I could go on. It is a highly frustrating app. But I am hooked on its ""live"" reporting feature and that is the only reason I still put up with it.."
"I've been using Waze for many years. Up till recently it has been very problematic for me. It always searches for network (even when my network is working fine). Also, it keeps crashing halfway while navigating to my destination. To add on to this, the route constantly recalculates and brings me to a wrong location. I deleted and reinstalled Waze a few times hoping it'll be better but it still sucks. I don't know what's wrong but please fix it."
Been using Waze for a very long time now. Up until October 5th it worked excellent with Android auto. Now I cannot load Waze through Android auto. Everytime I try to launch Waze I get a black screen that freezes everything. Oddly enough both programs and my phone say no updates were installed. Can't figure out. Looks like it's back to google maps.
"Edit: Ads popping up WHILE you are driving. Are you kidding me? They cover half the screen and dim it! --------------------- It would have been perfect only if it showed you what lane you should be in like Google Maps. I have to switch between the two ad frankly, would choose Google Maps over Waze from a functional point of view."
"Use this app if you wish to double your travel time: I used Waze a few years ago and really liked the app, but it did not support the built-in GPS of my car. Recently, I tried Waze again and was happy to see that I have no longer connection problem in Android Auto. I now tried it twice and both times had a horrible experience. It takes me on all these small streets and still fails to find the most direct route. So back to Google maps unfortunately."
"Love the app, it's easy to use and wonderfully smart. The navigation voices are nice and smooth (except Simon who becomes a demon when he announces an average speed zone). The integration with Spotify is nice but I'd like to be able to like songs from Waze. I'd also prefer if the app didn't automatically take me on a 20km route for a 5km trip, if there's a small delay or slightly more traffic lights I'd really rather take that over wasting petrol."
"Could be better. Having just bought a new car I am using waze for the first time. I have been a dedicated gps user for years. I find there are features missing. Definitely need a on screen current route option to allow you to add, delete or cancel current route. Very annoying when driving. There doesn't seem to be an exit option other than through the phone."
"The inability to customize the sequence of favourite destinations is the major drawback of this App. Most Apps that include lists allows users to customize the sequence of the lists. Why not this one? It's not rocket science. It's extremely annoying that I have to wade through dozens of favourite destinations especially when I'm driving, when the most used ones are buried in my list because I happen to have chosen them before others. Fix it now!"
"Love the routing, usually, and the up to date reporting. But search is broken at the moment - won't show correct results for a post code, or even a street name search. Also gets stuck having chosen a destination, refusing to display a route at all. These are two pretty critical issues that have been reported but not resolved, and are the reason it's impossible to recommend the app if you are going somewhere new! *Edit - generally above issues are Res oved. Great driving app"
I love this app. Directions are clear and I have been rerouted many times allowing me to miss huge traffic jams. I do have a issue where it often freezes the first time you connect it to Android auto. The actual freeze happens after you choose your location and it opens the map to direct you. then it is stuck at a spot and not actually following you. at this moments (after driving few km without it unfreezing) I change to Google Maps.
"Seemingly not currently compatible with Android Auto and my music player of choice. Whenever I have Waze installed, my music will constantly stop and start randomly, as soon as I uninstall Waze the music player behaves itself again. This is a shame because it's clearly an app with great potential, but I've been trying the app every so often in the hope this has been fixed, hopefully one day I'll be able to install it and have it work correctly."
"It used to run in the background or when the screen is off. But now, they denied such a well requested feature because, i assume, they want to show you ads. Also, it seems like they won't show you the fastest route anymore, (2021 edit) so you're using the app longer where they can show you ads. Just use google maps."
"Been using ways for several years and it used to be my go-to, over Google Maps and my car sat nav. Even recommended to friends. However, recently I've been very disappointed with the app. It's navigating routes that are taking longer than they should, not recognising no entry roads, taking me on motorways unnecessarily. No idea what you guys have done and I'm not impressed. If it doesn't improve soon I'll be uninstalling."
"Lots of useful features that are missing in other GPS apps, such as road speed limit, speedo and warning. Community-based info and broadcast facility which is truly inspired. My criticism is that the UI is not very intuitive, with buttons in weird places or sometimes not there at all. The voice selection screen doesn't play a short sample either, which I think is a necessity. Configurable colours and fonts ought to be available for the map display. However, a very good app."
"sometimes when changing the destination or minimizing the application, a message appears about the loss of the GPS signal. At the same time, the map freezes for 30-50 seconds. If at the same time you forcefully close the application and open it again, everything works, but it does not show how much time is left on the road and show ""connecting"". If you close and open for the third time, it starts to work well"
"I really love how this app gives me warnings about road conditions ahead, but I'm really frustrated by the route selections it makes. It seems to choose the longest route ever so often. I can't afford to always open up the routes options to make a manual selection for every drive. I don't see any settings to make the app select the shortest route possible. Edit* I have since stopped using it, the string of wrong directions and long dumb routes was just too much for me. I'm back to Google Maps."
"If you want a gps app that only works half the time, then this is the app for you! Constantly gives ""error calculating route"" message when you have full bars! Urgently need to get directions? Just open google maps it never fails. No they don't have flowers driving cars but it's more reliable. Also half the time it doesn't predict traffic."
"I honestly think this is the most overrated app in the store. It has many nice features I like (avoiding toll roads based on the country, spotify integration, etc.) but... 1. I need to restart it every once in a while - seems like when the phone loses internet connection several times, Waze fails to reconnect. It will just show looking for connection forever. ALL the other apps reconnect without problems right away. I need to shut Waze down completely and turn it on again, then it works. 2. No junction view - this feature has been coming since forever and it is STILL not here, it makes driving in an unknown city a real pain. Literally all the other major players have it. No ""route bar"" - so I never know what is upcoming, where the traffic jam is. There are also many other small things, like it cannot estimate your position in a long tunnel and so on. So for me Waze is a good looking toy but there are better navigations out there (even tho they are not free)."
I've had this app for a couple of years and it used to work very well. The last couple of months the map works very slow and screen is very erratic. Also sometimes when set a destination it would stop giving directions. This caused me some problems when I was going to places I'm not clear on the exact directions.
"So much better than google maps. When it finds a better route on long drives, it doesnt send you back 20 minutes the opposite direction like maps did many times, it offers sensible route changes that actually save time. It has the most live map; I like that i get warned when theres an obstacle in the road approaching. There's so many settings to fiddle with and customize, especially the alerts. I like to have the speedo on all the time and noise when I exceed it. 100% will shout about it!"
"This app would be very good and useful, but ... Navigation within biult-up area works wrongly. Instead of one simple and safe turning, it navigates into a lot of zigzag operations on minor roads which result unnecessary turnings and dangerous situations (more crossings, etc.). Other applications do not do this. Otherwise, out of built-up areas, works well. Navigation mode should be able to set by the user, or make some fine tuning on that. Until this is not solved and it can not be used in cities or villages in normal mode, only one star is given."
"An excellent app for traffic and incidents. However I'm really disappointed at the results when searching for a new location, especially on voice via Google assistant. Either the actual results is way down the selection list or it's just a general reference. Considering this app is owned by the main search engine in the world it's pretty dissapointing."
"I've been using it for a very short time and the navigation seems to be working well. However I noticed that the map doesn't center correctly and instead keeps the car arrow on the lower right corner of the screen, hiding half of the route. At first I thought this was a problem with my tablet and I tried to Google it. I saw many people complaining of the same problem back in 2016 and either is a feature of the app (???) or a bug that wasn't fixed. Either way it almost completely ruins the app."
"Heard good things, but experience has been poor so far. Slow searches, occasional crashes and fails to search when Google maps has no trouble at all, particularly using voice. That's the problem, Google maps is so easy that any competition has to be as good or better. Basic searching for addresses and route planning are unreliable and slow. You'll need to know where the cameras are because you've just wasted 10 minutes on your driveway! (I do not condone speeding even if waze made you late!)"
"The apps is okay, but missing few items, such as a transparent or black navigation key for apps with soft navigation key (back home and app switch). In landscape view there's no overview bar (traffic from blue to red which I believe could easily add at the bottom or top of the screen), and there's no lane assist like google map. If you're able to add all of this, you would easily be an apps worth 5 starsüëçüèª."
"It's OK-ish, but two things made it unusable for me. Firstly, the fact that you cannot just lock your route - they will keep trying to ""optimize"" your route, no matter what. I wish you could turn off this behaviour in settings. Most of the time I select specific routes for a reason and I don't want the app to mess with my selection! Secondly, the black screen issue in Android Auto hasn't been solved for years now. I feel like they're taking a mickey with it by now."
"App has become very unreliable in Malaysia. This is my experience over the past year or so. I have reinstalled app many times and changed my phone (to a flagship, hence not a phone limitation) during this period. Constantly unable to search locations and navigate. Always receive 'something went wrong & Try again', especially during peak hours. Takes about 2 min to set up navigation vs. 10 seconds on Google maps. Almost as though Waze has insufficient bandwidth/ server capacity in the country."
"Waze went through a really bad period there where it was constantly losing GPS, though versions since 4.7 have seemed to resolve the issue. The only issue of late I've noticed is that if you start a navigation, and start playing music, the first time Waze sends you a verbal notice (upcoming turn warning, for instance), the music will mute. It's still playing, but no audio is coming out. If you hit pause and then play, the music resumes, and the problem doesn't reoccur. Just a minor bug."
Would use over google maps except one very critical issue. The map guidance doesn't direct you into the parking lot or space at your destination but ends on the main road and that's it. Driving down the main road and the arrow ends and you have no way to park or even realize that you're at the building. Google maps would actually tell you to merge off and direct you in the lot. Missed many turn offs due to this issue and I had to dump it
"Ok layout and screen, but inflexible in its route selection, and there never good ways and if you want to follow the short way from the start of one and finish following a different option, it'll have none of it. I know the direct line is shorter but your only choice is to go back a town along the highway, because the 20 minute more option is what you wantüôÑ. Also the timing on turns is bad as it will tell you to turn right just as you approach an earlier street."
"The app has been sub-standard for too long now. When you shut it down it continues to run in the background and even telks you it is! The 'close' button does nothing. As for routes, clearly not enough people are bothered to inout data as it frequently sends me towards what I can plainly see are traffic jams. Yup, pretty much done with it now. Can anyone recommend something that is as good as Waze used to be?"
"Like: Display, friends can view drive. Hate: Waze hit road closures (checked Google Maps and they show the closures and avoid). Annoying beep everytime you go off route and it replans, you cant switch the sound off without removing all other sounds. Google Maps shows on screen the time difference of all other roads during your journey should you wish to change routes. I've been delayed many times as a result of Waze. Google Maps shows road colours based on congestion."
"Great navigation app but I would love for there to be a shortcut to change the voice prompts volume on the go without having to go through entire settings as I sometimes have music loud and sometimes not and then I don't hear Waze. Also Wazw does not work for me through Android Auto on my new car which is frustrating. Keeps telling me I haven't finished setup for the first time, when I've been using Waze for a few years now. And Waze doesn't even open on my phone when connected via USB"
"Loving it so far. Much better accessibility than Google Maps, some delving is necessary in the menus to get things 'comfortable' but, nothing extraordinary. So, in summation, I've finished . Deary me, it seems I have not, in fact, finished. My earlier enthusiasm for Waze has sadly, declined, declined the point of Google maps, yes, driven away by the near constant adverts for, to me at least, local businesses. I'd not gladly, exactly, but still willingly, pay for a less intrusive version.üòò"
"Landscape mode has become unusable because of the lower third of the screen being taken up with input text boxes. When driving without the need of navigation I expect to be able to see the whole screen. Navigation options are also bizarre, compared to Google Maps the choice of routes seems to be a random mystery tour. That said it would still be my go-to navigation app if the screen was more user friendly."
"Had high hopes and the map is good and I looked the look of it. However, Waze requires you to handle your phone while driving waaaay too much. There are popups that block your map until you click to clear them off. And popups like ""red light camera"" warning that doesn't auto clear off. Also, the Spotify doesn't connect right, I have it connected in Spotify and Waze constantly says I need to connect it. Way too much having to pay attention to my phone while driving so back to Google maps for me!"
"I would give it a negative but it is not an option. Ever since the automatic update to the application it won't give an ETA or show the route I chose. It just says can't connect or something went wrong. It also sets routes that are adapted to public transportation even though my vehicle settings are set to private. Generally I know the way and I use Waze to avoid traffic, this is no longer possible. I think I will move over to Google maps. So sad because Waze used to be the absolute best."
"The best Satellite navigation app around. Not perfect, but with a few minor modifications it would remove the need to consider using any other navigation system period. It could use the ability to add current location to favorites. Recently I've been experiencing less then ideal routes. For example, I ignored a left turn which is located 35 metres from the departure location and the drive time difference is over 20 minutes regardless of traffic."
"This app has been very good at predicting traffic conditions in busy town areas and main routes that lots of users are using. When you go more rural it isn't as good and reporting road closures seems to get more difficult with every update. Recently seems to lag a little behind where we actually are, tried on 4 different phones and run alongside Google maps and Co-pilot, it is definitely app specific. Can be an issue when you have several turn offs close together and miss the correct junction."
"I like that I can chose from a selection of voices and the user updated format is a great idea and a big help. Even if you don't need directions Waze is, worth using for all the other route information. Could be more user friendly by offering all route options immediately. When I navigate to route options, not all possible routes are available. If I take a route not offered, then it persistently tries to rerout me to it's own choice which can be annoying."
"An App I want to like better but even on a fast phone (note9) map lags actual position and it is EASY to miss turns! Also, the one stop trip limit, is - well - too limiting. Need to map out a journey that has multiple stops, not (almost) one by one. Really frustrating for voice commands as well. Google maps is WAY better. Not really all that much to like here, despite hype. Also, server response is very slow as well."
"The app interface is very good, the navigation software is top tier, in my opinion, and the voices are great. However i wish there were more variety in what they say, if there is traffic, when we reach our destination, and so on, i wish that they would have lots of options in what they say, to make the journey funnier, cooler and more magical. My point is that i wish they would have 3 or 5 sentences to choose from when the app says something. I hope you would consider my idea."
You guys need to add more features for board screen car display. It's impossible to change toll features and things like that there. And waze always choose the more mileage way
When the phone is on landscape the navigation arrow is not in the center of the screen ( on the right corner) is it possible to fix this
Excellent app only prob I can't make it not disappear sometimes also opens on a browser not the app settings are missing Michelle pappas
"Alerts remain stuck on screen. Cleared cache, uninstalled and reinstalled app and problem was not solved"
"App has been freezing/losing gps through android auto so I have gone back to maps. Yes, phone is up to date. Yes, clear signal and still loses the GPS. Hopefully they get it fixed"
Love the simplicity of use. Easy peasy to set up. Great to use on my Tricity trips outa town.
"You messed up trying to find the primary care centre Colchester, took me on a wild goose chase through a housing estate. The latest is waze shutting down when stopping for petrol whilst using voice directions only with ear plugs on a motorcycle, very annoying. Here we are more than a year later a d your app still crashes when using just the audio direction with the screen locked, most frustrating."
"Great when it was working on my s10 but recently upgraded to s20 and now it remains stuck on the ""just a sec"" screen. Uninstalling, clearing cache and data, restarting phone etc... Doesn't work"
The app has been freezing regardless of my cell service. It has been super frustrating and unsafe as I am having to try to fix it while driving.
"1. Speed limit icon on android auto too small 2. Average speed measurement zone alert is in a different langauge that I can't change; also can't turn off the alert just for this. Changing the voice has no impact on this. Phone, waze, normal alerts all in English. Average speed in different language and much louder than rest of waze. Super annoying."
"Using Waze for years now, but recently the fuel type setting seems to be gone... Please bring it back!"
"Great app! Just sadly give it only 3 stars because the the vocal warning for sleep radars is not reliable, which is a very important feature, since it could save us some money. Sometimes it calls it out, sometimes it doesn't. So I don't feel at ease not looking at the screen every once in a while. Hoping it gets fixed so I can give the 5 stars it deserves!"
"When it works it's great but if you have any login issues it's ridiculous. Password resets don't work, online help doesn't help, app stuck in connecting..."
This was a great app but for the last few weeks the arrow spins around and won't track correctly. Freezing on Android auto. Now unusable.
"Waze gets stuck at ""just a sec"" screen (this screen shows up immediately after ""updating maps""). After awhile, the waze app just freezes."
"App is great, especially as the user base grows. But why is there no setting to include charging stations for EV vehicles? I think that's a major missed opportunity for forward thinking."
"Used to be great, now don't work with Android auto"
The routes you now give on waze I can probably walk faster . Why did you get rid of the faster route options ? It seems to me you want to destroy WAZE and frustrate people so they can now use your flagship google maps all the time . Not impressed with your updates you should now rename it MAZE ü§¶üèøü§¶üèø
"Always reliable, the app design & features the stuff you are able to do example choice of vehicle, the voice type etc. Is so much fun, it doesn't make the whole experience boring the same look all the time you can make it fun for users and just overall it's like a game. Easy to navigate through and I love that it allows you to check on what time you need to arrive at a certain place whether on that day or another day & tells you the time you should leave at location choosen."
"Torture to use with Android Auto, as it lags and it's slow and buggy, even prompting you to type on your phone instead of the car's screen as a workaround. Battery usage is absolutely excessive, at least on Android Auto anyway. Still no support for electric cars. It's nice in theory but the experience is so painful that it impacts the driving experience."
"As i am a new driver i like Waze,as it tell which lane shall i follow to reach the destination. It's really an amazing featureüòç"
A GPS app to have! Like the user interface and that you can report a problem on the road.
Disappointed. Why have you removed all the fixed Cameras on the app for South Africa. I was recently tralleving on the N3 not even 1 notification on all the cameras i passed. App used to be the best. Now Google Maps is starting to look better.
It's as bad as Google maps of which has been sending me in circles and rerouting me while in transit.
"This app used to be so good, now it's bug after bug after bug. It either just closes or keeps telling me to turn on location when it's already on. Please fix these bugs."
Great app very useful but annoying if out of signal you can't use it. Why can't we download maps. Had to switch to Google maps. 1star as still not resolved. Grrrr. Ok so when can we download maps?
Excellent Navigation APP. I like ot better than Google Maps. I like the speeding notification and I particularly like the speed/Red light notification features.
I am an Uber driver. It was good before but now in my daily use experience it has become slow and lagging.
"Comparing to Google maps: Pros: Actual police stands and incidents, Speed limits (in Slovakia), Fuel prices. Cons: Battery drain, No traffic density info (color lines), Ads on stops, User interface not so intuitive, No small map when in background."
The route guidance is very good and my favourite of any gps app. Con: the experience in Android Auto is shocking. Missing a lot of functionality but worst of all is search. Google will perfectly understand your voice prompt and pass the full address to Waze and Waze has no idea. It will only give you some street options. On my phone I can select the 'Google' tab in search which allows you to work around Waze's terrible search but this isn't offered on AA.
"Cool and useful app, only suggesting to make a small change while in AA - top status bar background is too light so the information (white text) is difficult to see."
I think this app is very good because they let you know where everything's at and who's going to wear and then I'll let you know the speed limits before you get there so I think it's good
On my way to New York and I keep getting an error message. It's like the waze is not recognizing the address I'm going to in New York. It's like it does exist on the map. It's not my phone because my wife is having the same problem. I even updated the app. I guess I have to settle for Google maps.
Its good for small vehicals...but for trucks n lorries we have to use it..sometimes we truckers stucked in small route..so hopefully update the features for trucks.tq
How do I get the app from pinging every time it wants to award me points? I don't want points. It's there a version for grown-ups?
"Unable to use during peak traffic hour. If there is option for 0 star or negative, I will rate it. Everytime were out of connection during peak traffic hour."
"Unusable. Doesn't seem to recognize any sort of networks. Register button also doesn't work, but that might be caused by a network restriction. Edit: I went out of my way to gather logcat of the issue, send it to the support while explaining what I'm providing, but all of that was not enough for them to understand and accept my report. They kept wanting my waze account name again and again, even though I can't create one without being able to connect to their API. Overall an awful experience."
Very bad. Its disappointing that waze doesn't work simultaneously on two devices like car media and a phon. This is the worst experience I had since waze was announced.
"Only used for a few days so far and seem reasonably good. The one thing I have noticed though, is the speedometer is very inconsistent with over speed alerts. The visual speed is displayed correctly and if going over that speed the visual changes to show this (good). But the sound alert when going overspeed is very random. I set the 'when to show speed alert' to 'speed limit' - it will work once, but further along the road it will not beep again until some minutes on. Also when driving into a new speed zone, the sound alert may or may not work. It's very random."
"This used to be a wonderful and unpretentious little app, but now (2022) they've ruined it completely, from design to functionality. Example: the built-in Waze voice recognition for dictation of addresses used to be flawless, now that they replaced it with Google Voice is completely UNUSABLE, it doesn't recognize anything. Example 2: the app disconnects from the network every 15 minutes, it's extremely annoying. Design has gone downhill too with lots pf idiotic, pointless, meaningless changes."
This is great app - when it is working! I have now had to load this app three times from scratch over the last few weeks. On each occasion I have had to add my favourites again which has become very tedious. The app crashed again this morning and is constantly saying it is initialising. As a consequence I am about to give up on it as it is not reliable which is essential for as a navigation app
"Quite the cute app, sometimes it goes nuts with the maps ‚òª like, the road is closed, but it insists that I should go that way ü§£ other than that, it's pretty cute .. hope there was an option to tell us when we go over the speed limit, more route options and less wrong roads ... like, if there was an option to manually update the road to: closed/ reopened/ not working .. and change the path so that other users won't have to go through that same wrong path again and again and again .... thank you"
"What is happening with the wase's app? I drive for Uber and enjoyed using the use of the Google map. But last two weeks. It is not working properly. I deleted the data, and cookies still have problems. I uninstall it and installed it and still have the same problems. I don't direct you, and it doesn't tell you the arriving time. It doesn't work anymore as it used to. I rely on wase as I has been such a brilliant app for someone like, but unfortunately, it doesn't work. I got a galaxy S10."
"Brilliant graphics and great app! but I really dislike the new (bold) font, when it goes back to the old font (or a setting that changes the font to the old one) it's definitely a 5 star app. also lately when opening the app it doesn't go straight to the map it firstly goes to the Waze app logo for a second and it's really annoying. PLEASE GET IT FIXED!"
"The map is fine, but something is wrong with the voice navigation. There are two voices, one talking politely but giving completely random, even dangerous, navigation instructions, and another one, talking more seldom and in a more casual tone but giving correct instructions. The problem is that at roundabouts the two voices overlap, giving different instructions, which is very confusing. We got lost because of this bug. Please fix it."
"The only reason I've not given this five stars is because it lacks one thing that Google Maps has - the 'five minutes slower', 'similar time' notification actually on the map. Sometimes Waze takes you down a different route that may only be a minute faster. On Google Maps I can see if a route is quicker or slower, and by how much, without having to open up different menu options."
"The app is greatly improved over the years. But there is still a ways to go, often GPS is lost, often it can give a confusing instruction like stay to the right when it is a 90¬∞ turn. also it gives instructions so far ahead that one can often be confused. But this app is much better then the Google maps app, more accurate and precise"
It is better than Google maps at avoiding traffic but still very weak routing algorithm compared to non free apps. You will still stuck in traffic for no reason when there are empty roads next to you. Moreover intersections on highways are very badly illustrated and very difficult to know where to go sometimes. For a free app is perfect but far off professional grade ones.
"I used to adore waze, now I've given up on it. it reacts far too slowly, so i am already past a turn before it shows it. it no longer gives the best routes. if i restart it then it gives a new route similar to what google maps gave in the first place. i dont want to use Google maps but until waze returns to being reliable it's my only option. i miss waze. i like the traffic warnings and ability to add my own warnings. please fix this app! clearly I'm not the only one suffering."
"Way more good than bad! Obviously, Waze not sharing/selling our data is a huge point in its favor (I'm not being naive, I just like to make things a bit more difficult for the giants). The social aspect of the app - having drivers report events - is very appealing to me as well. Sure, there are things to improve, mainly in the UI. I'd compare this to the Fairphone: you know you buy it out of awareness for what it stands. (things certainly are more complicated, but we can try)."
"Its very buggy these days. It loses connectivity sometimes, in crucial moments.There's often a delay with the next turn. It changes routes so quickly sometimes. For example: In the same minute it tells you to turn left, then right, then goes back to left. If sticking to the original route adds 2-3 minutes, then it shouldn't change routes. The flip flop decision is not worth it."
"Just got this because Google maps has been glitchy for weeks now. So far I love it, it's working perfectly, the maps are clear with easy to see icons. I like how they integrated the music player functionality. I haven't been able to see yet if it integrates with Android auto yet as my personal vehicle is in the shop, but hopefully it does. My only criticism is that there is no paid ad removal, but as of yet there have been no intrusive ads, if there are I will have to find a different app"
"It's ok, but I don't really see how it's any better than the directions given by Google maps. It takes me to small residential roads where there are school zones (30km/hr) just to save a max 2 mins on a 30 min trip. What's the point? I'd rather be stuck for 2 extra mins on a straight road than take 5 extra turns and go through a school zone."
"This app used to be great, but it simply doesn't work with Android Auto since the last couple updates. It will show blank screen in black or yellow once unplug and plug in. It will take super long time to calculate routes with spinning circle. Sometime even when phone is fully functionally with no reception issue, it will say no network and couldn't display distance and arrvial time. Disappointed that it took the developers a few updates and issues are still there."
"Years have passed, emails, reviews written but still no way of changing volume when connected to Android Auto (Ford Sync) also the green progress bar to indicate radar control still hasn't made its way to Android Auto. Worse, no way to always play via Bluetooth by imitating a phone call. Even Apple Maps has this feature. The most cynical part of it all? The code is there! Google Maps and Waze both had these features in the past."
Great app. I've only used it in the UK but it does everything that I need from a satnav app. Picks the fastest route avoiding traffic jams but gives you the option to choose other routes. Will reroute to avoid jams whilst you are driving. Shows your current speed and the speed limit. Also shows speed cameras with a warning noise if you are exceeding the speed limit. Very clear maps and voice instructions.
its very cute and looks nice. Very nice option to point out what is going on on your route with two tap. But this is where it stops for me. Major fail when i connect it to my car to have it on my car's display. Everything stops if my phone is locked. Not the automatic lock. i know there is an option to prevent that. But i don't see the reason why my phone should be unlocked while i drive. if anyone has a fix for that let me know. I would consider trying it again.
"Probably the best navigation app around. But has had it's issues. On one journey it got fixated on a closed road and didn't reroute despite numerous notifications to tell me about it as if it wanted me to change the route manually. On arriving at the closed road there was an amusing build up of Prius's, as Ubers had been sent the same way as I had. Occasionally it doesn't pull new traffic data for routing away from traffic and end up in long delays."
"This app used to be much better. Landscape mode is close to useless, the screen is eaten up by large text areas and it cannot be customized (hidden). Every update brings ""fancy"" functions however their value add is really questionable (useless). Instead such, it would be great to have a clean, light version. Autofocus definitely needs improvement also. Navigation sometimes advises unnecassary and nonsense detours, therefore I mostly use waze to check traffic - and not for navigation."
"As a Goggle Map user there's a few things that bugged me on this app: 1. The interface design is a mess. Personally I prefer a cleaner look on the screen rather than Waze clunky semi 3D design. I found it more confusing and distracting. 2. More simplicity. The screen was filled with small text that can pop up, causing me to be slightly distracted because I tried to read it. That's a very dangerous especially when I'm driving. Overall this is a decent app."
"Inaccurate and gets stuck when losing connection while in a tunnel. Other navigation system at least try to follow the route to keep you on track. Also the routes chosen are not ideal ones. Needs to learn better and shorter routes. Pity, as the rest of the app is really good."
"Good for warning you about cars on the side of the road and other hazards to be cautious of when driving. One annoying thing is that it only will warn you when the screen is on. Overall it's a pretty useful app to help everyone be a safer driver, especially in regards to if anyone of pulled over trying to change a car tire on the side of the road, it's helps you as a driver have a heads up to change lanes when possible, and generally to give them a wider berth!"
"Waze has lost it Waze! Sure it wasn't perfect at times, but now it's completely gone off the grid & for the longest time (over a month easily) without a resolution or even an attempt in sight. If the hardware manufacturers don't let you down the software developers will, then they'll blame each other leaving you frustrated & stranded. Planned obsolescence at it's finest!"
"It was good, used to be a fantastic app. Now though, it freezes constantly in my car ('17 Escape with Android Auto & Sync 3), it never retains the car settings, the speed indicator disappears, and display constantly zooms to the maximum. I've seen other similar complaints on other sites, I hope this gets fixed soon. It would be nice to have the old reliability back."
"Excellent navigation. Good path suggestions and real time updates thanks to other wazers. It'd be great to be able to set up music dimming (0-100%) because when instructions are frequent in town, music is constantly dimmed. Forced night mode is not available in Android Auto and temperature in ¬∞F when I have all in ¬∞C in phone and car. But it already saved me a lot of time. Having the choice between simpler way on main roads, instead of multiple turns in small streets where calculation fails."
The app has bug. Lose GPS signal all the time in Android 12. Can't be used because you will get lost or worse. I'll change my review after this bug be fixed.
"Pros: Does what it is supposed to do, and does it well. Map is clear and legible, with no large black boxes obscuring the view (take note, Sygic!). Integrates very well with Android Auto, no complaints there (and for free - take note again, Sygic!). Traffic alerts are nice feature, especially police hideouts and jam/obstacle warnings. Has dark/light/auto modes. Cons: Can be stubborn sometimes in sticking to its preferred route for miles, although it's obvious that the driver chose another route. Sound for some strange reason does not work (stuck on ""Preparing navigation voice: 0%"" without ever doing anything, no matter the system/Google assistant/app setting). The app ducks the audio from other sources when info or warning is ready, but out comes nothing but silence."
"Took me down the wrong direction on a highway service drive, right into traffic. Also once told me to go the wrong way down a residential one way street. Never had this issue with google maps."
I find waze works pretty good. However when tapping other users *beep* and *message* are greyed out
I use to love this app but now every time my vehicle stops an ad pops up and won't go away when I start moving so I can't cotrol spotify unless I reload the app. If I even park somewhere I can't dismiss the ad.
"Friends can be only FB friends? Why do you need my network's data? Ah, to sell to vendors. Speed camera notifications disappeared, only icons on map. Shall the driver keep looking the phone while driving for icons? Very safe :) Actual speed: varies constantly while using tempomat. Direction changes are indicated far too late.. I already changee the road when receive notification to do so. Maps gives these days far more accurate time projections. Summary: super start, bad current state."
"Warnings don't go away while using Android Auto. Other than that, I love this app."
For some reason when Waze is up on my phone it's in dark mode but when I switch it in Android auto to dark mode while I'm on my phone it does not work and when it's on Android auto it's only in light mode for some reason it will not switch I have no idea why it keeps doing this but when the app is just on my phone it's in dark mode but as soon as I plug it in to Android auto it will not switch to dark mode and I do not understand why please help!!!!!!!!
Really is a great app but please make the GUI better on Android head units as at the moment its awful with too much of the screen taken up with horizontal boxes when not in navigation mode
"the extra features are cool like managing spotify and showing your speed and showing alerts. But it does a p!ss poor job of it core function , which is to navigate you to your destination. It takes me an average 30% longer than if I would have used google maps, or it takes you to the wrong place. Will NEVER use it again to take me to a place I dont know"
Not working properly on Android Auto. Massage would stay on until click on it.
Notifications do not refresh with new ones occuring throughout the route. Fix this
"Better that Google Maps, interface not nearly as nice as Sygic. Why I cannot see the sky above the horizon in 3D mode? It is esthetically much more pleasing. The remaining problems are: - too complicated menu when you drive, warnings hidden to deep. I would take top 4 (speed trap, cops, constructions and accident) and have them as a screen icons OR just under the orange circle. This is CRITICAL.So much clicking WHEN DRIVING!!!! - the traffic congestion is different in Waze and Google Maps- why???? Should be the same - the weirdest one. When I ask about gas stations, it gives me often the stations that are 200km away and not the nearest ones. Google Maps shows all the stations correctly. VERY ANNOYING - some speed traps give audible sounds others not. I cannot watch the screen when I drive so please, LOUDER sound and on EVERY speed trap - aesthetically it would be nice to lower the horizon so one can a see a bit of sky at the top of the screen :):):) - and the final one, the developers never answer....."
I like using maps to get around but someone showed me waze and I'm in love it's like a fun way to get around away to figure out let's me know when there is any issues on the road plus if I am over the speed limit definitely 5 stars üåü 5stars !!!!
"A million times better than Google maps! Love all the extra features and the voices to choose from are hilarious! Love the interface as well, very cute üòç"
"Was good, but currently not working 100% on Android. Points are not changing / updating."
"Very practical app when driving around places you are not familiar with. it's maps are quite explicit and clear. Voices of the guides are always clear. sometimes there are things you would like to learn how to do, but u cant. fixing bugs is not really easy. i totally recommend this app."
"Love this app but it still requires some work. As my main means of getting around, this app is missing quite a few features in Android Auto. I use this for work and drive at least 1000 miles per week using it. Lately this app has been very unstable, crashinh for no reason while driving or reporting something. Also, there is absolutely no way to share my drive from Android auto. You can only share from the phone and connect to the car after. Bit of a nonsense if you ask me. Could be much better."
Unfortunately lately the routes given by Waze are taking me on routes that get me to destination later than the routes previously provided. What's the point of sending me on a route that gets me to destination later than other routes? Slowly this is dying and other maps apps appear to be much better in determining the best and fastest route to arrive to desired destination.
I've always used Waze but recently you've put me into a dangerous situation. I was in an area I didn't know with fast moving traffic then all of a sudden the map goes black and I get an advert filling the screen instead with no way to get it back to normal. Even after I restarted the app you were persistent you wanted me to divert my route to some restaurant. I had to switch to Google maps instead to see where I was going. Everything in the app was responsive apart from the map.
"Worse than Google maps, does update live data. You would get stuck into bumper to bumper traffic and it will show there is no traffic. . . Useless"
Hey I really would like to give it five stars but lately it's been restarting while in route and I'm trying to figure out why the phone is up to date just curious as to how to fix it cuz I love this app and I want to give it five stars but it's not acting right hope there is a way to fix it thank you.
"Excellent driving navigation app, only downside does not have charging point information to charge my electric car"
A great app that saves me lots of speeding tickets and turnings. However I have been having an unpleasant experience on the freeways. The app keeps changing routes and I'm forced to miss my turns and exits. It's a sad experience. This started happening after the update. I'd love to see it fixed soonest.
"As many have said, once the BEST app for getting you somewhere on time and avoiding delays in traffic. The app is now massively buggy and bordering on unusable. Estimated distances to turns etc are erratic an unreliable, you have to read the actual street names if they are any visible. It also consistently opens the last location pin received instead of one you have just opened. If the app is minimised or there is a loss of network coverage..you have to verify that the route is still correct"
"Use it daily. Edit: after feedback below, I followed instructions to request a fix for low ping volume when speeding, and suggest a larger/fullscreen speedometer/speed limit option. I saw many closely similar suggestions from at least as far back as 2016, so seems developers aren't paying attention to this at all. I even see the audio volume issue as a bug as it fails to alert a driver when speeding - unacceptable. Changed my rating down to 1 star based on the unresponsiveness re these issues."
"IR seems like it helps to give a bit more accurate shortest routes, shorter time routes to your destination in a way even though it's not perfect yet, you can't fully zoom out to see whole world, but can search bit better. Just quickly turn on roaming, load your map and turn off data or wifi knowing from reviews it helps a bit, but sometimes it just shows black/white screen and won't load map still. When middle of forest type of area for hiking, this map has hard time detecting GPS."
"Very useful, use it everyday. Just small issue on my Samsung galaxy note 9 where gps will fail to connect when there is full service and location services are turned on. Also it seems to be playing catch up lately, it will be late on some directions and when they are missed it will take those precious seconds and minutes sometimes to re route and when it does it slows down quickly"
"Used to be my favorite navigation app. But now no longer lets me log in with my Google account, my phone number, or my email address. It also bugs out all the time and closes unexpectedly the app that used to be the best has become worthless"
"Best traffic and navigation app... but only recently it's begun to freeze.. don't know why ? I keep restarting my phone, sometimes that works... I hope that the Waze team can sort this out ..."
Wase turned some of my travels into horrible experiences. So many messed up routes because of this app.
I love waze. Have to acknowledge that while you can select electric car as avatar the app itself does not show charging stations as a category only gas stations. I am not sure what the point of selecting Electric as your car is in this app.
"Well, I downloaded this because I'm trying to distance myself from Google anything; I don't like being spied on and targeted. Much to my chagrin, Google assistant popped up in the app. I'm trying to remove it. It's bad enough to have to get apps from Google Play. Ready to switch to an iPhone..."
Excellent app to hv. Notification is a big help.
"why do my announcement voices change mid sentence? the woman's voice speaks very slowly, and then speeds up."
"I have used this app for years, I recommended it to so many others. Since the latest update, the routes are wrong and despite my choosing the best, it keeps trying to reroute me to its original choice. It has made me go around in circles 3 times lately, and I can no longer trust it. Yesterday it made me turn off an expressway, go through 3 suburbs with local speed limits and heaps of turns, only to have me rejoin the expressway 3 km down the route. Wasted lots of time."
"Hazardous App! This used to be a great app, but it has been loaded with too much advertising and is a road hazard. When you need to see the map, it will be blocked by advertising. Too bad the developers are making too much money on the ads to consider offering an ad free premium version. They're going to need that money when somebody has an accident and sues them."
"Used to be OK, but the devs are not responding to user problems and are unwilling to fix even crashes. E.g. the app crashes whenever car mode is activated (a NATIVE ANDROID FEATURE) and bugs about the issue are closed and flagged as ""invalid"". Also they don't pay attention to landscape mode at all, which many users prefer. Navigation often tries to go on much more complex and longer route for 1-2 minutes gain for a 30min drive which in the end turns out to be slower in reality, and then very slow to recognize a much simpler, faster and shorter route even when we go that way instead of what the app wants... Quality seems to degrade over time instead of increasing."
"A good navigation app. But have some room for further improvements. 1) The live navigating panel should display the ADDRESS of the ""destination"", on the blank unused space at the top of the screen, and perhaps also display the ""distance to"" destination too, in real time navigation. 2) The audio announcement at reaching destination should inform the user whether the destination is on the ""Left"" or ""Right"" side, just as the Google Maps App does."
"Since last week, my waze ETA in motorcycling mode is permanently set to 4 mins, regardless of whether the destination is the next road, or the other end of the country. In car mode it still provides correct calculations but in motorcycling mode (the only one I use) it always returns an erroneous time. I can't find any info online about this (only about slight inaccuracies rather than an entirely missing calculation) and am therefore leaving 1 star in the hope it is picked up by developers. I have cleared cache, uninstalled etc etc. Help."
"Before the latest update works fantastic. Now search bar/google and my waze bar takes almost half of my screen in horizontal mode ( which is how I exclusively use it ) with no way of hiding/removing them. In addition, can't figure out how to make where you're heading always on the top like before. Where in heading is always from side to side. Update: Removed & re-installed app fixed heading issue. But the 2 bars that block almost half the map in horizontal mode are still present."
"The best GPS app I tried ever. usually I use it on my car vertical android screen, and the experience would be better if I'd can change the speedometer position. Now the speedometer is on the left bottom of the screen, and I need to down my eyes to see that. if there would was option to change it to left upper position, would be perfect to me. Thanks!"
"Don't know what's going on but the app has become pretty unstable in the last couple of months. Crashes randomly while driving once a day, forcing me to start fiddling with my phone. This never happened in the past and I can't imagine my OnePlus 6 can't handle it... Moving to another app underlying issues get resolved."
"I hate that in order to use waze, I have to use Google Maps. It is so annoying"
"Always 20 metres or so behind where I actually am which makes some junctions and roads with many off shoots difficult to navigate. (GPS, high accuracy location, etc. is enabled.) Loses sight of my calendar after a day or two of telling it to look at my calendar - rather frustrating to have to keep setting that up. That said, I do trust the routes it takes me."
I have used this app for a few years now. The friends feature is rather broken for me now. my wife has the app but despite us both being in each others contacts the app has no idea. i have no other friends either despite then being contacts lol. It can also go a bit loopy when signal is lost and needs to be closed and reopened. Recently it has started to find new routes just before exits. The persistent speed limit sign is very handy and if it wasn't for this i would be back on Google maps.
"I use Waze on a daily basis and I enjoyed using it. After the last update, with Android Auto it loses the GPS connection continuously. I can't navigate with it anymore. It takes more than 20 sec to get the connection back after losing it and it last 5 sec, then lost connection again and a blue dot shows up and so on and so forth. Today I discovered a workaround that is insane. I have to start a navigation with Google Maps alongside with Waze and then it keeps the connection up. FIX IT ASAP!!"
"Waze is probably a good app if you want a pre-planned route. But it will not allow the user to modify routes to suit individual preferences. This is unfortunate because the advantage Waze offers above Google Maps is that it relies on users to contribute current info for others to follow. Had I been able to add more than a single stop to a route, this would have been a good app for my purposes. Thus, I can only offer two stars for the app. I will not be using the app again."
"Used to be great, good for police locations, but it freezes and crashes in Australia all the time, i have used for years, and drove 16,000km across the USA, didn't crash then, but in Australia before i left and after i guy back it will randomly freeze all the time. Cleared the cache, uninstalled, still does. Crashes all the time, never rely on this app!!!!!! Ever!!!!"
"A few issues stop me giving 5 stars. Other than the problems I mention this is a brilliant tool that I use all day and don't intend on changing. 1: I have screen burn from speed limit signs. 2: Integrated music player/controller will refuse to work from time to time. 3: Freezes when used with Android auto and SYNC on ford systems. (Unsure if issue is with you or Google) 4. Audio selection (On, alerts and off) will not ""pop up"" to intended place. Instead it sits near the bottom. Please fix!"
Fills me with rage every day. Its meant for driving (hands free) so why do I have to press at least 3 buttons to start navigating!? Search results by voice suck so you need to type in a search instead. Can't choose routes easily. Basically it's not easy to use whilst driving which is it's main purpose. Why can't they just add all the useful functions to maps and be done with this terrible piece of software. Can't rate journeys either so if it takes you a rubbish route then no way of it learning.
"I was going to submit a report via Waze itself but even that process is questionable. Where to start? Don't use this if you don't know where you're going - for some reason the actual place you want to go is return dead last in the results list and doesn't actually mean where you want to go. The app launches in day view even at night and takes a good 5 or more seconds to switch to dark mode, blinding you in the process. Recent update has killed the overview function. I've run out of room to whinge"
"This used to be an awesome app. The last 4 trips the routing has been utterly useless telling me to turn in one direction when my destination is in the other direction. Now it just told me to turn left in 100 metres and when I got to the intersection in told me to turn right in 100 meters, nearly causing an accident. It told me this 6 times evan 250 meters after I turned. It is now totally unusable. Will not use again until you tell me you have fixed the routing algorithm. Extremely frustratin"
"Would of given 5 stars in the past but lately it's been freezing and saying NO GPS signal, so I have to pull up and restart my whole phone! Also I've noticed it hasn't been taking me the quickest routes lately, seems to be throwing me into the deepest possible traffic it can find. Normally prefer to use over Google maps but I've had no choice but to start using them instead. Hopefully you guys sort out the bugs and give us an update soon. Ps. Should compensate us with some free score points lol"
"Love this app, but when using thru Android Auto I can't see what destination has been selected. After looking at a number of destinations then starting the car, it's not obvious what destination is the active destination. Hopefully the destination will show in an update. Also, if during a trip you search a food chain for example to add a stop, the food chain's various locations show with addresses, but it doesn't say which is closest. You need to know the area to know which to choose as closest."
"Fed up with the constant crashes, cleared my cache, cleared all data, reinstalled. Crashes at least 3 times on a 4 hour journey, requiring resubmission of route destination, which of course shouldn't be done while driving... Rarely resumes the route after a crash. Crashes appear to be related to route recalculation, bit it's been like this for years now so only 1 start from me"
"The app was great when I initially installed it. Then after driving a certain distance and being promoted from a ""baby wazer"", ads begin popping up. Very annoying and dangerous for a navigation app. Unfortunately, there's no way to get rid of them since there is no pro or paid version."
"I used to like Waze, but I don't know why it's error like ""No network connection"", the navigation is very very slow, and when i'm driving the navigation doesn't move at all! It's ridiculous how waze try to find my way back to home but its just sending me to somewhere and its starting ""no network connection"" that the navigation doesn't work at all!"
"The app itself is useful, easy to use. But it some times decides to stop working while I was driving. And then it couldn't find my starting point and then it couldn't connect to the system. I had to uninstall and install back, reset my connection, flight mode on and off. Come on la."
"Great app ! 90% of the time it works flawlessly but since about 2-3 months ago it started glitching ... the car/arrow goes sideways into buildings & stuff instead of following the set route, few times it's been very laggy in the middle of roundabouts and intersections and other times the route makes no sense at all according to the road signs (it points you tu turn in the middle of the intersection where it's forbidden to do that)."
"The app was working fine for almost 2 years with my Samsung S10 with Android 10 but now android 11 paired with a Ford sync 3, then all of a sudden, no on screen speedlimit, no driving icon, and it tracks slowly. But after turning it on and off several times and using""maps"", without any issues, , it will then decide to maybe work. I am not sure what Waze changed, but change it back Also tried multiple reboots and calibrating gps in maps, download the gps test and it shows alot of satellites,"
"I hate the new interface with the ""My Waze"" at the bottom and also how it pops up with your favourites and past navigations. Many times I have Waze open without navigation so I can see my speed and other information. Bring back the old interface that showed a full screen map with a magnifying glass bottom left to open up the navigation blade... Also when you do start navigation the overview pops back up again with start drive button again for no reason."
"I used to love this application, now I am looking for alternatives. My problems are: - a ton of ads added recently which even affect navigation. The app is great so I would pay for ad free version. - Annoying pop-up comes in every minute about adding my vignettes despite I already added it.. - Recently I get a lot of 'Error calculating route' errors.."
"As much as I am upset with it, I would like to come up with a fair review: 1. The app is fun. It makes driving become more fun. I love the batman narrator. 2. Sadly this app is poor in navigation. The estimated arrival time is inaccurate 90% of the time. 3. The most problematic part is I can't read the route with ease compare to Google Maps. For countless time, I drove to the wrong route which end up late arrival. Come on Google, you can rectify this. Please impose the practicality from Google Maps to Waze. 5 stars for the fun user interface.1 stars for the practicality. My two cents."
It's been a very up/down experience with this app. Mostly works okay but one thing that really needs to be fixed is making a road closed option easy to find as a hazard. I got stuck in a two hour traffic jam the other day because a road was closed with other Waze users ahead of me in the queue. I tried to log it but could not find an option for this.
"Sometimes good, often bad navigation. Handles diversions from making a wrong turn extremely poorly. Example, yesterday we were taken on an unnecessary 3 mile trip on the way to a destination that passed a point that was less than 200 metres from where we started in the opposite direction on a 2 way road, with a roundabout we could have used to go directly there. Very poor. Going back to Google maps."
"Updating my review again. 1 star for being practically useless the past few days. It takes forever to find the network/gps/ calculate route. Meanwhile, Google maps is able to do all this in less than 5 seconds. Edit: it started to work a little better for a while. But as of today Waze could not connect to gps for the past 4 days. Even restarting my phone could not fix it like it used to. It's only barely usable as it can still somehow show my location as I drive along the route."
"I like the app as much as I like the IDEA behind it, however I have three criticisms: 1. You can't report road closures through Android Auto! You have to use the phone, which defeats the point of Android Auto. 2. You have to be NEAR the closed road to report it. Not always convenient if you're driving and you don't have time to stop. 3. Whereas in Google maps you CAN search and view the surrounding area map, in Waze you can't (you have to choose ""Go"" and let it calculate a route.)"
"I wanted to thank this great application as it's with sadness that I'll to stop using it, after soo much hassle and frustration I decided to look for an alternative, so far Google Maps seems to be doing great, I'll miss Kate n her marvelous english accent n having the option to report, but the frustration of not having reception, not getting GPS or the same old tired UI that is slow to help u find the right thing to report, all these things that weren't there a few years back. Miss old Waze!!!"
I think this app is great! I love that there are navigation voices to choose from and that there are live updates on road conditions. I'd like to suggest having a HUD function though! Also I think functions on the app could be clearer? It's a mess to try and change or add stops sometimes. Might also be nice to have the projected costs of erp haha
"It used to work great. Clear app, it shows speeds limit and driving speed, communicated events on the way. When GPS signal is good. But some how since October, this GPS signal does not work anymore properly anymore. (Seems fine on Google maps.). Uninstalling and re install did not help either. I can not trust information to arrive anymore ahead of events. App resets itself 3 time ms in 40 mins drive and positioning can be updated 3-4 times in that interval"
"I used to really like this app, ditching all Garmin etc. devices. But I wonder what happened in the couple of last months? Waze keeps crashing without apparent reason (during a routine trips, or outright after starting the app), has problems with route calculation or declares that it cannot connect to the network. Displaying ads when stopped in a traffic jam instead of more useful information is adding insult to injury. These days I am one step from uninstalling Waze."
"I am driving on the motorbike around the city. So i choose the destination, plug my earphones, turn off the screen and drive. Some times it works perfect, but now my phone just keeps shutting the app. I changed the power manager option for waze. No help. And app is going off silently.On long trip its very frustrating when you miss your turn. So have to step back to Google maps... unfortunately. Never used Waze with ""screen on"" so can't say anything about. For my way of use Waze is now useless."
"Used to be amazing but doesn't find my GPS location properly anymore, not even when I'm standing still. If it does, I need to wait 10+ minutes while standing still and then it still often loses the signal while driving. EDIT 6/4/2020: Kept the app for it's ""Tell me to leave"" but doesn't work anymore either. I cannot insert a starting point other than ""your location"". It wants to have location access all the time. Not going to happen."
I see very few advantages compared to Google Maps. Furthermore it can happen that Waze just doesn't propose the fastest route. I had several times the case where I choose an another route and it resulted in a closer ETA. Also Waze just removed a feature (voice recognition in non English speaking countries) without warning the users and without actually remove the feature icon. A shame.
"Good at navigating a single route, but light on features eg. It doesn't do multi-destination, like Google Maps. This is a huge miss for anything other than casual use. The app is quite likely to take you down a dirt road & even sometimes down city centre bus lanes User experience isn't great because (ironically) navigating around the app is very poor Overall, disappointing"
"It's the best GPS around, but I find I'm having to delete the app every couple weeks and then reinstall because the map ends up being blacked out and cannot see where I am going. This seems to be happening more and more often. I then reinstall it and it's back to normal, until it bugs out again.. Any reason for this? I've tried the various options that is mentioned on various help sites, but nothing really helps other then starting again."
A great app with a couple of very basic and obvious flaws. 1. The app doesn't offer Optimum Route So it sometimes takes you through tiny roads with horrible humps and hazards just to save a minute or two. 2. The app displays your speed rather than the speed limit of the road you're on! This is the most bizarre feature! I've been driving and riding for almost 30 years and haven't come across a motor vehicle without a speedo. So why show the speed that is already there instead of the speed limit!
"Last few weeks estimated time has been off by ten minutes or more per trip. I get the occasional delay due to accidents, but it's just about everyday twice a day. Without an accurate arrival time, what's the point?"
"Whatever changes you made in the recent update has broken a working app. Although it gives a route it won't provide turn by turn instructions and hangs at the initial screen. It just says ""proceed to suggested route"". It can't find GPS and approximates my location with a blue dot well off my route. It is useless in its current form and will force me to use something else. FIX THIS PLEASE!"
"Works like a dream... most of the time, more often lately though it says check my connection. Even though I've got 4 bars of 4G signal? Giving me no choice but to use Google maps. Usually when i need it most to avoid rush hour traffic jams. Frustrating, used to be great, but it's just good... when it works. Tried airplane mode for 10 seconds, tried turning my phone off & on again. Same problem keeps happening."
"I want to pay for a version without ads. The ads are ridiculous. I'm trying to drive, bro"
"Waze is essentially a better, more complete version of Google maps specifically for driving (no walking, bussing, et cetra). My favorite features include the speed limit warning, red light camera warning, and, above all else... the Police Reporting. If you live in an urban area this functions even better. When you see an officer doing radar/laser report it to help out potential-victims and fellow wazers. If you drive by a report where there is no officer, just suggest it be deleted. The app is very intuitive and there are many features. In fact, there are so many features it may be confusing at first, but you should definitely stick with it as the app is awesome once you get to know it."
"This was decent when i first stared using this but as with all free apps, ads destroy it. Apart from the regular crashing (even when I'm not using the app) I've had ads appear at the most inopportune times, such as navigating a busy and major roundabout and then being asked for a coffee from the local coffee shop covering the essential directions, or asking you of you want to change the icon for the vehicle. Both distracting you from safely driving and is a nuisance. Shame..."
"Half the time the reroute ends up being even longer than sitting in the traffic that I would have stayed in. Very wonky, wish there was the ability to select a hybrid route to mix highway and back roads."
Who the hell designed this stupid app? I put in an address and it's giving me an advertisement instead of tak8ng me to where I want to go. Not to mention half the screen being taken up unnecessarily. This apps quality decreases with each update.
"Use to be a 5 star app, but now no longer works with Android auto. The app just freezes and can never find your location. Which makes it essentially useless."
Whole screen basically freezes on an ad and doesn't let u access music search bar or to swipe away ads Fix this pls make it better then I'll give 5 stars. But yeah new update super buggy Fix this bug
"Accurate information and journey times - have never arrived after the estimated arrival time. Its way better than Google maps, but the information on speed cameras means it's illegal in most countries."
"I didn't allow to use toll roads on my trips but when I entered the address of my destination, it automatically selected the toll road, how come? I have to manually go into alternative routes and select the one doesn't uses toll."
App having issues gets stuck after notifying of speed camera gets stuck on that notification and stops giving new ones
"Good for seeing hazards and speed cameras, but unfortunately absolutely abysmal at finding a sensible route between A and B. It will add an extra hour onto a 3 hour journey with its weird insistence on convoluted routes. On the motorway recently it wanted me to come off at every service station and drive thru the car park before rejoining the road. It's lost the plot!"
"This used to be an excellent app. Been using it for years. Recently it continuously gives an error message that ""something went wrong "" and that it is ""unable to connect "". I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app but the problem persists. This is highly frustrating as it is practically impossible to use the app for navigation. Please fix the bug."
"For Malaysia,...Waze nowadays are useless in finding shortcut route at all. Like yesterday....route leading to my place...choose a 21min 14km instead of 21min 12km....In town, obviously jammed on waze route...have to force it to use the shortcut by bypass Waze route..and only then Waze update it to that shortcut....This is bad....travelling longer,jammed and fuel....Comeon, upgrade the Alogrithm for goodness sake."
Horrible experience on multiple occasions. Diverting to single lane country lanes adding 5+ miles to save 2 minutes which aren't saved at all! Absolutely rubbish experience!
Great app you get all the alerts when you planning the trip and get alternative routes
Absolutely horrible. Do not download. They will play ads while you are driving. It's incredibly dangerous and almost caused a car accident!
Not finding GPS on car. Android auto. Worked perfect for a long time now nothing
The latest update doesn't work right for me. Going to look for a new navigation app
"Overall pretty good. Interface a bit tedious - could make controls and options more easily accessible. Instructions and map movement a bit slow - easy to miss a turn. Google maps reacts faster. Navigation would be much improved if you had an option to quickly see the next direction instruction, rather than waiting for it to come up. Also very annoying that during navigation the map is rigidly fixed in the current direction of travel, rather than leading into the upcoming direction."
Great app! Very useful. Waze has become my default navigation app. Love it.
"when navigating, the route is hard to see, especially the junctions. the screen is cluttered with information squares that obscure the navigation itself. black squares? why they are, you can make translucent information inscriptions. When I approach the junction (crossroad), this part of the route can be increased so that it is clear where and where to turn. It is desirable to make the map on the entire screen of the smartphone when it is in the HORIZONTAL position. Thank you."
That app constantly changes your route no matter what you choose. Very annoying to find that you're on a different road than you specifically selected.
"Waze is not working anymore with recent update of Android Auto. This version of Waze is not responding, I see only blank screen. Google Maps is working fine."
"Will be better if app will offer few directions at the same time, not on separate menu, No perfect counting shortest or fastest way. Have to work of it. However WAZE one of the best for TAXI drivers app with TAXI settings."
"(using Android auto) Until recently, it was perfect, 5 stars. Best interface yet. Two other improvement could be unique to this app, chimes instead of voice indications for turns (just add a new voice), and last minute chime on upcoming hazard or police. The warnings come to much in advance. Perhaps if the app determined an estimation of the time to the event instead of the distance... Yes. I'm a programmer."
"Calculated routes are awful, especially compared to Google Maps. No offline maps. The app can only add ONE stop on your trip, and then you can't customize your trip anymore. It has problems when starting trip and turning around properly. The app design is ugly and outdated. The UI is confusing and counterintuitive. Editor is horrible and lvl 1 can't do much on his own, only via bothering people on forums. Traffic reports are its only upside, but they can't be reported from remote location."
"Used this app for a couple of years, it's been really good. Now it stops part way through a journey I have tried to restart the app but I get a blank screen and a message saying the app will not start. I have uninstalled the app, restarted my phone and reinstall the app, now the app will not load looks like back to Google Maps."
"There is an option to avoid gravel roads, it does not work. this app had me on a freaky narrow gravel road for over an hour between Hamilton and Thames"
"I used to using Waze while I driving Grab. Today suddenly Waze totally lost connection while I driving on halfway, I totally get lost, within few hours Waze got no connection and It couldn't open it normally. it's really bring me big troublesome. üò†üò†üò†üò†"
"Working well again now, the issues since my previous review have been fixed. I am however now experiencing a new intermittent issue with the UK ""Kate"" voice. Sometimes she says ""exeeet"" instead of exit, she often pronounces ""destination"" with a French accent, and sometimes one of the other voices suddenly takes over from her mid sentence - not sure which other voice it is but it's another female voice and it still has Street names. I think Kate is feeling a bit under the weather! ü§£"
The waze app is the best navigation map has everything for me to get anywhere l go riding or walking üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üëç
"Please, let me get rid of ""Where to"" and ""My Waze"" bars from the map screen!!!! I use Waze in landscape mode and these 2 totally useless bars take almost half of the screen. Ask for the changes 8 months ago. Nothing's changed. Is it really so difficult to make these bars configurable? Show/Hidden setting? Guess, not. It seem like Waze just don't care. Too bad... Update: I asked there as at least a dozen others did! BTW Search bar doesn't go away in landscape mode when driving - fix it!"
"I will give t star ,because only this app help me to reach location to my company on joining day. All other maps shows wrong place and appreciate. Please change the position of current speed on the road from left to right, its difficult to view during driving"
"The android auto version is trash. Searching for something is horrendous, its like searching for an address on an excel spreadsheet. On top of that it locks the list if it thinks you are scrolling too fastü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. So many restrictions too. Now the reports are restricted to a certain speed, so if you are going too fast all you see are yellow dots lol nice. Heck you cant even zoom the map if your moving. No thanks."
Won't show on Android Auto unless I start and programme it before connecting. Black screen otherwise. Often locks up going around corners a real problem when navigating roundabouts as screen stops updating just when you need to see which exit to take. Flaky routing. I know it's 'dynamic' but shouldn't mean I get a route to and a route from a destination that are the same EVERY time I go there. Why is there no option in hazard notification screen that a road is closed? Voice control US outside US
"Waze was great, but now just keeps telling me and my wife no network available, even with mobile data on.have Uninstalled and reinstalled but no change .other GPS maps work fine. Samsung s6 and s9."
Good navigation. But unfortunately doesn't work with Audible App. When you are listening to an audiobook while using Waze you don't have audio guidance. It stops in the middle of the sentence and you can't hear where you have to go. It's definitely a problem with Waze because with Google Maps everything works fine
I've used this for years on several different android phones. Ok for short trips but always crashes after an hour or so on longer trips. Even worse is that the screen freezes - so you're often unaware that it isn't working and I have missed a turn! No such problem with google maps and Waze seems more stable on iPhones.
Love the app and the ability to pinpoint and add traffic cautions! Only a few downsides. Waze DRAINS my battery far faster than Google Maps. The GPS location is also not as accurate compared to Google Maps. Sometimes it will think I'm in the opposite side of the road and tell me to turn left when I should turn right.
"This navigation app is the worst of the worst ever. Used to be very good, but now all it does is bring you to the longest route with the longest duration. Totally not worth your wifi or internet data to download this app. Just go for another navigation app out there. Could not recognise an easier route for a destination, instead showed a lengthy old and abandoned route. Stay away from this app. Recommendation: ZERO!"
"Laggy. Either sound direction gets cut in the middle or random re-routing that pops up and then cancels itself. It's a pity you can't personalize the alerts (on turns, cameras, etc) to pop up at the distance of your choice instead of the 1/4 mile intervals. The app isn't evolving and to be honest it seems it's going backwards, same basic app that is has a rising amount of bugs and glitches."
"If you can't solve the black screen on Android Auto, then you should go back to SDL."
"I like the social aspects of this app, those reports are invalueable. The problem is in landscape mode the map is covered by huge bars and boxes. The waze suggestion box is full with people being angry about it, but the devs are ignoring them. As a navigation app it's also not my favorite, I have to keep it on silent, it's too verbose and it's route planning interface is hard to use."
The new update made this app very frustrating to use. The Search bar and My Waze bar takes up too much space. When reading complains all you get from Waze reps is that the bar goes away after a few seconds. IT DOESN'T!!!!! It stays on the screen and takes up 1/3 of it making the map too small to use the app for navigation. It does go away after inputting a destination but who does that all the time..
"For some reason as of recently I keep losing connection with this app, and once connection is lost it seems to have problems reconnecting. I never used to have any problems but for over a week now for me it's been very glitchey. I try other sat nav apps to see if it's my phone or Internet connection but all the other apps I try seem to work fine. Really is a shame because for many years this has been my go to app."
"Its a really user friendly and interactive app. Simply best in all ways versus Google maps except one most important element of every single purpose of a GPS navigational app it greatly needs to improve on is its routing. It has already happened to me more times than i would've love to avoid it especially when im in a mad rush for time, it takes me on a detour only for me to realise another turn earlier i would've reach the same point minus the unnecessary traffic lights and extra distance."
"Talks way too long about every turn... Then it randomly doesn't say anything and you outright miss the turn. No difficult left turns? Yep. The option is on but it gives at least one every single trip. I've timed trips using Waze against Google Maps going to routine locations. Every. Single. Time. Waze is the slower route. Every time. Then, there are the ads that block half the navigation screen as you have a turn approaching. Missed turn yet again. Worst navigation app I have ever used."
"I've experienced an issue with Lyft when attempting select Waze for navigation. When selected, Waze's Play Store page is opened even if Waze is already installed. Running Android 13 on a Pixel 5a. Any idea on what the problem could be?"
"How is an official Google App this buggy like why?? I cant even connect to my account on because ""no internet detected"" error message, but when I use a guest account it works just fine, like where is internet relevant in all of this ? You lost me on this one."
Waze was working fine before I did an android auto update. Now it doesn't want to start up anymore. I have reinstalled waze on my phone but no luck. Was 5 stars before. Now it's back to 1 I guess.
"Hate how maps tell me my destination is in 1000 feet. My tape measure isn't that long! Also when on multi- lane street , tell me which side of street! 3 lanes and it's a craps shoot to be in the correct lane to turn."
"Love how Waze keeps up to date with things like construction and accidents, but unfortunately it became useless for me when I had to start planning multi-stop trips for work."
"It gives good directions for 90% of the trip. The last step is always wrong recently. My destination will be on the right for example, but it will tell me to turn left."
"Phone restart issue. Crashes after 10 minutes and phone restarts automatically. Useless app now, such a shame as it used to be great."
Not available on Android Automotive. Please add it as soon as possible! Edit: thank for the response. But I'm talking about android AUTOMOTIVE and not Android Auto which they are completely different things.
"This was my favourite navigation app, but I believe since the latest update it won't update the GPS location and is basically unusable on Android Auto, very disappointed."
Really disappointed the app sends me to places I don't want to go in a direction that is not convenient simply because it's taking me to where I wants me to spend money along my route what good is your app if it doesn't function to what your consumer wants so now I choose not to use it
This app used to be awesome now it sucks üòî Crash all the time or won't even open? I've uninstalled it & redownloaded multiple time. Still won't work. Sad. Bit I guess this is what happens when you sell out to Goggle
Really confusing interface. Why can't I plan a route in advance from a different start point than my current location? And why can I preview the route?
"Can't sign up, can't login, can't register account. While operating in ""guest mode"" can't add waypoint to current trip. ""0 stars"""
Recent update causes GPS to freeze and only updates location about once per minute or two. Have gone back to using Google Maps because it actually works.
Waze was working great. I then had to update it.. now the gps locks up & i keep have to re put in my destination.. it will gps my location & then lock up again. It is now completely useless. Have to switch to google.
Feels like a kindergarten coloring book. It seems to have good navigation however I can't get past the childish interface.
"Wasted time. I used waze to get of Atherton + go to Cardwell but waze decided to take me around Atherton in a circle, past the road sign to Cardwell and then tried to take me to Cairns, in the opposite direction. 45 mins wasted so I changed back to Google maps, to get me where I need to be. I also past 2 cop's without a waze warning but it did warn me on the way back, after the cop's had already left. Such a shame. Worse than Google maps and they're pretty bad."
App is basically unusable. Keep trying to update but still doesn't work. Keeps freezing and not following the route
"Completely inaccurate travel times. Absolute worst app for directions. So close, yet so absolutely terrible."
The damn map wouldn't load at even after updating while I was driving and trying to use waze for directions to an appointment. Had to switch to Google maps
Over a decade long user. New phone. Account completely wiped. Support says just build a new account. Will I stay or go...hard to say. I will definitely be exploring other apps this week.
I like the app alot and being able to choose a different icon for your vehicle is pretty cool. Wish that it would do a timeline to be able to see where gone in past
There is no showing the map all around the world if i want to find a specific place or city. Because the map just has set it up 3000 m. Distance to provide info
The navigation part of waze is fine for me. But it lacks some useful features: Car profiles. Which car has what toll passes.
It's been unusable in the last few months. The gps location never updates it just spins in circles.. if I open google maps it works fine
"Great app, annoying when it suddenly changes the route, putting you through difficult situations in traffic."
"Very good for a free app, told me there was a broken down vehicle on a busy road coming up, and there it was, glad of the heads up. Also, Arnie is cool."
"It was buggy at first but it has settled down now. A shame the map UI is so unappealing to look at. Make it pretty for 5 Stars. (Galaxy S10 5G, Android 12)."
"I like waze, however I wish it gave you the ability to notify you of directions sooner. Im literally on top of turning when it says turn here. Thats not very helpful"
"It does not have 100% accuracy, and the interface loves to crash. Erase all Oracle Java, all Python3>, and all .Net3>. C? C++? Much better."
"Mates, I can't change fuel type anywhere. It's gone from every menu. Sometimes I'm not driving a diesel car and need to find a quick fill-up... ü•∫ Major UX oversight!"
"It's a good app, would be nice if it could remember shorter ways to an address, instead of taking you a longer way around - but way better than others for sure üëçüèº"
"Use to love waze but the ads are getting ridiculous and it now finds the route that takes you to their advertisers not the fastest route. Truly sad, use to be my favorite."
Need to fix the search function. Didn't realize it was taking me to a hotel 3 hours out of the way. Might wana make the search actually search along the preset route
What have you done waze just upgraded to the z fold 4 and trying to log in with my Google account and constantly getting the no connection error popping up I have connection sort it out
"Terrible app always looses gps and freezes on map, even with full reception it sucks don't waste your time with this app."
Unable to use this app after the recent update. Unable to connect to GPS/ crash suddenly. Please look into this
It is a great navigation app. It detects more and better stuff on traffic than Google maps. Trust me this app is worth it
A great app. I use it all the time. It finds the fastest routes to your destination and keeps you informed along the way.
Does not show live traffic...more of an offline map...depending upon the traffic the route color should change.
Its bad..everytime open the app..no gps..even reinstall still same.. please fix it..its not first time...hundred time..
Don't use this shity navigation.... just put me in traffic.... where road is closed.... terrible Avoid!!!!!
"Beats TomTom anytime! This free to use Sat Nav is fantastic, it will only get better with more users. Personally I would like to have the option to add things to it, ie Heavy Rain Excessive Surface Water etc. Also a quick button to add road closure, or accident on other side of road. Little tweaks , but thats a personal taste, but I love it."
"On short routes it lets go by side roads helping avoid heavy traffic and save time. Though it has problems with routes and locations search. Sometimes (on long routes almost always) the app reports route server timeout. Recently I searched nearby address and Waze returned two results for it: the one is 8 km and the other is 5 km away. On the map both results are at the same point, which is expected cause it is the same address. The last version also crashes"
"Waze was so accurate moving the navigation bar in the app with the vehicle movement. And now, the movement is delayed. For example, I've already taken a left/right turn and moved few yards but the navigation bar in the app is still taking the turn. Similar happens with the roundabouts, I've already moved forward but the app is still on the roundabout. This use to happen with Google Maps and now with Waze. It's difficult sometimes when the driver has to take immediate turns and at roundabouts."
It was a great app. But after integration with google voice typing(in the right corner of search line) it became much slower with annoying pauses and google sounds. Also I can't turn it off. I choose this app when it was different in all details and solutions from google navigation. Now they have same voice typing. Using Google satellite images is the next step?
"Can't get Waze to play audio to car stereo interrupting radio. This worked perfectly on my old Windows phone. And I believe iOS (for at least Google Maps) has option to ""play as bluetooth phone call"". This function needs to be added and I will increase stars (and use). Also found OsmAnd and Sygic have bluetooth phone call option so is possible on Android."
"It's fine and did everything it said it did, I only have one very RAGE inducing complaint though, you can't save more than one favorites location saved. If you already have favourite a location and want to add another you found along the way for later, it is EXTREMELY Difficult to do so Also, the time shown on the app is very much wrong and doesn't follow local time"
"Things I like, it's completely free, I can help with making it better, other Wazer's tell me things like hazards, policemen traps, has GPS speed and speed limits (sometimes wrong, but I can get them fixed). Works on both android auto & apple car play, can be set to night mode, but you have to really search for that feature. I can help with making the map/app better. We use it all the time. I don't notice the amount of internet it uses, it can not be very much."
"The app is great! The problem are the ads during the route. Sometimes, I take the wrong street because an add just pop up when I need to look the map. This is quite dangerous too. I know they need to make money, but the way they do really affects the quality of the service. Sorry for criticizing so much."
"Appreciated that if the team could take a look on the application bugs. Waze is my best companion when I'm driving. On 10 May, I'm using waze as usual for my driving. However, the direction wasn't correct. It lead me to the opposite way of my destination. Say for example, the way I suppose to go, road board refer me to the right. However, waze refer me to the left."
"Update. Latest version of Android Auto allows easy selection of waze or goggle Maps on the cars infotainment system. once you've selected waze in Android auto you can't return to using Google maps unless you delete waze, crazy, someone I use one sometimes the other. Also impossible to place my work location in the right place, in the right road but I can't move the marker. Google maps for me."
"The app works very good but has some room for improvement, would like to have a quick access to the next gas station or how far is it, while driving you can not distract your eyes from the road much, now in the app you have to do about 5 touches in order to select and try to understand the app on where is the next gas station, confusing while driving to be honest, a single tap to select the next gas station will help a lot! more focus on the road!"
"The app will randomly close if I turn off my screen, not all ways but enough for it to be a problem. Aside from that it's great, it's routes are better than Google maps (at least this is true a while ago) because Waze will give directions based on traffic on the 401 collectors and express where Google maps will go with a longer route because it has fewer changes"
"Every single time I enter an address to navigate to, the map disappears and is all black. Upon further investigation, it looks like this issue has been happening since 2017, and has still not been fixed. Can't trust this app at work. Going back to Google Maps. Other than that, it has awesome potential. Using Samsung Galaxy A31."
"This is more than a map system. It allows for the immediate notification of traffic jams, accidents. Police speed traps. Potholes, broken down vehicles animals in the road. Debris. anything that'll make your drive even more infuriating. You can find alternative routes with it. You can find petrol stations, restaurants and other food outlets. I use it six days a week and i can plan my rest stops. The only downside is you cannot plan more than 2 stops. it would be 5stars if it had that capability"
"Having used this app for navigation for the last few years, I've noticed the app just getting worse and worse. If you need to find an exact address, do not use Waze. If you need to be focused on the road and don't enjoy pop up advertisements at every set of lights, dont use Waze. If you want to be rerouted on a 10 minute detour to avoid 30 secs of traffic, use Waze Edit. Having reviewed the developers sub par response to their now secondary map app to firstly advertising platform. üëéüëé"
"It's a great app for navigation and combined with the user-updated traffic, you'll never be (very) late again. Why 3 stars? The last update just ruined the landscape mode, I can't see anything on my screen anymore due to two large nav/search-bars and the odometer stays in the middle of the screen together with the vehicle information button."
"Horrible app lately... every time my phone is connected to Bluetooth stereo in the car it loads up then shuts down after a few seconds. I've uninstalled a few times, cleared the cache and data. My jeep doesn't have audio auto and it connects to my phone via Bluetooth. Even at home at times it shuts down. I've been using this app for years with no issues"
"Laggy, slow and frustrating. I like the concept of this app: being able to know about real time updates, like the traffic and if a car is stopped on the road. But I've had way too many issues with the map being behind and getting lost because it's giving me slow directions. It's frustrating and I don't trust it anymore. Back to Google Maps for me. Sorry team."
"Waze used to be the best app. However since a few weeks i don't know what happened, but the routes are terrible. A 15 minute trip is 30 mins or more now because waze takes a touristic route. I have seen parts of my city that I have never seen before. And I don't like it! I removed the app...if you somehow fix it i consider to install it again, but for now i am done."
"This app used to be the best one 'on the market, but it's gone from hero to zero. For some reason Waze seems to think that no one should make a journey lasting more than 2 hours, and it shuts down with no warning. I recently found myself driving in the middle of nowhere, at night, with a sat nav that suddenly switched off and left me to guess where to go next"
"Keeps shutting down on me, I ride a bike so the cel is in my pocket with the screen off, but after a couple of minutes I start riding and after a couple of directions the app shut down by itself and I have to pull over to start it again. App has all permissions granted (battery, mobile data, GPS, etc) but it keeps shutting down If it didn't stopped it would be an easy 5 stars for them, but no. Tech support doesn't answers."
"The first time i used Waze was around 2 years ago and it led me to a random and dead end route. So Disappointed. Second time I used it was today and it was horrible. Calculate the fastest route but it was the longest route to the destination. A 30 minute estimated driving becomes 2.5 hours of driving. Google map is so much better compared to Waze. The only thing that is good about Waze was the notifications but, not the route options. Still dissapointed with this app after 2 years."
"EDIT: in the latest version, Waze GPS localization is now better (if keeping the phone power saving OFF). There still some moments where the localization lags behind but the app is now usable. Please keep improving it, some features are great. Also, please add the option to flag a forced deviation on the road (due to roadworks), at the moment I can flag either roadworks or map errors, but a forced deviation is different and worth flagging to other users to save their time. Thanks"
I am giving 3 stars based on my experience this evening. The traffic in my city was particularly bad as there were incidents on the two stretch of motorways leading out of the city. I chose a route by a small road that I am familiar that may help bypass the congestion but the app led me to go by another route which I was unfamiliar but knew that it would also lead me to my next destination. I was misled as the congestion on the suggested route was far worse. I managed to work my way back to the route that I was familiar with and the traffic flow was much better. So this app had left me confused. Can I trust it for future road traffic situations?
"I'm not happy with the routes the app takes, some of the routes are dangerous and bumpy, the app should give u an option to choose routes instead of giving you one route when you take a trip and it's recalculating time it's too slow you end being lost ""speaking from experience"" I think that should be updated. And that route option is compulsory it should be added. I am happy though with the app..."
"The last update is just nonsense. The map is completely unusable if you are not navigating anywhere and you just want to see surroundings, closeby traffic and streets in unfamiliar places. The map is unzoomed, car icon is small and at the centre of the screen, has a pointless search bar covering 1/3 of the screen, and it is now impossible to see the next street even if you have a huge phone. I could stand the other problems but this really just does it for me. App goes to the bin soon."
"This will be awesome once you iron out some bugs. My setup seems to forget where it's going if I loose signal and certainly if I disconnect the phone (road-side service stop) Interesting that your Google Maps suggested alternative routes to avoid traffic, yet Waze remained silent. It also appears that the reaction time between seeing something and logging it is too short, resulting in objects being flagged past their actual location. 09/10/2018: Still forgets where it's going when engine is stopped. Think petrol station, rest stop etc..."
Waze gives strange alternative route suggestions without giving a reason why. Government has a low tolerance for distracted driving here. This app is unfortunately dangerous. It distracts the driver while driving by repeatedly presenting multiple alternate destinations that are really ads ex. fast food etc. I've had six in a row crossing one overpass before. It also encourages illegal device interaction while driving.
"Won't work with Android Auto. Seat Leon (2017)-Galaxy S10+. Works fine when the phone screen is on but once it's off, Waze is all over the shop! Shame, really like the live alerts where drivers can contribute, or the speed projected on the screen, far superior to Google maps... but it does not work reliably, like Google maps! Wasted opportunity, shame. If Waze fixes the app on Android Auto, it will be great, lots of people have complained though but Waze does not seem to care so far."
"Much better than Google maps. Was sick of getting lost with Google but I've tried this Waze several times and you get a much simpler easier ride. I think some of the Uber drivers use it. Took me a much better way avoiding a lot of traffic. I like that you can set a time and location and it will alert you when to set off. Only thing is it does give you a lot of alerts while driving which seems a bit dangerous. Speed cameras, roadworks, places to eat etc. Could be distracting but you can disable."
Waze used to be by far the best navigational app available on Android but whatever update they have pushed out has destroyed it. The refresh rate has become terrible and has made me miss junctions on lots of occasions now. The car regularly jumps on and off roads and is wrong nearly every time you look at it now. If this is fixed I will bump it back up to where it should be.
"I needed third party software Android Auto to allow the voice instructions to play through my Audi MMI system car speakers. This app in my opinion is super and superior to others which I have tried. Having resolved the voice instruction issue, it is comprehensive and easy to use. It redirects my route based on traffic or roadworks. Poi's and speed camera notifications very good. Highly recommend."
"I loved this app, and used it on my phone regularly. I then began using Android Auto, and the experence was awful. It kept freezing, I could only access half the features, and eventually made my Android Auto crash and freeze whenever I opened it - even after reinstalling both Waze and Android Auto. Sad, because it is a brilliant app... when it works..."
"will not connect to spotify no matter what I try. Directions in my use have also been inaccurate, slow and it's less reliable at finding addresses in the first place than other mapping services. Idea behind it is good and useful but not worth the downsides, especially considering a lot of the reporting functions are being added to google maps anyway."
"Waze is excellent for routing and as a sat nav can't be faulted. But one thing is EXTREMELY ANNOYING. You can set up alerts for speed, accidents, police etc but the audible alert volume is so low you don't hear them. You can turn the volume up but then the voice directions are far too loud. If alerts were louder and possibility to have different sounds for different alerts this would be greatest app ever"
"This app has lost it's shine. Full of bugs. Doesn't show estimate time of arrival(ETA), so I reinstall the app. After reinstalling it, ""sign-up later"" button does not work. Reinstalled the app 3 times and still facing the issue. Also having connection issues at time when my internet is perfectly fine and fast (tested by running high resolution YouTube videos). I moving back to Google maps if its not resolve fast and it continues to introduce new and serious bugs."
"It was slightly better before google took over, but it's still one of the best navigation apps out there"
Good app however does have a rather annoying fault. I use this app on a daily basis and I can't fault the Police/Speed camera updates and the user update screen is easy to use but it does crash a lot and normally and the most inconvenient time. Today it crashed twice during a three hour journey and by crashing I mean the program ends so you have to restart and then re-enter you destination admittedly you can do it from the memory but still very annoying. Like any navigation app it is very battery hungry so always use while charging.
"App is always unreliable with GPS signal and connecting to Internet. Google Maps has no issue picking up my network and GPS even if I only turn it on after opening the app. Whereas Waze refuses to connect and when it does, the GPS reading is always inaccurate that I have to restart it. This issue appears at least 3 times a week for me. I'd give it zero stars if possible. Nothing worse than an unreliable navigation app that doesn't work when you need it most."
"Used to be good, but now it's so slow it takes ages to do anything, places ads over map WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING, if the volume's set at the wrong level you have to pull over and go through 2 screens of settings to change it even though less necessary audio options are available on 1st audio settings screen. I closed my app a week ago on a drive once I got to a route I knew and it now won't update my location, so sets routes starting 10 miles away. Help centre wouldn't load, nor submit error."
"Amazing. I love it when it say ""be careful, police ahead"" or something like that."
"This app has gone crazy! It continually announces distance travelled and average times etc. even when it is turned off. I have erased it several times but the problem persists. I have turned it off, turned off sound, turned off notices etc and the problem cannot be overridden. I can't find a solution on line so goodbye Waze. Too bad, I really liked it but the announcements go off and very inconvenient times."
"I like this apps a lot. The map was easy to follow and the traffic information was superb. But this past few months, the apps need longer time to load, searching for network and GPS. Sometimes it take longer to search for routes or unable to search routes. When try to reload the apps it freeze. What happen? You need to fix this issue."
You need an account to use this app. I can't create an account with my Google email. Why do you need an account at all...?
"Great alternative to google maps. A few upgrades should be considered like when you stop the route and want to explore where things are you have to exit the app and go back in. There is no review function for places. There is no option to pay and get rid of the advertising, though the advertising is not very intrusive. Overall a great nav. app thank you for all involved."
You have asked for my location 6 times while setting up & I have it set yes when using the app! Obviously that's not good enough for Google because you won't set up a reminder unless I allow location all the time! Bye I'd rather use a paper map then put up with this+ you're time is as bad as Google's! And you just don't get it! Some people are retired and they are home & the app can't comprehend this! Bad app uninstalled! So why can't I remove permissions & password?
"Nice navigation, seems to pick the faster route compared to google maps. One thing is missing - a post-drive summary where you can also update hazards on the road instead of trying to manage it mid-drive somehow without breaking the law. Best to use this app with larger screens to reduce driver distractions. Add the post drive summary and I'd give 4 stars!"
"Simple & Effective. Easy to use, quick to open and start navigating. No subscription & non- invasive ads which only pop up when vehicle is stationary and quickly disappears again. I've been wanting to support app with subscription or buying version but sadly only free version available which happens to be superior to most paid for apps."
"i enjoyed this app, superior to Google maps in most ways. stability of waze is terrible at the moment, it tends to crash mid journey which is devistating as it is distracting and uncorrectable. if you can't fix the stability issues at least gracefully recover ie automatically using something like a watchdog timer that replots the last route. i have had to leave this app until i feel it is trustworthy"
"Very buggy, particularly when used with Android Auto. It often can't keep a GPS location for you when driving. Each time I reinstall to try and fix it, there's the rigmarole of entering a mobile number and getting the code. It always has problems recovering accounts and I now must have 4 email addresses registered as the account recovery never works. This means my saved locations get lost every time. I also lose whatever points etc etc that I have gained between each reinstall. A frustrating app."
Absolutely love the app but over the last couple weeks it's been freezing mid drive
"Theoretically it should be brilliant. But it constantly says cannot cannot calculate route, the guidance always lags behind so you end up missing turnings and a lot of the time it just gets hugely confused and stops working mid route. Stick with gmaps, it's more reliable although fair enough without the bells and whistles Waze has."
"I tried this app 2x while out of town for work; would not recommend! The routes were not accurate and directed me into a parking lot and then a bus terminal. I would actually arrive 10-15 mins later than Waze's ETA. I was also surprised as well as distracted by all of the ads that would pop up and cover the screen, hiding my route for what felt like 2 minutes and way too frequently. I'm surprised that a navigation app would have so many ads and allow said ads to cover up the route."
There used to be an option to cancel the audio directions but you removed it for some weird reason that is unknown to me. Now I am forced to listen to the voice directions. I tried to lower the audio fully in settings which is the only thing I can do about that but it's still muting my music every time its supposed to give a direction. Give us the option back and let us decide for ourselves.
"I have used this for years, but it's now on the downgrade. Now you MUST broadcast your location publicly to be able to report incidents. Sorry, I dont want to do that. Surely this will result in a major decrease in crowdsourced data - Waze's key strength? Also, the map view has become very cluttered with information bars you can't get rid of."
"Great app, use it more than Google Maps due to the current speed/speed limit indicators when connected to an Android Auto head unit. User interface while unique could do with a modern refresh. Biggest gripe at the moment is that the when navigating with Waze connected to Mazda CX-9 Android Auto, and Waze is in the background, the physical navigation button in my car brings up the car navigation software on the screen instead of Waze. When navigating with Google maps this works well."
Really good app comes in handy especially having to traveling to Nashville and back every day
Great app for map directions and it's better then Good Maps since Waze tells if there are Speed traps
Useful but plz add the minimize to a small app when I go back to work on another app like what we have i n google maps
I love the app. But for some reason it doesn't calculate the correct amount of traffic on 485 in Charlotte
"Hey, would like to know why Waze requires screen to be on on phone while using this app on android auto? How this app can be used in Android auto ?"
Good until it kept trying to take me through the parkway in a commercial vehicle.
For some reason it gives me navigation in two different voices.
Not good in Landscape mode...1/3 of the screen is obscured...
"Love the app, hate the mixed voices. 2 stars until this is fixed"
Love this app instead of Goggle maps it tell you how fast your going& side of up coming approach/cops/ect.
Speed cameras stopped showing on Android Auto as well as the radius speed camera alerts
Unable to display properly on my car andriod player. Hope can fix this
For some reason sometimes it takes you in the wrong direction and makes you go in circles you should fix that
For god's sake ! What's wrong eith you people ? How about adding 3D buildings to the map ? That's the only thing you haven't done so far. Why won't you get ahead of yourselves already ? Shame on you !!
Can you fix the damn voice issue that changes voices mid sentence.
"Better directions, camera detection and app stability than google maps"
Great application. Really fun and so correct about warnings.
Keep closed when launch.alreqdy unisntall and install..still have same issue.
"Keeps change my language,bit annoying when I get warnings."
Multiple voices and alerts are not going away.
Gone back to maps Don't need adds popping up while driving some place
Great experience especially coming from a Retired Military. Great
It's a good app. More route options would be great.
Its really good and get you short say and it let's you skip traffic
Taking two stars off because Waze stopped working on my Xtron Android head unit. üòñ
If you are interested in taking confusing directions AND enjoy when companies SOLICIT DRUGS at many intersectons then WAZE IS FOR YOU!!
Best GPS directions app. Also very informative.lets you know about broken down cars speed cameras and cops.
"What a pile of suck. It won't work indoors so I can't plan my trip beforehand. It takes an age to fire up. I've had it installed for a couple of weeks and it hasn't successfully started to navigate the first time I tried ONCE, making me having to resort to Maps. Wow! I didn't think anything was worse than Google Maps but, no! Congratulations, waze! You accomplished it!"
"Despite having location information On, the app shows the alert ""no GPS - showing approximate location"". This problem is been for weeks now."
Great app but would benefit from being able to indicate towing a caravan for route determining.
"This app is better than Google maps in when it comes to finding other routes when a road is blocked. The cons of this app is that it takes you through many shortcuts which are more time wasting than time taking the common route. Google maps is better at calculating distances and routes, cons of Google maps is that it's not always updating current road blocks."
"My exact problem. No audio warning sometimes. If I wasn't looking at the screen I wouldn't know. In the last few weeks, however, some drivers relying on Waze for navigation have spotted continuously increasing inconsistency especially in terms of police reports and speed traps. A discussion on the Waze forums includes more information about the whole thing, with users explaining they‚Äôre no longer getting any alert when approaching the location where a speed trap has previously been reported."
"Very poorly constructed, directions does not follow thru."
"Lately, alerts don't close when you go by. Speed cameras, level crossing, construction, etc... remains on the screen until drive is finished."
Its a good and useful app as compared to the google maps. But it has a one very very bigger lack in this app....it just show the route from our location to destination. If we want to calculate the distance from other location to one another location than we have to use google maps. It does not show other location distance.
"Newest update just wiped everything.... Address book, Achievemens, Settings, the lot! (Using local account)"
"Great except: when used in Android auto it declares there is no network for the 1st 10 mins of every journey. Even though I'm streaming radio at the time. For the whole trip, the app keeps resetting its part of the display. Sometimes crashing completely. Music podcasts or radio uninterrupted so it's specific to waze. Galaxy s9p merc command system latest software in both cases."
"Tried it for the first time today. Freezing and not working on 2 devices, nice"
"as both waze & gmaps are owned by Google i hope they are sharing each other's base traffic & maps data for the benefit of everyone. besides that, it should only be a preference of interface & unique features. i find waze interface has bugs and isn't well-done enough with a vehicle driver in mind. gmaps has some faults too, but not as severe as waze. the waze notification is a useless ""running. tap to open"" text. keyboard stays open when switching back to waze. route change notif obscures navi."
"Very dissapointed, Waze suddenly goes out of the app after some time while navigating and after sharing a drive with others it also just stops sharing after some time so the whole trip cannot be viewed the whole trip, you have to keep sending new share drive invites - it is SO annoying. And even after escalating the issue, nothing was done, the ticket was just closed with no resolution!!! Will definitely be looking for a more reliable navigation app!!!"
"When out on a motorcycle, sometimes I don't have a destination. Sometimes I do but want to take the scenic route along the coast rather than the highway. I need an app that lets me select the roads. This doesn't provide that from what I could tell. Also, being in my home I was surprised to see the app had me on a nearby road. Looks the the app has a snap-to-road feature built in that is a bit too strong."
"Used to love this app but it's slowly going downhill! Things popping up distracting you when you are driving, taking ages to load and reroute, never updates for closures and when you are driving and want to quickly change the voice commands when you have no chance to pull over its like 3-4 different options distracting you from driving. Also typing in addresses it can take a while to load which never used to be the case. Then you are driving and adds pop up blocking your view. Getting worse"
"It doesn't even matter if this app gives you decent routes at this point- it's incessant pop-up ads telling you to go to starbucks, Mcdonalds or any other myriad of fast food places are down right dangerous. These banners pop down from the top, block your view of your route, and facilitates distracted driving because you a) are drawn to look at it and b) you have to touch the screen to get rid of it- especially annoying if you are coming up to your turn and have to scramble to swipe the screen."
Android Auto: The +/- icon for zoom in/out sometimes just disappers and can't be shown using the BMW iDrive wheel or even touching the UI. Instead I have to pinch the display while driving! I think this happens when the current speed + speed limit are both shown. I want it to be always present or at least give me the option to.
"Since two months, there's an issue in connecting waze to Audi MMI (Q7 2018) via Android Auto. It gets disconnected every now and then, with a yellow screen on the phone. I need to unplug the phone from USB, stop waze manually, restart it again, which does not guarantee that the problem will not be repeated because it does. I have bought a new data cable but the issue persists. When I do not activate waze when connected to the car screen, there's no issue at all. When's the next update???"
This app is great but there is just one flaw but it could be a major one. Please admin team incorporate the feature that tells which lane to choose while turning right or left just like google maps. i.e. turn right from the second from the left lane etc. Because sometime just aftet turning you gotta turn to opposite side. And this could be a huge problem if you are in wrong lane. So if you know it beforehand would be great.
"What's the possibility of including the following features? When you add a stop the ETA shown is only for that 1st stop - can't the ETA for the final destination also be shown (in parentheses maybe)? Also, I find that we can't go back to a location to report an incident after we've passed there. Very impractical. Can't just stop in the middle of traffic just so that we can report the incident at the correct location. Would be good to go back to the location once we've found a safe place to stop"
"Used to be a great navigation app. Now it seems like it drives your through more crowded routes on purpose. Sometimes I choose to ignore the route it recommends and after following a different route, the arrival time drops by 5-10 minutes. A short while ago I actually took the route it recommended an wound up losing about 20-25 minutes at 2 different railway crossings (the route I usually took didn't have any railway crossing). I will probably avoid using the app until better news."
"Great for directions esp when delay causes a reroute. But I'd prefer larger speed limit info. I like how it turns red if you go over limit. I'd like to see larger ""exit number"" in the centre of roundabout detail and for it to be positioned in top right corner (not top left ) at least for uk drivers. Also I'd prefer a better menu and more easily accessible so I can change destination or to add a stop or amend route eg via a shop. A laybys or parking pull in en route marker would also be useful."
"It's a good app. However, it recently took me into congestion charge zones in London despite having ""avoid tolls"" ticked, now i have an ¬£80 fine. Waze could definitely make it clearer when you're about to go on a tolled road. Also, when using Waze with Android Auto, I've noticed it doesn't always display what number exit I need to take on a roundabout. Sometimes it does, other times it doesn't. Also the font to display that number is tiny!"
"Great app, hope the community grows larger in Egypt, i find it more helpful than other maps applications i used"
I like the alerts and being able to share your drive with others.
Shows a list on Android Auto of search instead of the map locations. And can't share location on Android Auto .
Really like the app but like JTN what's up with Jane scary one minute Normal the next! Don't like it
"Needs couple of things changing. Needs the UK distance settings to say 'min' and 'mil', not 'min'/mi as the the latter is easily confused with miles and minutes, often at a glance (which is all you can do when driving) it's easy to mix the up. Also needs the icons to more accurate. For example, when you are coming up to an A road/motorway that splits, it often shows it as a turn, rather than simply getting in one lane or the other, a similar issue when a road bears left or right! DANGEROUS!"
With the latest update notifications in Android Auto do not auto clear.
Lately the alert stuck on screen not receiving alert afterwards on Android Auto.
I absolutely love Waze!!!! Especially the police detected ahead part on the map üòÇ
"Invaluable, but need a measured meter stick of the roads to judge distances"
I have used waze for a while. Recently I have started with a data package and use waze every day now. The last update moved the next turn panel next to the menu bar. Unfortunately when used with Android Auto which works in landscape mode this panel covers over half of the screen and the map is very hard to see. When in landscape mode this panel needs to be under the menu and not to the right.
Excellent travel app! Very traffic informative! A must have app!
I really like it but would prefer to pay a bit and not have ads
I love the DJ voice. It's hilarious. I get a good laugh when I use it.
It has been a life saver when I am driving to new places. I find it to be very accurate.
Easy for trip with family and when emergency waze can find the short way to go so fast
The new waze voice is very depressing. How can I take it off.
Search in this app is a complete joke. Years later it is still completely useless.
"Really fu—Åked it up with the female voice, didn't you."
Jumping like headless chicken. Here to there while you still in same place
Best Navigation ever ...it's save My life !!!!
"I thought its just me until I read all the recent reviews only to realise its a global issue. Waze used to be good. Nowadays its taking too long to calculate. It doesn't work indoors and when I am out stopping at the roadside, it takes forever to load and always give error. I had to restart a few times. Wasting my time."
"Waze, It is a great App, show the way to my destination. The App need a bit of improvement, it still not stable at times, easily disturb my other reception and can not function well, redirect wrong location, when come to location it does not show whether is on the left or right of the road, and slow on directions arrow pointing, mean poor in actual or specific location. Appreciate so much for your creation to help us enjoy our driving. Have a great day ahead! Thank you."
"UNRELIABLE. Keeps telling me ""No network connection"" when Google Maps and even YouTube works just fine on the same network at the same time* üôÑ. I've uninstalled the app now and will use Google Maps from now on. *The apps weren't running simultaneously. I ran them one at a time, and Waze was the only one that couldn't find the network for whatever reason."
Took me directly where I needed to go and actually showed me a better route than I typically take! Good program!
Every thing is fine. Just one issue. It couldn't rotate automatically while using android auto. I couldn't find the option to change.
"Best navigation app at the moment. However, it's not perfect: when you drive through a longer tunnel and you lose GPS signal, it will not update the speed and distance. Since my car's navigation still works, I assume waze could have an algorithm that estimates the speed based on the acceleration sensor and update the distance traveled."
"More and more I find myself being directed through unsafe areas. Please consider adding a report for routes that are not safe, or an option to avoid unsafe areas, because the app will try find the shortest route and then direct you through an area of town known for its high crime rate. I would rather pay a toll or travel an extra 10 minutes on a highway than run a serious risk of crime."
"I like the app, and have been using for quite a few years now travelling all over the UK & Europe. It would be good to be able to plan by excluding a road, say like the M25 without excluding all motorways. Personally I'd like a paid version to remove the adverts which can be annoying and distracting."
"This is not a quality navigation app. Being acquired by Google, doesn't make it better. Some routes planed with Waze are neither fast, nor short, especially in my country. One positive thing about this app is the function to get notifications on road events and police, but that is an unreliable feature as it sometimes just do not notify with voice, but only display icon on the map."
"For the last 2 months waze has been terrible, always shows error, keeps searching for network despite good line and data, route calculation takes forever, recalculation of routes only happens after we miss plenty of turns, doesn't show any traffic update, yet the developer doesn't seem to be doing anything about it even though it has been months. Will be switching back to Google maps as the main map GPS I guess."
"It was a great idea, but the editing side is dominated by high level power-crazy little Hitlers, who cause people to stop editing the map. Consequently, it is much less accurate than it once was. It is very much Google's less important navigation app anyway, Google Maps is the master project. Bottom line : use Google Maps."
"The phone version of waze is great, but the android auto version needs a lot of work. Many features that make the phone version so great are just not there. even adding a stop has just been added, but not to the same degree as the phone version. Also lane guidance would be a great addition. Overall a great app but the android auto version needs some attention."
"Have used a few times now in my car, in parallel with a built in sat nav ( 2012 SEAT). which is obviously not particularly live and a bit out of date. The warnings of hazards ahead works well and can get average road speed ahead based on other waze users. Has on a number of occasions given a better choice of route than the other satnav. areas for improvement are... not always easy to tell which direction on the carriageway has a problem. uses the phone battery significantly."
"Still no U turn. It takes you around a whole large block rather suggest to make a U turn when you pass an address it was programmed in. Will not recalculate the route even if you already passed 2 miles to another direction take a different route. Keep showing me to turn back, why? Can not be override auto or manual the calculation originally provided. This is the best they can do?"
I've switched over to Google map. Since the app doesn't even let me in due to connection issue while my phone connection is 100% fine. Not only that it kept disconnecting halfway through the journey which is VERY VERY frustrating. I feel its time to move on from the app. Its sad but its already been months and its still not fixed.
Used it mainly on android auto but after the last update of AA it seems they have dropped waze. :(
"Verify email, just send the code. Why does it open a webpage that doesn't work or says no connection in the app. Bye Bye, back to google maps I go."
"Not 100% sure but I have noticed that it consistently priorities those routes which present more adds, even if the route is rather difficult or busier with compared to all other available alternatives. FYI I have correct settings. Google maps provide better routes almost every single time in all conditions. I have compared it with Google maps & my personal daily experience."
"Edit - thanks for your response. Unfortunately the tinyurl link doesn't work. I sent a message via Facebook but have yet to have a response. This issue is present on both my phone and my car system, both are up to date. Thanks. Was working well until speed camera alerts stopped working - now audible speed camera alerts no longer work, I still get a banner across the bottom of the screen but no audible alert despite all settings saying I should get the alerts. I hope this gets fixed."
"Actually, I'm a heavy user of this social-based navigation apps. From several years ago. But during long holiday festive season (Eid Mubarak) here in Indonesia where people use to go driving long distance inter-city, I found so many mistake on route planning & failure to estimate the time of arrival (ETA). I know it's purely the dynamic data, but statistically the big-data apps supposed to be able to analize many dynamics on the route, start from early driving plan, right? Need improvement."
"Been stuck on the ""Just a Sec..."" for few days Sounds like many samsung/android user encounter the same issue since last update. Pls post the solution here so everyone can see it!!! Note. Been uninstall and reinstall and restart the phone many time."
"Decided to give Waze a try after having switched to Google maps for years and it was the worst experience ever. Going on a route that should take 4h in Austria it only shows me a very weird and long route that it says it would take 8 hours! Tried going from austria to Zurich Switzerland, same thing. 4h30 instead of the ""normal"" way of around 2h30. The weirdest thing is that on my wife's phone at the same time it seems to work. Maybe she has an older version of the app.. Shameful and bad support"
"The app itself is very good, especially for couriers and taxi drivers. My reason for 2 stars is because there is no way to use night mode or dark mode, the normal interface causes screen burns especially on Samsung high end phones. Anyone with OLEAD screens be very careful if using it for more than 4 to 8 hours a day 7 or 6 days a week, you will see screen burns!"
Waze does not work. Not reliable for directions.
Awesome but the feature of Road close should be back run into road diversion couldn't report it.
"I've been using waze for the longest time. I sometimes have to use Google Maps for specific streets that are not updated with Waze. BUT AFTER THE LATEST UPDATE, I CANNOT RELY ON WAZE ANYMORE. It can't connect to GPS anymore so it can't tell which side of the road I'm on. The routes loads in every turn. I am using 2 phones and it's the same on both phones. It makes me lose my way."
"It's a pretty good navigation app except a few things. You can't report things like roadkill on the other side of the road. You can't delete police reports from the other side of the road. Sometimes, when you don't have mobile data signal, when you report something, it just tried to send them to the server once and of it fails, it just removes the report instead of waiting for mobile signal and sending it then to the server."
"The app is really good and well designed. All the speed tracking, location etc. is accurate but the problems are with the account. Each time I save my details and reopen the app, all the details are erased except for phone number. Also due to this I can't become a map editor. Please provide a fix ASAP. Thanks."
"Was fab. But lately the traffic situation isn't updated fully, sending you down an unneeded diversion, showing huge traffic jams where there are none. Planning doesn't work and reroutes straight after route planning. And then there are the gimmicks (cat/dog thing) that even when you say no, it comes back. At this rate I'll be uninstalling for Google Maps, or even a TomTom app."
"Mostly navigates quite well Alerts are as accurate as expected given they are user based. However Waze is missing roads that have been there 150 years.... the town is marked on the map but the multiple sealed roads to it are not???? Also I repetitively input speed limits for over a year on roads that Waze doesn't have limits for but they never show up! I won't be wasting my time doing that anymore. Love the 2D map view with direction of travel always up, Something all gps do except Google...."
This navigational app is definitely one of the best and most helpul for drivers. Real-time updates of events in the route helps us adjust accordingly. The location tracking is quite accurate. The feature where it tells you to keep left/right because you have to turn later on in a more-than-one lane is very useful indeed.
Since the update before last the waze widget crashes everytime. I get the notice that Waze has stopped when trying to open te widget. It keep searching for connection while the Waze app has connection and shows me while driving. This is very irritating. I also sent feedback. I had hoped that the last update had fixed this but alas... Otherwise I love this app.
"App is quite buggy particularly with Android Auto. It's not as responsive as Google Maps, taking time to detect GPS signals and at times, not detecting them at all making the app itself appearing to crash. It's a real. shame.... Also suggest using contrasting colours to clearly help identify what options users are selecting in the Android Auto interface. Its difficult to known what you're selecting when using the cars menu selector - in my case, a commander controller knob."
"After recent update, Waze become more and more hard to load, it took forever to load"
"I'm very disappointed that ""Live"" has a 30 second delay. By the time you see the car, person, etc., in front of the property they're completely off of the neighborhood block. Not good for security purposes because they could also be looking thru your window or right at the door to surprise you when you go out to investigate."
"in 6km do... in 1km do. too much anticipation is actually useless. if you didn't hear clearly you start looking at the map in case there is something urgent and it is for +10 mins in the future. Google maps anticipates 300 or 200 m from the maneuver and on the spot. that's how it should be. language: my phone is in English, i like apps in English, Waze thinks that if I'm in a spanish speaking country, I must have the app in spanish, no, thanks. and the voice is awful. 3D and dark map look too bad"
It freezes in the middle of a commute and in attempting to update it through play store it says I cannot. WTH???
What had happened to Waze in the past few weeks? So glitchy! Won't clear notifications (pretty sure there are Zero railroad crossings in the middle of a major highway). Gets Hella confused when riding in the express lane from downtown Denver. Making some bizarre reroutes. Definitely not notifying you of road closures. Three separate accidents on Colorado blvd with the boulevard totally closed from two of them. No access to westbound 70 but that's how it sent me anyway.
"Too distracting! Ads popping up at stop lights, getting random prizes as you drive (and can't turn this off) makes this a dangerous distraction while driving. I hate Google maps but that's what I have to use, because this was awful and annoying. I don't need to collect virtual candy as I drive, I'm not playing video games like a ten year old!"
"So much bugs, I am using now petal maps and amigo..it works excellent"
"Waze is a great app to have on your phone. especially if you drive a lot. it has a spark of interest by adding little emojis and ""level up: emojis. the app itself is easy to use and can be read easily. It is very handy being able to report incidents on the road when stuck in traffic. I usually use Google maps but all that shows sometimes is red roads and you often think well why is it red. Waze has an option to suggest what has happened I.e a pothole or a crash etc. I recommend !"
"Was absolutely fantastic until Google bought it. Now, it gets the wrong destinations..like trying to route me to Brittania Rd in Brampton instead of in Mississauga. It will land you in traffic and not recalculate to reroute like pre-Goggle dates. If you don't check the route before following the instructions you could end up in the wrong place. When it works, it's great. Love the ability to warn and find out about police on the route."
"Absolute garbage. I tried this app a few years ago and it constantly tried to send me down roads that were closed so I reverted to Google Maps, which is far more reliable. A friend recently told me he gets on well with Waze so I tried it again, but it failed me conclusively the very first time I used it again. Even though a road was closed, with signage, and users had marked it on the map, it still insisted on trying to send me that way. Luckily Google Maps was able to find us a route out again"
"I'm not sure whether I need to blame on this upgrade but the GPS signal extraction issue comes back again when it is working with the Andriod Auto since the last several updates. The symptom is all the same as it previous looked like which loses the route track on the map. I have to switch to Google map and it works good for getting the GPS signal. I cleared all the buffers, memory but didn't work."
Literally does not work I can't even get passed pressing 'ok' to enter my DOB I can't even use the app
"A continually helpful app, having used it for years. Finds almost every destination I want and guides me there with ease. Has the occasional issue when maps are incorrect, but has the facility to flag these and thanks to the map editor community, these are updated. Waze has some excellent features that assist with making driving easier and safer by working together."
"Always provides solid directions and fastest route. I like how it can be customized as well of you want to avoid highways and take the scenic route, for example. Recently I've had some minor challenges where construction hasn't been indicated, but that may be a crowd sourcing issue more than anything else."
"Can't avoid a specific part of the route. It's nice having the fancy traffic and road works routing but you sometimes the driver knows best, something the algorithms don't, and you want to say no avoid that bit. For whatever reason, maybe auto traffic hasn't picked it up, maybe you know it's not busy now but it's going to get busy, maybe it's not suitable for your specific vehicle, maybe it's just personal preference. Whatever the reason you should be able to manually adjust your route"
"The app is good but unreliable, at times it will just disconnect from my GPS and will not reconnect. I can understand if I was underground or was in a tunnel but it does it at random times. As you can imagine it can very frustrating and dangerous where you don't know where you are and your sat nav disconnects."
don't waste time with this in Malaysia if you have grab driver app installed ...
"Waze is pretty much impossible to get working. Always no GPS, but how come google maps works fine on same phone ?? Also it reroutes itself randomly and sometimes not helpfully at all, on the rare times it does work. I mean you can be going down a long straight open road without any turnings for a while and it says ""rerouting"". It's getting worse and worse. It's confusing with the directions. A year ago it was better than google maps but now it's gone backwards in my experience anyway."
"It has been good. It has given me a few good shortcuts. Today it was terrible, the arrow was pointing the wrong way, most of the time it thought I was off the road and often it thought I was on the wrong road. Added 10 minutes to a 25 minute journey. Switched to Google maps which worked fine. Can't use this app if it's not reliable."
"Used Waze for many years and it's a go to app for navigation but is missing lane guidance. The social aspect to it is very fun. The alerts for hazards are among the best and the app will alert you to hazards including pot holes, crashes, roadworks etc. The app is excellent for avoiding traffic and finding quicker alternative routes. The traffic feature is excellent and Waze is owned by Google. Only thing missing is Amazon music integration with the music feature."
"Had it 4 years and it worked OK, however now it keeps randomly crashing/just stopping your route navigation, and since the last update, it won't let you add more than 4-5 reports before telling you you've added too many, which duh, that's kind of the point of the app and on a long journey I'll probably see quite a lot of things! There's also a couple of routes I take regularly that Waze just will not calculate as an option, yet Google maps always shows it so have to cross reference first."
"Where I lose my sense of direction, Waze helps me. The new update has also better pronunciations for Farsi words, so while driving, I just listen to what it says without loosing my concentraion on the map. Things that can be improved. One is that sometimes voice has delay, and second when there is multy exit way in front path explanation is ambiguous and one must look into the map. In all it is quit satisfying."
I can't take picture while I am reporting traffic jam on map. Device Google Pixel 4XL android version 13. One more problem when I am under tunnel and want make same report app say me turn on GPS or be sure you are at open sky
"This app performance has gone downhill. Frequent ""uh oh"" error message popped up while finding the address. Too slow in renavigating new routes when i went the wrong direction. Worst nightmare for users who are bad with directions. Forced me to switch to Google Maps halfway through my drive. Never improved after so long. Considering to uninstall it soon if this problem is not fixed soon."
"Some days I use regular roads and some days the toll roads. Waze toggle to enable/disable toll roads is deep within the menus and not easily accessible while driving. This toggle should be on main nav screen. You should be able to toggle it on/off as needed without having to dig through menues. It is absolutely infuriating when you realize you had selected a non-toll road, but your selection was overridden by Waze due to Waze recalculating the route. Absolutely maddening and time wasting."
"one of the best apps. Now I don't use any other navigator since I came across this. Only problem I have with this is, for some time now, the volume of alerts is not very audible while on the motorways even though the volume is set to full in settings. I tried different phones. Please give us more control over maximum volume. Thanks"
"The best navigator providing dangers ahead, police & camera locations etc. High recommended & have put more than 60 contacts to this amazing nav app. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 100/100. Thank you Waze."
Can't log in Black shark 5 stuck at registration will not let me click ok once select age
"I never leave home without switching Waze on. Waze directs me all the way and makes me avoid massive traffic congestions. It keeps me updated on the traffic flow and at the same time am able to search for nearest petrol stations and places of interest nearby or on the way. The developers may want to look into ""New Drive"" with an option which one we wish to go first and continue with the drive. Thank you and Waze has been of great help to me."
"I've been trying waze as an alternative to Google maps while travelling around doing my job, the alerts for roadworks, safety cameras etc are great and seem very accurate. A couple of things that would be helpful and make me switch permanently to waze The ability to see alternative routes, Google maps shows these with the routes in grey and a pop up message saying how much slower or quicker the route is and it helps me often to avoid traffic. Some postcodes arent recognised, but Google does."
WTH has happened? Jane voice ia great but now they are cutting in wirh some androgynous voice that is really creepy. half Jane half the other. . . .for what reason???
"Useful feature of reporting speed cameras removed from app.... I just read their justification of why they removed the ability for us to report speed cameras in the app.... ridiculous reason: ""it created a nightly task..."" so now, you can only post police. They suggest you report it a hidden police...wth... highly disappointed."
"Unreliable and inconsistent and inaccurate directions, unnecessary detours."
"I used to use this app before you had to create an account and before it started sharing my user data to third parties. A shame really, I had to delete it because I truly do not like the invasion of privacy. Was so good to be able to navigate to various destinations whilst also giving additional information like 'police ahead' or 'roadworks' etc. I won't be using this again sadly and have reverted back to good old Google maps."
"Sometimes the routing is just horrid. Miss one turn and instead of recommending to turn back to that road, it makes me go a longer and more grueling road. Happened several times and more often outside of KL for some reason. For in KL areas it very regularly uses toll roads on the tiniest ETA advantage. The specials like Batman voice and car are nice but really the routing needs more work. Feels like it hasn't change for quite a while."
Over the last three months I have sometimes been sent in the opposite direction of where I need to go. Good thing I know most of the routes. Mainly use Waze for the quickest route. Very frustrating as it has added time on my journey. So today Oct 23rd my journey was a nightmare. Waze kept sending me down roads that were closed. Bishopsgate in the City had lots of road closures. This added 35 mins on my journey. Not at all impressed!
"I LOVE this app. The amount of time it has saved me by showing traffic issues and automatically rerouting me is impressive. So is the issues in the road. We have a large camper and avoiding some of these huge potholes listed by users of Waze is really helpful. I can't recommend this app enough. If you travel a lot, then this app is a must for you!"
"Totally useless at best and dangerous at worst and should be removed from the play store. It usually doesn't work, GPS is frozen in a single location, never moving except the few rare times it does work for a few minutes before locking to a point while in the middle of a drive, leaving you to try to find somewhere safe to pull over and load Google Maps to get you where you need to be."
"For avoiding traffic, this is really good app. Up to date road closures. Only complaint I have is that it doesn't have more colour modes. Sometimes, on fork, I really struggle to see which connecting road to get onto. Is there a way to add more colour schemes, pls? I did see it being a possibility in older versions.."
When searching the results don't list in obvious order eg. Type Bourton on the water and often you'll be greeted with Bourton Tea Rooms or Birdland Bourton as top suggestions before the actual town center. (As a type of example). One major gripe is the inability to notify of road closures on the app - and it doesn't seem to list them either. Using this alongside Google maps and Google seems to know 99% of closures. Sort these out and it's easily a 10/10 app.
"Tried it did not like it, in my view google map is more simpler and straight to point. too much distraction while driving for me on waze, sorry. plus the fact that it tries to keep you moving from back road to another is not always a good thing as if you wait few more minutes behind traffic in original route you get there quicker. anyway keep you moving (even if it takes longer to get to distination ) is not bad for all I guess i.e for taxi driver:)"
"Great app, warns us for road hazards, and we're able update their status."
"Waze itself is great and getting better every day... BUT the Android auto experience is looong way behind and what makes it even worse is that you can't use waze on your phone with all the features, while connected to AA. Another problem is that compared to Google Maps which can utilize the in car antenna and telemetry to know your exact position (even in tunnels and close proximity narrow streets) waze uses only the phone's GPS, which is inaccurate. Please focus on AA as well."
"Decided to deviate from my normal route and follow this app. I effectively lost 40 minutes sitting in traffic. Initial eta looked promising. It does not recalculate eta ahead of time, search for alternate routes, and only advised on the traffic jam when you get stuck in it. The app has become very generic. Next time I'll rely on my instincts. Uninstalling."
"Very disappointed with Waze. Whilst in a hire car in Cyprus, used the app to go to a venue I didn't know the location of. Physically copied and pasted the location from Google Maps into the destination and the app took me a destination 15 Km away from where I needed to be, in hills and onto a housing estate. The road wasn't even named the same as the designated target location. Uninstalled the app & won't be using it again!"
Can't see fuel petrol settings anymore Edit - still not fixed
Waze did not live up to the hype. It frequently sent us a longer way around than Google Maps on both local journeys as well as longer ones. I have now stopped using it as a result. It was occasionally more helpful due to alerts about short term roadworks or hold ups but that didnt compensate for having sent us the wrong way in the first place...
"Usually pretty decent when it comes to finding the best route. Occasionally doesn't pick up traffic that shows on Google Maps which can be annoying. My biggest gripe is not being able to search on route, and not showing search results on the map, when using Android Auto."
"Inconsistent. Often gets confused as to where I am. Can sometimes take me the most convoluted way and not due to traffic congestion. Got me very lost and confused (glitching and telling me to make u turns back the way I came) in some shady neighborhoods. Also, struggles to recenter itself and the indicating arrow points in the opposite direction of the direction I am going. Very disappointed. This used to be my favorite GPS app."
"Generally very good. Two things which bug me though: the map can be a bit laggy sometimes, for example at roundabouts or motorway junctions, and that can cause some confusion. Also, when confronted with a closed road it's not that straightforward to mark this on the map and force a reroute. Occasionally the app will take me on a strange diversion which I assume is intended to avoid traffic but the roads are actually clear..."
"Really disappointed, I used to use this all the time driving but recently it has stopped working properly. The route line marker would have odd gaps. Only the parts of the map that was previously loaded would appear. Locations that were never encountered prevously would not load map data, so I'd be driving on a regional highway and suddenly loose the map with no idea where to stop and change to google maps. I thought reinstalling the app would fix my problems but now there is no map at all."
"I drive for a living, every second counts, so to me this app is useless. Don't get me wrong it's a great satnav, warns about problems ahead, allows you to add a stop to your route. All great. It just takes so God damn long to calculate the route. !!! I don't have time to sit at the side of the route watching a little circle spinning round. Unfortunately for me this is a deal breaker, uninstalled. üò≠"
"It was great, but lately it is full of bugs. You start a new route and he does not start with your present location. Instead, he picks a spot and asks you to come to this spot - even if there is no road to it. And it is CONSTANTLY changing route and updating it. Also, have a feeling many users left the app because live feed is not anymore as it was - shows fanthom speed cameras, no works where they are etc."
I had been using Google maps on my Samsung 8+ and was very frustrated with Google maps always misdirecting me wherever I wanted to go. I found Waze and installed it! This is a great app! It never misdirects me! it gives me several routing options! And stores a history of places I've been. It always me to delete places in the history that I don't need to keep! I give this app a 200% !!! rating
"Can I minimize My Waze? So far I don't see any option to do so. The previous version was without the annoying My Waze bar at the bottom of the screen. In landscape mode, it is taking almost half of my screen, it is obstructing the map. Please don't tell me to set a destination and stop the My Waze showing up instead please add in a feature to allow users to minimize that bar."
"Waze has consistently gone downhill. I do not understand it. The only saving grace is the speed limit information.  When searching for a locaion, even if I have been many times before, the top results will be over 300km away (even if the actual destination is within 10km and has the exact same name).  After setting a destination, turning on music, and driving, it will pop up and ask ""Are you on your way home?"" and then begin a series of actions that attempt to reroute me away from where I am going to go home. Even though I have manually set a destination, and am now actively driving.   Sometimes waze does not request the GPS properly, and GPS never starts, thus Waze has no idea where I am. I can turn on the GPS Status app or Google Maps and instantly have location information, but Waze requires a restart to get this out.  I have a OnePlus 6, so a modern phone only a little over a year old."
Works far far better than Google maps.
"For the most part this app is great and fairly accurate. Most annoying thing is the warnings of typing when driving, then constantly nags you to participate in annoying ads and notifications when stopped in traffic.. it's illegal to play with your device when stopped in traffic in many cities around the world...bit contradictory don't you think.. ü§î"
Freezes a lot while driving if you live in an area with a lot of turns and lanes.
Can you please make it more like Google maps and allow it to automatically route to an address after voice command instead of forcing me to select address to confirm?
"On the whole a great app.. But I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the gamification aspects, candy? What's the point? Who decided playing a superfluous notification to drivers was a sensible idea, should we be collecting more candy hence driving more = more pollution, what is the thinking behind gamifying navigation? Oh and it doesn't support my chosen music player, iBroadcast, directly anyhow."
"Provides better real-time info than Google Maps, but isn't always as accurate. Baffles me why the annoying 'car info' glitch still hasn't been fixed after years of user complaints. The prompt just keeps reappearing unnecessarily even after I've entered my information and takes up valuable screen real estate for no good reason. Google should really combine the best of Waze and Google Maps into one single app; pointless keeping the two separate since they own both."
"don't take route data from motorcycles and put that there for cars, they can pass from anywhere but not the cars"
"I used to love this app and used only it for years, even though I'm an avid Google Maps contributer. HOWEVER, I have come to loathe it. 1) Always chooses the longest route, even if it'll be the same time to get there. 2) Keeps changing my selected route - when I've already started the trip. 3) I do not want to use to highway, especially if it'll add 10km to my trip. 4) Wanted me to drive around 1 block twice, in peak traffic, in an effort to avoid traffc. Moral of the story: I've Uninstalled."
I am able to download and install the app. Unfortunately it only displays a blank (beige) page when I open the app. An icon displays as well as some other functional buttons but infrastructure and roads are not displayed. When I type in an address I recover a message that states that I do not have a network connection despite the fact that I just downloaded the app from that nonexistent network.
"The app does not give you the easiest route. So I used this app to go to a restaurant. It made me go to a small road with zigzag route I got to the restaurant but my friend told me that there is a easier way in the main road it is a just straight path and more easier to get to the restaurant, less time wasted and there are no traffic that time. I do not trust this app anymore. My time is precious so please fix your app."
Not working over car Bluetooth...Play sound to phone speaker is already turned off.
Speed cameras no longer showing or alerting me. Have cleared data and still no joy
"Screen will not show up on Ford sync 3 in my 2020 Escape. It used to, now it stopped"
I cannot update/change profile picture and my username cannot change!!! What an update did you guys do??
Been using the app for several years now and living it. Can you include all ulez cameras? Or slow the community to do so as work any other retorts?
The best gps app in the play store. I can't wait for Coolwalk support on Android Auto
I've used Waze Navigon for several years now. It's the first thing I install on every device.
Still not support split screen on coolwalk android auto. Keep it up
"The best nav app out there!!! But what happened to Janes voice? Sometimes it's her, sometimes not"
"Decent GPS mapping application, but not -superior- in its design quality."
"I love the fact that it alerts you to accidents, construction, where police are, road hazards.."
"Google Maps is the absolute worst. Waze is better, slightly."
"Since the update, my speed camera warnings are not clearing once passed."
"Navigation is good, But need to display the post codes also with the address."
Only works about 10% of the time with Android Auto. Frustrating!
Terrible. Routinely sends you to the wrong place. You'd be much better off relying on Google.
Keep your tracking packets to yourself! You can only use my data as I see fit
"Cool app, Tells me when theres traffic or a car crash stuff like that. I veryblike this app."
"Works only about 50% of the time on Android Auto. When it works, it's great."
Pretty good...but like to see more traffic alerts and stop signs and traffic lights
Was 5 stars. Was working perfectly on my Pixel 5. Keeps locking up on my Pixel 7 Pro and my wife Samsung S20+
Dark mode option is not working. Unable to edit routes on a trip.
Long time user moved to Pixel 7 pro and now Waze doesn't update my location in Android auto it stays static
"Love it they tell you where the camera's at and the construction in the way, the highway patrol everything üôèüèΩüî•üî•"
Why does it jump back to the starting point when I only tsp to move the map?? VERY IRRITATING!!!
"Worst navigation ever, made so many mistakes and drove me totally wrong roads, disappointing"
Loves I heart feature. It navigates to my distination while at the same time I can listen to I heart radio
"Pretty good. But I have a concern. Why when I try to report a police, the police icon never appear on the map?"
"using the google assistant, waze android auto cannot find the destination to the saved home and work"
It keeps crashing and doesnt allow me to sign in. Such a disappointment
"Love Waze, Hate Ads I'm juggling the fact that I like Waze's navigation and interface better than Google maps, but hate the ads that constantly pop up blocking the navigation. I do enjoy the landmarks on the map (McDonald's and Tim Hortons, etc), but the other ads are intrusive and dangerous when I need to clear them while driving. And they do pop up while in motion, contrary to some posts I've seen while searching a fix. I will continue to use Google maps in the meantime."
"Very good waze..from 52min ETA, but actual ETA around 30min..i strongly recommend waze for fastest route mapping."
Great app!!! Would it be possible to add a scale bypass for the trucker?
Badly outdated. Some roads are missing from this app.
Good app but one great option makes so better app it's add some descriptions or comments when add reports.
"We use this instead of our factory fitted Nav, so much better its equally as good as Tomtom i'd say."
"Works well, needs satellite setting, then I would give it 5 stars."
always takes the weirdest routes... really bad experimental route choices
Used to love it. Now it takes me down dirt roads. I got a nail in my tire this time. Not going to use this app anymore.
"Red light camera and speed camera warnings freeze up with latest update. Wont clear and warn of next camera , once you pass the camera"
Stupid app keeps resetting the default voice when used with Android auto.
New updated version doesn't show me a few places around that may be new or just not important.
I want beta app but it shows full. Please developers do something. Thanks for creating the wonderful app.
Perfect !! Just small problem.. It only works With VPN ÿåOn... In IRAN .
Should show how much km in total when adding a stop before your destination.
Unfortunately doesn't work with android auto for cellphones running android 8
Brilliant app. Interactive with fellow Waze people. Is very accurate and
Great navigation system if u want to get to destination faster
Reall great app. I use it all the time. Better then Google maps
I had to leave the beta as it was no longer warning me of police ahead lol nearly got caught out. Its been like it for months
Hello. Something is not working on my car multimedia. Android 10
"Best of the best, always up to date, all thanks to the fellow users for always updating üëåüëåüëå"
Google shut my account after installed this app. Saying it got malware attack through this app to access my google account. Deleting it now.
Looks great but it keeps freezing using Android auto.
exceptional app. the best in vehicle navigation.
Does exactly what you need it to and cause its community based you see things Google maps doesn't
"Used to be the best, has turned into the worst steaming pile of dung, bad in every single way."
How do I delete places I have gone and why are instructions in langue other than English please advise thank you waze is the best ..jim Samsung phone
"Awesome, we had road coverage all the states that we have traveled through"
Cannot select waze as default navigation app. Please fix
Waze was great and now it's not black screen on android auto
"for Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya in Malaysia, WAZE always bring me to longer route and often bring me to toll road. 5 minute route become 30 minute route."
"I'm digging this app, diffenitity offers more insight to one's driving experience."
Worse app. After update it even stop working properly
Last update crashes every time I try to open it
Waze is by far tge very best navigation app this planet has to offer!
"Best useful, especially to learn new routes. Over time you find out which alternate routes are better than the ""main"" route. Sometimes navigation makes no sense e.g. during a traffic jam it might give you a detour just to move a few car lengths ahead, which makes no sense. An alternate route doesn't automatically mean better route."
The new function of the guided lane with highlight arrows is great but I i find that the go straight on display is unnecessary and could be misleading. There's also some bug like lagging and early turning prompt when the turn is 300m away. This occurred only after the new update. please fix these issues as a GPS thats not functioning properly can pose serious danger on the roads. Thanks
"It has been wonderful until yesterday that the speed reading is about 12km faster than the actual speedometer showing showing on the car. For example if speed limit of a place is 30 and I'm on 28 with the car, waze will be showing like 40"
"Been using Waze for years but lately less and less because I started doubting the sincerity of the routing algorithms they use. Routing me to the other side of a city to save a few minutes of traffic, but standing in twice as many traffic lights ending in longer drive times. Routing me back 15 km to the original route the app suggested, when I am 2 km from the destination, etc. etc. Yesterday though was the last straw, there was a road closure and police closed the on-ramp to a highway, this was in the news. When I wanted to drive home I hit the Waze/livemap web page (and then the Android App) and both suggested a route on that highway exactly, so I thought that maybe the road was open now. Unfortunately, police were there, the on-ramp was closed and I had to double back quite a bit. So if you made it this far, you might think that I have nothing better to do but the crux of the matter is that the road closure sign was VISIBLE on the map - someone had already reported it, it's the algorithm that ignored that and routed me there - right over the road block. Waze - you are NOT a startup, you are part of Google since ~2013 and traffic routing is what you do. There is no excuse for this."
Never told us any speed camera and the language are same like Indian lingo.
"Great for community reports but it stops there! This app is great for speed limits, speed cameras, police and other hazards. I wish I could keep using this nav for this reason but unfortunately the actual navigation and maps aren't very good and do not match to Google Maps. The input of addresses and destinations is very old fashioned and not modern or as good as Google Maps. Navigation isn't very trust worthy, I find it takes me down a lot of small back roads rather than actual quicker roads."
"The more you updated the more app sucks!!! Traffic jam don't exist on this app anymore!!!!! Not getting any warnings when traffic jam is a head. Have to use google maps in same time, which has improved very much for reading traffic towards destination! Option to see multiple rutes once you choose direction and them choose which one you want would be amazing!!!! Ikon for sound is to small once you start navigation!! Make it bigger, you have space!! Come on guys. Do I have to do your work or what?"
Great Map/Travel Source.... however often has construction areas incorrectly marked
"This app has changed drastically, in the beginning it was perfect. Now, it seems something has changed it always select the most non direct path and takes you completely out of your way. The direct path is not an option anymore and this I have seen over many trips. I have removed waze, I feel for some reason that marketing is a factor in the directions being implemented.. ie.. McDonald's pays waze and waze directs you to travel by it or another company. Just my though, why add 25minutes..."
"I updated my Waze app and it doesn't work like it use to now. it freezes mid trip and u end up missing ur turn. I had to constantly stop on the side of the road for the app to work again then continue with the journey. I didn't have this issue before the update, I prefer the previous version as this current app has too many issues and I've been lost or late on my trips due to the delays."
This is the best navigation...when it works. Recently it keeps freezing the location and works very intermittently.
"Everything single time, battery saver shuts itself off. And if you turn your phone off so you're not driving 200 km with the screen turned on, the app crashes when you turn your phone back on. And don't even bother using it as a passenger, because it will judge you for using your phone while the car is moving. I think it's time for a new app."
"App is nice and simple to use , but it needs updates. Sometimes it doesn't show cameras or warn about it vocally. Lately app takes you to a wrong direction and makes you turn around. Few times i travelled few hours extra because of it. And the worst feature of the app is adds as always. I hate when they pop in, gets in the way and no button to shut it down."
Overall good but with regards to the over speed limit warning would be good if there was an option for the warning to constantly sound (well every 3-5 or 8 seconds). At present you get 1 bleep and that's it! the speed limit symbol does turn red granted but I tend to drive watching the road not my phone so to have an adjustable repeating sound warning as an option would be much safer all round.
"Initially, this app was in my view the best nav tech going. However in the past 6 months the GPS tracking lags in Android Auto and it is no longer accurate, to the point that I have added miles on to my journey because the app is not up to speed. The features are fantastic, the app in general is superb (When it is working), but it now requires some serious attention/updates before it really goes down the pan."
"Not great, tried this app and not sure if it just American friendly. Here in Canada we use km per hour which doesn't seem to be an option in the settings. It tried to take me in an opposite direction from the address entered. On the road we were on it went blank which could be a serious problem in an unfamiliar town."
"Reliability of this application is still at the low level but better than earlier. It has not crashed lately but still I can't trust it during the long distance voyages. Connection loss (4G works fine), GPS signal loss and Waze for some reason searches for detour when the main road is good enough. Works great with small towns, country side. Police reports are also a good idea. I use Waze along with Google Maps at two Android smartphones and in this case they become a very powerful tool."
"Great app especially since it works well with Android Auto, and gives warnings as to what may be up ahead. My only gripe is that you can't correct the position of a warning point...I'd like to be able to adjust that, because if you drive by a hazard, you need to be able to press the button immediately, and that's not always possible."
Their servers were down I think. I come back to my opinion that the app is mediocre. I would like to be able to add more than 1 stop on my drive. It would be useful on longer ones.
"When the planets align, Waze will be able to connect and find the address. Otherwise its basically google maps with a different UI. Google Maps never has had as much difficulty finding addresses I type in while connected yo5 high speed wifi. Waze also gives poor and unspecific directions for freeway exits."
"No option to preview voices offered prior to choosing. Developers have been contacted multiple times by users & have not responded. Currently, users must take a physical map guided drive to hear their voice selection. Lame. I have uninstalled until they find a way to remedy this."
Please optimise app and stop showing 'Don't type while driving'üëà this give passengers hard time to search for locations and causes times consuming for the driver to reach any destination. P/S: NO ONE CAN TEXT AND DRIVE AT THE SAME TIME Stop giving hard times to the passengers to search for any locations they heading.
"Worked fine for months, now freezes instantly without fail when plugged into the car and displayed on the scren using android auto. Unusable... Another identical phone plugged into the same vehicle works fine, so it's not hardware related. Working again after update...thanks Waze"
The UI of streets has a problem on Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra running Android 13 (Samsung CPU edition). I'm sure that the perfect Waze team are working on it. I just wanted to know when the new update will be released. (One-star rate will be edited after solving the issue)
Having the same issues. Alert never go away. Railroad tracks stay on no matter how many miles you drive. Cross a bridge still there. Shot to the moon still there. Old version was better. Issues.
"Very good navigation and easy and fun to use, this is my goto for my directions and i tell anyone that needs directions. Tell s you about accident or if younlike to travel a little faster police detection and if vehicles on shoulder. Also multiple routes gives you fastest route first. Very good app..üëçüëç"
"Not showing all alternative routes even when adding an intermediate stop. When highway option is activated, even if there an accident on highway, no alternative routes displayed before starting the navigation. When arriving near the blocked highway because of the accident there is no more option to choose an alternative route. So staying hours till the highway it's unblocked. Please improve the alternative routes choices. At least 5 choices."
"Application is practically not usable in landscape mode!!!. More than 1/3 of the screen is taken by ""Where To"" and ""My Waze"" bars. What a waste of screen area! Why not make it floating buttons? Why do I have to always see ""Select your car""? I select it once and it should be enough. If it is necessary, it should be an option in the settings. Waited for a long time, hoping for a fix, but developers don't care. I had to uninstall it"
"For me I only use this app on Android Auto. It needs some work The amount of features which are not available as per the app compared to what's on Auto is shocking. Makes it even difficult to drive and navigate the app. Selecting letters in the search is antiquated. Does not support voice search, or a massive one the type interface on my BMW. Can't add stops, or find nearest petrol stations or other poi. Journey information too Limited. It is good at a set route, and navigating reported traffic"
"Great app but developers ignoring some critical issues... Love the app and now won't drive on the highway without it, but two really important issues are being ignored in the suggestion box: 1. Speed limit is completely illegible as it's too small (ignored in suggestion box for nearly 5 years!) 2. Reporting things while driving not easy enough to see what you're doing (words/pics too small) Both issues are safety critical as they require you to take your eyes off the road for too much time."
"I dont know why everytime it will not run in the background when screen is locked. I ride a motorcycle and really depend on maps for navigation to places and most time i didn't look at the map, instead i listen to the voice direction. The previous version was perfect as it doesnt shut down even when my phone is locked. But nowadays when it interagates with spotify, spotify will work on screen lock but waze will shut down. Can you please look in to this"
This app is not normal he say better rout when u follow u couldt arrive on time for 10km he add 30 min
"Tested Waze at the same time as Google maps. Google suggested a different route (usually faster in traffic), Waze suggested a route that is usually completely backed up but said it was 20 minutes faster than Google. I gave it a chance and Waze was wrong. It even took me through roadworks that had been reported by other users - so it knew about the delay there! Made me pretty late for work! I'll be sticking to Google maps, it seems it updates traffic faster than Waze."
"Used to be better. Often will show the dreaded ""No connection"" message. Sometimes have to restart several times before already activated GPS starts working. Route selection can be questionable, taking me down awful rural roads when there's a better/faster alternative. No longer possible to have multiple stops?! Voice navigation *still* isn't done, and I bloody hate the annoying American voice ""Average speed check zone"" despite using British English. Hasn't been fixed since 2018. Shame."
"App constantly stops and redirect on the wrong way, in order to get the right direction it is necessary to move at leas 20 ft and then it gi es a long arounf route when theres much more direct routes. NOW IS EVEN WORSE!!! It stops in the middle of driving just out of the blue. I have uninstalled and reinstalled couple times, recalibrated my compass but nothing seems to work"
"Adding a star to reflect recent improvements. - Samsung Note 9 - 1/4 times it will show the map briefly before swapping it out with a black screen overlaid with the prompts captions, speedometer. Almost every morning it sees heavy traffic on the highway and recommends I take the service road, except there is light to no traffic and I stay on the highway, only for Waze to then annoy me because it thinks I'm driving 110km/h in a 50km/h speed limit zone on the service road. Why?"
"I like the app and it's notifications, but i have an issue on planning trips. The steps to reproduce: 4g network, gps off, i am adding a planned trip(it shows me only how heavy the traffic will be only by hours, no map preview, i think this is normal), i change the 'from' to another location than i am, i press save and when i am going to planned trips to see the map preview of the trip, the app shows me the starting point of my current location instead of that from the trip. Thanks!"
"The last few updates have been horrid. Constant location errors, can't share location on WA, now when I use Google Assistant it puts what I'm reporting 10 miles away on some road I was on 30 min prior. Laggy and buggy. Location code on this app has gone for a ball. Waze has become more of a frustration than anything else. I'm constantly having to switch to Google maps more and more often just to get to where I need to go without hassles."
Waze used to be awesome. In the last several weeks I can't even get it to operate without rebooting my phone. Very anmoying...it is making me late for my appointments.
Double tap zoom out is not available which is awful
After last update crashes after few minutes of navigation :/
It worked well but it's about almost a year now that it says that there's no gps and can't show exact location. Thing is that for sure is not my phone since it works with other apps that require GPS. I also sent and email for assistance months ago but nothing; no sign from them. Too bad; I used to love it but now it's suddenly useless for no apparent reason. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"I liked this app before as you could see traffic and things like potholes, and I liked how you can predict how long the journey would take. However, I find it annoying when you search a route and it immediately starts giving directions, I have to use a different app just to see how far a place is. Worst of all, the app just gave me an advert for a petrol station while I was driving. They obviously prioritise their ad money over safety. Save the hassle and just use google maps!!"
"Crashes for many years this was the best nav app, out there but recently it's become unstable, usually at the most inconvenient moment. we a,so have it installed on an IOS device and this is also crashing at random. on both devices it's the only app to consistently crash. we have taken to running two devices just in case, especially on tricky routes. not good. let's hope,they fix it."
"Too bad, waze is showing critical conditions when used with android auto. I've been using waze everytime I'm driving until I connected it to my car and waze stopped working."
"I'm updating my review because in reality this is a great app, it's upsetting that some of the voices are only available for a limited time but that's out of their control. Another thing is that sometimes the app takes you of the worst possible back roads in the middle of nowhere to avoid some traffic which is pretty dangerous, I would like to recommend that they give you an option to stick with the most common/popular route if you wanted"
"This is an excellent app for avoiding heavy traffic but it does have a couple of problems. 1. The app will spontaneously switch itself off after around 220 miles: annoying but not a deal breaker. 2. The app WILL burn your screen if used for long periods. I now have ghost images of the speedo and the alert button permanently showing on my screen when not using Waze. New screen cost - ¬£150, not good."
"I have been using this app for a long time now. However, after the recent update the app has been very unhelpful and contradictory. The routes the app suggest frequently change and are incorrect or lead me to places far from my destination. The most recent route it showed me took me to a dangerous location that wasn't even near my destination. Suffice to say my confidence in this app is now low. Please see to it that this is resolved."
"Feedback: For the past 1 month has been very frustrating using the app. When the direction for example to make a right turn at the junction, then almost immediately it gives another direction to make a route further to where the junction is... Besides it hasnt been accurately location the destination. I hope Waze will look into this. Thanks"
"I have been using Waze for at least 4 years now. I would have given it five stars however the App always and I mean always crashes over long distance around the 3 hour mark and requires a reboot. It's a fault that has occurred with every device I've used the App on, the producer's really need to work on getting rid of this glitch once and for all."
"It's pretty good apart from a few niggles for those who drive on the left or use the Imperial system. E.g. roundabout symbols are the wrong way around and the app uses feet as units rather than yards. In the UK, 1000 feet implies height, not distance. Update August 2019 I don't know what's going on with the voices but it seems every day I'm getting a different voice. I'm supposed to be using Kate (UK) but have had three different voices in the days now."
Installed only because it offered ability to select only paved routes. Turned out to be totally useless for planning ahead on our cross country trip as it refused to allow us to look future sections of our trip to assess the time and distances for different route options. When I tried entering future locations it tells me they are too far away! What the hell difference does that make! Renders the Planned Trip feature useless.
"I'd suggest some edits since d end-users' the ones experience what other improvements can be done from an app. Waze is likely used on phones than PC, remove power (on/off) button (still stay on the background). Waze only suggests 3 routes on-screen, I'd suggest the ""VIA"" option. I can suggest a diff. route instead of depend from d 3suggestions. On-screen (on/off) button for: 1. Avoid Tolls 2. Add to favorites a location you stopped, when passenger's the who guided me to the current location."
"why suddenly you have ads that are popping up while driving??? it can distract the driver and cause an accident because the pop up ads are full screen and the ads wont go away unless you close it. after closing the ad and you touch the app, the app will close. I am a waze user for so many years now here in Manila, but if the pop up ads continue after reinstalling this app, I will definitely uninstall and never use waze again."
"Works great, but unable to report hazards using Google Assistant without ""can't find your position on the map"". Seems to be an ongoing issue since Feb 2022. Using P6P so you'd assume I'd have the latest support, but no. I can look up addresses, navigate to locations using Assistant, but it fails to handle any ""report"" functions without presenting the mentioned error above."
App use to be great! Not anymore.. 1 switching between the apps: * waze's screen goes black * or roads are dissappearing so you only can see blue line where to go and your icon. This happens all the time but eventually after multiple times closing and reopening the app it comes to normal. Please sort it out!
"Waze has probably wasted more of my time than its saved. It has recommended some baffling routes that end up wasting my time. It has even directed me to locations that are closed, why on earth would it do this?! More annoying is when I picked a route home, added a stop and then changed settings to avoid freeways. It then deleted my stop without informing me. I would love to see these problems fixed but I can't overly recommend this app."
"Waze is not working. In the last couple of months I only receive ""No GPS - showing your approximate location"". Kinda dissapointed"
"I have been using Waze for quite some time now, as I actually prefer it above Google Maps for all the nice features and Map reports that come wit it. However today I was disappointed by the fact that I was not re-routed to to another route due to road closures. I marked out the road closures from 3 different directions showing that the road was closed, yet Waze kept on taking me back to the same closed road."
"!!WARNING!! Google will eventually delete your account and you'll lose all you points and effort. I've been using Waze since it came out, and I'm now on my third account because Google keeps deleting my old account and they have zero support for fixing anything. Only login as a guest, don't put a lot of effort into it, you'll be happier. They're also better options out there that work with radar detectors. So don't invest in a dying app."
"Waze used to be great, but now it has a lot of technical issues and I'm considering to switch back to Google Maps. 1. Takes a long time to calculate route. 2. Unable to find network or comes to an error even though my network works fine. 3. Shows that I'm on a wrong lane when I'm following the GPS correctly and goes into reroute mode after that. 4. Reroute takes so long and often causes to miss nearest turns. 5. Often crashes and exits automatically."
Has potential but has let me down too many times. The alternate routes avoid a little traffic but never beats the routes I make for myself. The huge problem waze has is that it keeps shutting down without notice when you start your route and lock your phone. The biggest thing for any motorcyclist is that they cannot touch their phone as soon as they start driving. So many times Ive started riding and waze just stops. The amount of times Ive gotten lost because of this is why I give 1 star.
"Not bad. Needs interface improvement. It will give good routes. Very nice displays of speed limits, albeit in rare circumstances inaccurate. I find it problematic to quickly get the right location for destination compared to other apps such as google maps. On number of times initially set out for the wrong destination with waze, but had no such problems when doing identical navigation with google maps. Speed camera info is less accurate than it was in the past. Traffic info is ok."
"After the last upgrade the app started to be complitely useless, I have OnePlus One with 8.1 android, 9, Subaru 2018, Waze can not keep tracking my way with android auto. At the same time, gps voice is working well, but the map tracking of the planned way - terrible - with dark screen, with screen rotation and incorrect zoom... So I have switched to google maps."
"The app features are excellent but It always tends to use a zigzag route. This cases delay caused by unnecessary turns to go from point A to point B. Another problem if the GPS enabled after opening the app It will never be recognized unless we close and reopen the app. Update . Im glad that the GPS activation issue is solved ""Great Job Developers"" Still the number of turns is not taken into account when calculating the best route leading to delays and making the trip more complicated"
"Disappointed. Following the May 29th update, Waze is no longer able lock my GPS position. This is the case for both standalone and Android Auto use. Google Maps and other location based apps still work fine, so is definitely not my device. All the usual reset tricks have been tried to no avail, and I live in hope this will be resolved following the next update. Until then its Google Maps or native Sat Nav use for me, which is a pity, as on its day, it's the best navigation app out there."
"Uninstall after 2 years. Takes up too much memory space and data usage. Takes me round and round and even a further distance and end up longer time, just to save that 1 minute, stuck in traffic lights or housing areas where too many turns. Trust own instincts better, reach faster and smoother driving. Google maps suggests better routes options."
"I rely on Waze to avoid traffic delays on my daily commute, it is great. It has got me out of a few pickles. I like the new feature telling how many lanes can be taken. I liked it when it just started my commute. New features I could suggest are Custom NoGo areas, easy turn routes (use traffic light with arrows intersections rather than crossing main road - I am sure some men would find it useful too) and to be able to say ""Repeat"" to hear last instruction again"
"I am an Uber Driver and I am having extreme difficulty and a very frustrating experience with the Waze App, the arrow/blue car icon that directs and navigates you to your chosen destination is possibly misconfigured as the arrow/icon keeps moving and then a blue dot shows instead of the arrow/icon. I have tried many troubleshooting methods but there's no luck in fixing the problem. Please help to fix this issues for me as soon as possible. I've tried to contact waze via Facebook but no luck"
"Since the last updated I can't sync my app to the car anymore. I use to see live where I was driving, now is impossible"
"Since Waze was taken by Google its service is gradually deteriorating. Many times it seemed like there's no connection between the guiding map and the actual situation. Sometimes it shows traffic jams while no car is seen ahead or anywhere around. Other time it tells you to take a detour while even on the map the road ahead looks free. Frankly speaking, I am afraid to download the update as I don't trust them too much. I'm using Waze as a kind of recommendation advisory, no more."
"I tried again after one year just for fun. it's still doesn't have basic things like lane assist, but has many ads. The speedometer with it's alert is a good thing, but it's not smart, and doesn't know the time based speed limits. The traffic and congestion infos are not true. still some map errors and unknown closures."
"I hardly used it, but it's good so far It have more features but you have to pay monthly I wish to have a feature that it gives predriving viewing on the map so I can observe it before i go on the route, it will make life easier for me as i'm dyslexic and i only drive locally to be safe. I used to have this function on tomtom so it helped me to to go out of my area and found myself more confident and prevented to have panic attacks."
"I've used Waze for 10 years. It does not work with Android auto, just freezes. About time to hang up the hat and delete the app entirely. Also it has never once worked in ten years for a long road trip."
"New bugs: Remaining Tme and Distance Left from the navigation screen randomly shows with extra small font. New ""My Waze"" design at bottom sometimes covers up to one third of the screen, for nothing. You know that search field is false, is just a huge button from side to side. Simple navigation (no destination inserted) is most of the time only possible with partial screen. Every update brings some kind of mess. Changing stuff that works or looks fine, seems to be the main objective of Google."
"Horible maps. Hv used Tomtom, Sygic and Google maps in the past but the colour and navigation path on this app is just terrible. You just don't know which path u r supposed to travel onto. K speed cameras and driving speed is displayed but nothing more than that. I prefer using Tomtom speed camera app overlay on Google maps is the best combination of all."
"Well it was my No.1 driving app but a few weeks ago it just stopped updating position with android auto rendering it absolutely useless. I see others have had the same issues. I've checked all permissions, reinstall the app and replaced the cable. Google maps works fine still looks like I'll be back to that. Not worth the time anymore"
First-time I used the app it was amazing but as I've reinstalled the app I have been stuck in ghost mode for months now. None of the 'solutions' on the website work for me and I've already reported the problem.
"Why does waze stop working every week!! It shows a dark screen ,it crashes. And wants to shutdown. . It used to be so reliable and stable"
Well there is other problem can't even work installed Uninstaller many times now in the phone the permissions part allow when I all using for location. Guss which never works. And the GPS unless at this condition
Would like to give an honest review but Google kids are unable to make it work with Android Auto without contently crashing. How many years will this take to fix? Don't ask me to fill out a service request since this has been a long long long term issue!
"Wazes is vary good üëç tells everything from the trash and anything else on the road. Traffic, accidents, etc. I use all the time. A must have. üëå"
"Every since yesterday the app has stopped working I cleared cache, unistalled and shut down my phone and still nothing. I have an android I had this app forever and never had this problem before, what is going on??üôÑüò† Ratings based on recent experiences"
"Better than a radar detector, loving it because I still drive like I'm on the autobon in Germany. I don't see what everyone is complaining about, it works like a charm for me. I drive from Gulf Coast to Nashville once a month haven't had anyone problems. Along with my radar detector I feel safe driving."
"Waze used to be an excellent GPS app, but nowadays it is getting more and more unreliable. It kept giving inaccurate directions in SG and M'sia and I have to rely on Google Map instead."
"no longer works on android auto after July updates. EDIT: It used to work perfectly until the 20th of July or so, when I updated both Waze and Android Auto. My phone is Galaxy S7 using Android 8.0 and was rebooted, apps re-installed and up-to-date."
I like it so far have used it for only 2 days.......but the speed threshold setting is greyed out and I can not adjust it..... hopefully that can get fixed...
"Welcome to Google's business model, ads...ads...ads, it's all about pushing countless annoying ads generating money with no option to avoid them, while destroying the competition."
Previously the waze will use the best path and exit the toll nearest to the destination. Now it keep redirect to use small roads instead which is freakin annoying. Please fix it!
Last time using this app. Took me around the longest way possible(with no street traffic) which ultimatly made me extremely late for an appointment i was due to make in time. 20 minutes in route just to end up on a street that i couldve been on in 10 minutes.
Will change your route without you even knowing it mid route. So the problem with this is I specifically selected a route with no tolls the app changed it mid directions on its own.
This app has me get fix penalty fines telling me to go down one way streets and then all of a sudden changing directions ...to send me round in the block to continue on the say route..otherwise the was has been good
"A good but not excellent sat nav had a trip today where waze said the ""fastest"" route was via road works, while there was definitely other routes available. I also find that once waze sets your route it seems reluctant to update it as traffic reports come in"
Not sure what happened lately but Waze's navigation just randomly starts bringing me in circles and adding full hours onto my drives. Never been so close to deleting this app.
"Have been helped ultra quickly after having experienced an issue with the app having used a surprisingly huge amount of data on my android phone. Thank you, Waze!"
"There one thing that you have to add like Googles did, it's offline maps, luke you can download the area of where are you going in your next trip, ut s add offline mode!!"
"Waze is the best maps for me, but the android auto integration is abysmal. This needs to be addressed to be like Google maps. Seriously fix it."
Serious problem loading information. Local surroundings appear blank and notifications of road events is not complete. Additional imprecisions caused us an accident abroad. This will be shared with users around me.
Android auto big makes this unusable. Constant freezes whilst driving makes the app impossible to use started around August 22. Fix this and I'll start using it again
Annoying candy or points rubbish that keeps popping up and making a beeping sound every minute. There's no way totnurn this off and the sound is driving me nuts. So unnecessary and useless!
"I am not able to link the Ride Hailing Platforms with Waze.. Waze is down for More than 3 hours... No choice but to use Google Map.. Cause much inconveniences, When it take too long hours to rectify the fault.. we drivers depend on GPS, please fixe it fast"
The new update has not been functioning well and forces me to restart my Android phone. I have been a waze user since the beginning and has never played up this much.
idea: move the icon of reporting a car on the shoulder of the road to the far right. majority of folks are right handed & the majority of items on the shoulder are vehicles. my thumb has trouble reaching over that far due to arthritis. thanks!
"I'm just reinstall ways ! I had it some years ago at that time it was great to use ,I'm hoping it's even better now !some members of my Family say that they love it when traveling off town or in town!so I'm sure I will enjoy as well!"
"Awful navigation to terrible small roads in Ireland Driving around West or North of Ireland it prefers shortest distance to fastest route. Sometimes that's single lane badly potholed rural roads. When sane people would prefer larger motorways, national roads (Ireland) or ""A"" roads in northern Ireland. No ability to choose faster over shorter routes. Directly impacted my families safety."
Been working great up until now. I want to reduce my entries but it won't delete. I also tried to change A to B via C to A to B via D and E. It won't take any changes. You can't delete C then add more than one via. Why?
"I used to love this app but now it won't even load on my phone... just keeps spinning and saying ""just a sec""...I can't even use it anymore. Deleted cache, memory and reinstalled... nothing works üòî"
Waze is not updating the position on Android auto. The map position frequently lags very badly compared to the actual position that it has become unusable!
"Decent enough, but couldn't see how to add multiple stops to the route, nor adjust the navigation volume."
"My account was with my mobile number. After factory reset of my phone, now that I have reinstalled this program, I no longer have my favorite points and addresses, some of which were very important and I no longer have their addresses, I trusted this application and now I no longer have those addresses. I use Google Maps for driving from now on, I'm really sorry for a good app that does the same thing to its users"
"Used to love this app, always used it to plan my trip, decide on when to leave and have an eta. that seems to have disappeared now and was my main reason for using this app. Until you bring that feature back I won't be using it anymore."
"Used to be a great app. Totally useless now. Constantly asking me to enter my date of birth and frequently failing to find a route, resulting in a 'something went wrong' message."
"Hi, you have to look into this every time I use this app to drive anywhere and it's get stuck if you don't know where you going this can be dangerous. Please please look into this so it won't get stuck again."
Waze either closes or loses GPS signal when I switch to a different app or turn my screen off.. Super inconvenient and I can't trust it.. Fix this.
Why can't I use the app and if say I get a call answer phone is in holster ... and everything is still working? Instead I hang up have to go back into the app and asks am I still going here like come on ans then lags from were I answered the phone. Make it more user friendly thank you.
"Completely unusable for Android. Freezes, doesn't load, disconnects etc. It's a shame because I prefer it over Google maps."
"Waze is üíØ my go to everytime I am driving. Love not just the GPS but being alerted to all my surroundings by other wazers (like roadkill, car on shoulder, roadwork, the ticket givers üòÇ) I also like helping others out by reporting. Never leave home without my Waze app!!"
"What an app. This is sooooo much BETTER than google maps. For me, i'd rank it as probably number 1 in a maps app. Keep up the fantastic work wazers. üëçüëçüëç"
Perfectly okay. Needs a Tablet UI. It's also very difficult to find certain settings and options
"This app is wonderful! I travel a lot and without this app I'd be lost, literally! It is informative, accurate and friendly to use."
The latest update has a bug where the ad drop down with freeze and won't unhide automatically which causes half of the app go be covered in a blank ad.
"I dont know why suddenly I could not use this app since it stated that it has no network connection. While at the meantime, there's connection for Google maps. I am using Oppo Reno5 Pro and please resolve this"
"Black screens, every 2nd run of the app. Restarting it sometimes doesn't help. Where is your QA..?? **Deleting and reinstalling didn't help **"
I used to love this ap. Now that I have a new phone without physical buttons it's impossible to fully shut Waze down. It drains battery and resources so I've sadly had to uninstall this ap.
"Will not work. Spent hours trying. Googling fix waze, doing everything I read, you name it I tried it. It just has a black screen and nothing more. Guess I'll be sticking with Google."
Please go back to the previous version with 'later' and 'go now' options.. instead this 'start drive' is so not handy to use. Where is the 'later' option now which i can check what time to leave for my appointment. This update is terrible.
"It could be better!!! Give us an option to set speed cam (distance from our vehicle) like 1km, 2km,5km. Last time was 1km reminder and alert now 500 meters????? How do we can respond to it???"
"I love Waze, is my 'go to' nav app.. for the last week or so though, I get the notification that waze is closed tap to open, when im using it. Annoying and strange."
Most Audio warnings for radar and police are silent. Distance from radar before warnings also needs to be increased. This bug has been around since 2019.
Map refuses to update under Android Auto. Display just sticks for about two minutes and then draws one update. Unusable.
I love this app I drive for my job mostly local between 100 and 200 miles. A day so I see a lot of incidents yesterday I reported a few things within a short time I got an alert saying I am making too many reports and I am at risk of losing my reporting ability okay then I thought that what this was for!! Then today I get an email thanking me for helping so many drivers LOL ????ll
1. Waze audio comes over phone call 2. To many adds 3. Some time GPS lost 4. Always taking long route that is very bad 5. No real time. Time always changing
"Always running for every drive or ride. Cops scan our plates without our consent, we know their location without their permission. Level playing field. The traffic feature is also great."
Great if it will give directions walking. When I downloaded Waze in 2017 it will give driving public transportation or walking. For health reasons I walk a lot. Waze is the top GPS app in my opinion.
"I used to love this app, but now it's so unstable. I am never able to use it without it crashing and having all kinds of issues. Literally unusable now."
"Time isn't effective. Doesn't indicate in any way the real time it takes to get from place to place. Also, the app doesn't analyze the right path to take. VERY disappointed!"
"It mixes languages, Cyrillic, Latin, unable to find some routes on wifi, others on mobile data, some of them unable to find no matter the connection, incorrect distances, horrible route planner with unclear when to depart, when to arrive, a total mess. üôÜü§¶"
"Can't add license plate number for the odd/even regulation in Jakarta. Even though i've entered the number and saved it, it's still left as empty. I'm on android."
"Lately, it's been freezing on me. Android phone is up to date, and permissions look right. Hope it gets fixed soon."
Recently my Waze is not performing as usual. the GPS features aren't working. Google maps continues to work just fine.
Rubbish this app was once brilliant It doesn't connect properly sometimes the only way to get it is restart it all bad gps I used to be able to answer messenger messages by voice command now that does not work What else are you going to stuff with this app As always complaints fall on deaf ears
"I like Waze very much, but when i use it in landscape mode, the Search and MyWaze bars hide half of the screen. I use Waze mostly to be notified about road conditions, traffic and speed cameras. When i don't have a chosen route the Search and MyWaze bars won't hide and the map becomes UNUSABLE! It will be great if an option for Hiding these bars is added. When I use it for navigation, the directions POP UP window is taking TOO MUCH space(almost 1/4 of the screen)!"
"Thus app used to be great. Now, it only keeps you on the largest roads. It routes you directly into traffic. Used to take you around, but no longer does so."
"Android Auto version is garbage compared to Apple. Australia school zones are all incorrect and not flagged. Tried feedback, had to jump through hoops and gave up!! OMG 15/8 bot feedback response inserted noting comment, says everything lol"
"Preparing navigation voice: 0% Some voice languages work, others don't. Sometimes the voice just dissapears, very inconvenient."
What the hell is going on with waze recently? The map just freezes randomly and i almost got into an accident because of it. Yall needs to fix this ASAP
"I've been delaying to download this app... But now that it exceeded my expectations, I'll recommend it to all people who spend most of their working Time on traveling by road. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
"Works well, though can be invassice and use up a lot [$ your batttery...both i[s and Android. However, offers a lot of choice plus super easy to use"
"Waze does not classify the suitability of a path for motorists. 1st, we was directed to a rough terrain with mud holes which was filling with flood due to a heavy rains. Our car almost got submerged with a path near the river and lake. Pls. take note that I was with my senior mother. 2nd on two occasions, we were directed deep into the jungle without people esp at night without street lights. We could be trapped or caught by terrorists. If the app cannot ensure safety what is its purpose then?"
Dude the worst app ever when it comes to directions. Super laggy and literally makes you do circles. Wastes gas and time. Just stick to Google maps over this one.
Waze is the best apps no doubt about it. The only thing that missing is the route for the truck there is a restricted road or areas. Hoping to improved more btw thanks for the apps..
"Not user friendly, I have friends that use it . Very colorful but no good for good direction. 3 of us were traveling to SC I tried to use it and it would not work right smh"
Constantly thinks I've turned off the route then tries to redirect me. Often times out when trying to start a route.
"Very buggy, I really don't understand how after so many years you still can't make an App that won't often get stuck and take the whole phone with it on a 'stuck journey'"
"The apps keep crashing , and keep saying no internet connection (even though there were)and after uninstall and install back again, it is still do the same thing"
"Just happened, suddenly show no network. Been tried uninstall and install back. Still the same. Please fix it as soon as possible!"
As an e-hailing driver im use apps for almost 2 years but now i have to switch googe maps for better route. Nowday the apps always showing option of the far route even we are at highway
After last update quite often hangs in Android Auto. Clearing cache & app data helped just for some time. Investigation & fix is needed from my POV.
Crazy strange. Will be driving down the road and it will say make a U turn. Too slow. Even on my Samsung flagship phone. Tells you to turn after the turn.
Terrible graphics and colours. Can't select type of route ie shortest or fastest. Can't appear to set vias.
This is the best app I have been referred to in ages. It shows everything I need for a short or long trip. Plus it is fun acting too. Very genius!
"This apps is too much disgusting, always loading this location and always show long distance road, . I thanks Google Maps is 100 best .. wazy is not good.."
I usually swear by this app but lately it won't switch off and continues to run in the background. The only way I can get it to shut down is by restarting my phone.
Love the program. I use it with android auto. I wish I could make the speed limit display larger on the map.
"I find Waze to be better at diverting from heavy traffic and finding a route that isn't inundated with rerouted traffic, warning about speed traps, accidents, etc."
I haven't tried the navi yet but just by the fact that it has a little icon for my music so that I don't have to screw around while I'm driving with my phone to try and get the music back up is awesome
Works great while driving. The only suggestion I have is incorporate a walk function and public transport.
This is my 6th time trying to use this app. It won't load beyond the first screen where you get a spinning wheel and it says Just a Sec... I'll go back to Google Maps.
Almost a year later and you still haven't fixed this annoying issue!!! It would be nice if it tells you turn left or right arriving at my destination. I'm uninstalling smh
Since this app had its update. This app shows longer travel time. I tried using this from intramuros to Calamba and it showed longer travel time taht time was 130pm and my arrival time is 430pm. Something is really wrong
No voice when i pass on m6 also not showing to me the speed cameras the app makes mistakes. Didn't show many cameras in m6 also no sound no voice no notification! This is not because low the speed or anything.
The app wanted to take me miles out of my way on a straight forward journey Shrewsbury to Kettering even on the toll road it wanted me to head towards Leicester way to high up the country .but the warnings of broken down vehicles and speed cameras was good .
We downloaded and used this aid driving to Orlando FL and back. I was with my daughter who had waze. I downloaded it to my phone as soon as I got home. Great app. üëç
I love this app. Do you have any plans to do a semi truck nav? 09/14/22 Android 12 updated and now when using Waze it crashes my phone and keeps restarting my phone.
The app is severely missing a lane display to show you where exactly you have to drive at interjunctions and splitting motorways. The rerouting is buggy and needs constant resetting.
Would be better if I could easily remove past navigation addresses. Does not always work. Could offer more alternate routes.
Latest update took away the time to leave option.... Well kinda now I've gotta close the app and go back in for that feature... Liked this more when that option was present when picking my destination
Not good. The app attempted to drive me directly into road works on multiple occasions. Not sure what happened it used to work a few years back.
"Good so far, and having gas stations is a cool feature. However I drive an electric car and having charging locations would help me much more than gas stations."
"What have you done to this app? It used to be great, now if you back out of the app and open other apps, it'll lose its directions and shut down. Fix it now, don't reply with a bs automated comment either, just freaking fix it."
"Is not working well. The voice instructions not always work. We must be always looking to the smartphone to know what to do, and that is dangerous for the drivers."
"Would be great if all features on the phone can be used on android auto,, can't even read map chat.. Sometimes reports dont get reflected through AA.. Cant read chats on map.."
"Can not login with Google account. After I have agreed to share my data from Google account and clicked allow there is this waiting animation and after few seconds new page occurs: ""No account found""."
"Very slow, not showing correct location lt just started because it was fine on Friday. Emailed support. Android Auto"
The best.. when I turn on for my directions.. always tells me everything earlier as I'm getting closer to my destination.. so easy to follow directions it's the best GPS I've ever had and I'm a 74 yr old senior üëç‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è
"App has become a useless application. Frequent crashes, numerous disconnects and sometimes cannot connect to network at all"
Rarely works on Android Auto. The map will just freeze in place while the audio alerts will still work.
"I had open my GPS and restart my phone again and again but the app showing ""No GPS showing your approximate location"". Moreover, the mark is circle and stay at a point, can't use üòï"
"Waze ended the navigation at destination but in actual fact, the destination is opposite the road. You still need to driver another 1km to turn to destination. Is Waze getting complacent?"
"""Could not locate end point"" ""Can't connect to GPS"" ""Could not locate end point"" ""Can't connect to GPS"" ""Could not locate end point"" ""Can't connect to GPS"" NEVER have these problems with Google Maps... I'd *love* to love Waze but it makes it impossible for me."
"It's not even able to find route between Wawa, ON and Kenora, ON. It doesn't not even cover whole Ontario ? This application can do much better than this."
"List of Toll & HOV passes feels like chaos. Impossible to find local passes, these should be on the top of the list. Passes should have expiration date also."
"A recent update (to the app, not Android) has caused Waze to sometimes stop progressing during navigation, causing me to lose where I am."
Loved this app but..it no longer gives the time to leave and early push notifications. That's so useful but all of a sudden stopped working.
"App is not working. It keeps on showing ""Just a sec"". I've been trying to fix this for 4 days now. Very inconvenient!"
Will reinstall and give it a shot when you can drop pins on locations that don't have an address. We don't all live in cities.
"Getting access to my previous account is almost impossible. So now, after many years I apparently have to create a new account and have lost everything. You need to fix this you morons..."
I'm usually the navigator when we go on road trips. This is the best app by far. It allows me to report out things I see and give live traffic information.
The app is so amazing even I can not drive a car due to injury but I always see my friends much more use it which mean it is really cool and incredible.
"I used it a lot traveling the different cities, never let me down. I have recommended it to all my friends an they have downloaded it. An stated they ‚ù§Ô∏è love it. Thanks"
"Was great but last few weeks location freezes with Android auto. Google maps works fine, tried uninstall reinstall but still no luck."
I have using this app for a long time. But very disappointed with the new update. GPS oftenly not detected. So I used gmaps again...
Gives wrong directions. When one has to turn left to get to a destination knowing where I had to go to & Waze told me to turn left to a destination at the end of a road. Fix ur App directions please.
"Very bad experience, the app does not load up always and says ""no network connection. Try again later"". Please help me as soon as possible to fix this issue."
Uninstalled. Even worse than google maps. Where the heck are the settings? They only seem to appear the first time the app is started.
Have used Waze for years. Lately it loses GPS tracking regularly while in auto mode restart of phone did not help.
"Excellent in everything and anything you can imagine when concerning traveling, routes, and getting to your destination safely and quickly...."
Won't actually start ride showing the navigation. Shoes the whole map and talks directions but won't show turn by turn.
"The surprising route changing during the navigation is really ANNOYING and is also VERY DANGEROUS, you need to solve that issue please."
"Arghhh!!! Whats wrong with WAZE?! keep on showing no network connection. My wifi is on, i can surf internet as usual, but WAZE not working!! Help!!!! (Last update on today)"
"For the most part I like this app, though it gives some strange route directions at times I just ignore the ones that don't make sense and it recalculates the route. It also has quite a few incorrect street names and I have gone to their website to request corrections for some of the worst ones I have seen."
"Not possible to install. Code received in Gmail, entered into app and then error, try again. Then address verified but again error and so on. De-installed with relish."
This app chooses horrible routes for no reason. It changes the view autonomously which messes me up. If there is another app use that instead
"Excellent app, like the live traffic update. It's only as good as the people using it, thankfully there's very few idiots to stuff it up for everyone else üôÑ üòä"
Navigation sometimes it's confusing and not accurate always going very far and not taking shorter route.
"This past month the maps are lagging, which is no good to me anymore. I cant drive in central london not knowing where to go anymore. Im back to google maps"
Drives aren't loading. Waze was fine but the last few updates have made the app unusable or took away features I enjoyed using.
"It was working until the update, GPS drops a lot when driving, had to switch over to Google maps."
"Noisy usless notifications. ""Do you still want to drive to this place you searched an hour ago?"". I hope they realize getting one such notification inspires me to turn off every single notification channel"
Totally unsatisfied. It has twice led me to dead ends where there's no road at all. I'll improve the rating when this issue is addressed
"This app is incredible! Tells u when there's a cop ahead, car on side of road, and even if there's something in the middle of the road!"
I don't want to give waze any rank You put me In serious and dangerous situation. I was in an area I didn't know at all you made me face the oncoming vehicle by telling to turn right where I was not meant to turn.i have to quickly make a u turn when I noticed the road thank God the road was not busy. I can't trust you anymore am disappointed .
"The dreaded ""Connecting..."" text appears as the app's functionality withers away. An absolute shambles..."
This app is not working on my phone and. I dont know why can anyone help how to set my waze app on my phone plss help me i try everything but still it doesn't work always updating navigation...
Some directions are bad such as using a stteet with a stop sign ti cross a main road instead of 1 blk away with a stoplight. Overall it is good.
"The app was great, now when plug in via android auto the maps keep freezing, have to keep cancelling route and reprogramming destination"
Great navigation app. Helpful with avoiding traffic. Good companion for road safety compliance guidance. My first choice any day
"2022,improved,sort of. Then lost address side of road assistance. iOS has the feature with Google map,just did over 3000 km road trip.Android Waze now only announces ""you've arrived."""
Problamatic apps... after update.. gps not function.. always crash.. need to restart... sometimes after restart also cannot function... need to uninstall & reinstall ..
"Can't login. I was sent an email which showed my username,but when I click the link it says ""No account associated with this email,""?! When I use my username/password to log in & it says no connection"
"can you add a way to see what state youre traveling in...i drove from MA to FL and i didnt know what state i was in unless i saw the capitol name on a sign...most of the states on the way down dont have saying ""Entering Delware,Georgia,NC,SC,etc)i had to use google map fir that info and id rather just this app...please and thx"
I'm not sure.. I turn the app on to mark police but it's next to impossible to mark the police unless I'm parked beside them.. please change this.. as well I should not have to make a destination to mark police.. make this app easier to use please üôè
Why when gas is over 4 bucks a gallon is this app specifically rerouting me to pass through tourist traps off of my path. Literally pulled me off 95 to put me back on an exit later so it could pull me through South of the Border. Added time and miles to my trip for something that was obviously paid for by this hellhole of a trinket flea market. Way to both cost me money while you pocket more.
Waze came highly recommended from another user and I am already hooked! This is the best navigation and GPS app ever made. It makes driving fun.
What? I can't even do anything. I just downloaded the app and had to restart and re-download the app too many times and still nothing. Not even a keyboard to type.
"Southern Way in Clevedon North Somerset has been closed one Way for most of last week but was shown as not closed on Waze. Today, Sunday when it finally opened again Waze decided to show it as closed ???ü§îü§îü§î. I tried to show it as closed during the week but Waze on Android Auto would not let me as it doesn't have that option. Why not????"
used to be fine but currently suffering from a bug that causes it to shuts itself off if you switch to another app/have it running in thr background
"Used to be great, but has problems working with Android Auto for a while now. Shame. Will change rating if fixed soon."
"Love the app. I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way but, I'd definitely pay .99 or so to be able to download voices I want to use like Darth Vader or Peter Griffin"
This app no longer works on newer Samsung phones. It was absolutely my favorite navigation app. Really disappointed now.
"Great when isn't open, but the fact that this app won't stay running in the background and continue to give guidance is a big negative."
With new android update its glitching on android auto. It's like it's not recognizing the location and freezes on screen
"It is too bad that I can't change my vehicle license plate anymore. The option is still there, but when I hit ""save"" after changing my license plate, it doesn't do anything."
"Does not route to avoid Khan's rotten's ripoff ULEZ expansion even tho I only have the French CritAir added! When I tried to plot from Walsall to Dover it insisted on routing via Khan's rotten zone even when I selected ""Via Thurrock Services"" as a waypoint ‚Äì it even routed me back along the A13 into London and into the Blackwall Tunnel and thro' the congestion charge as well! What's wrong with the M25 direct between the M1 and Thurrock Services?"
"The worst app ever ,keep calculating...almost I reach the destination without your app.... Showings wrong road and rounding for no reason... Worst ever ."
"I love, or should say loved this app. With the latest update it's not as user friendly setup preferred time of arrival to a destination."
"Accurate, efficient, and easy to use! Love that it has live traffic updates and that you can report potential hazards as you go."
Don't use anymore as the ads take up 1/3 of the screen. The little ads were fine.
"Won't work it is always stuck on the ""just a sec"" screen and won't leave tried all the resolve tricks on YouTube but still nothing."
"Love it, although every now and then I just loose connection for a couple seconds. Hopefully issues gets corrected in updates."
"Bad update After recent update, it keeps saying no network connection. I can't use app anymore. I'm forced to use Google mapsüò•üò•üò•üò•üò•"
"Random loud annoying notifications when not using the app. ""Hey, come use Waze"" etc. Bruh I'm gonna use it when I need it. Stop annoying me."
"Number 1 for my navigation here in Thailand. Have only one little thing to complain about before i give it the last star. And i am sure you have heard it 100 times before. The search field, it take way too much of the screen when not following a course. I am happy to pay for the app if it disappears. Other than that, a super program. Way better than google maps."
"I love Waze, loved the old Waze better. I don't like the Google Mapsification of it. And why does it not stay open in the background anymore?"
"Terrible , so many mistakes and mislication , only good for traffic"
I don't know what y'all did to this app after that last update but it's messed up now the app just sits and like it's buffering or something it won't open up it takes a long time to open up and then as far as the GPS is like 2 minutes behind it'd be just not getting a certain streets when you like 2 miles away from that street
"Quite often Road closures are not reported, and it is hard to add them when on the move. I find I am unable to add a closure despite being a subscriber."
Love Waze and would rate it a 5 star but it doesn't leave an icon in my app drawer to quickly launch. It launches fine in AA but to launch it on my phone I have to go to settings-apps-scroll all the way to the bottom of the list select and open. I've searched everywhere for a fix and haven't found one yet. It is the only app that has ever done this in my 20 plus years of owning a cell phone. Android Galaxy S9+
"Keeps crashing and restarting every few seconds when used in Android Auto. Started happening recently in the last week or so, happens repeatedly every journey. Reverting to Google Maps until this is fixed.... Edit: I ended up getting a new phone and this isn't occurring now. However, this app is crying out for some really basic features concerning camera alerts - firstly it needs the option to alert ALL cameras, regardless of whether you're below the limit, along with a second warning within 50m or so as you reach the camera. Secondly it needs the option to customise the alerting distance. Mobile cameras can operate up to 1000m so it's entirely possible that you might already have been caught before Waze even alerts you to the camera. TomTom's camera app has these features, it would be nice if they could be implemented in Waze."
Averts are incredibly distracting. Why anyone can consider plastering adverts on a screen for a driver to read or have to dismiss because it interferes with navigation needs moving on. Revenue before safety is not the way to go. Get rid of the adverts while driving. App cant navigate using Eurotunnel as a route waypoint. Not everyone uses Spotify. Add the facility to open preferred music app.
"Waze does everything to make your life worse while using it. Main problems with the app. Its way too slow, I run PUBG better on my phone than waze. It cannot find my Gps. Other apps such as google maps work fine, this one somehow doesnt. Some buttons don't correspond to the clicking. 90% of the time when starting a route, my car drives backwards in the waze app."
"Waze always finds a way to let me down during my trips. Sometimes it will crash, others it will ignore my destination and reset as if there's no destination set (all that in the middle of a highway). I used to be a huge fan, but now I've been using Google maps more and more."
"The loss of ""ok Waze"" to set a destination is huge. As a commercial driver I often need to change my destination while already driving, with distracted driving laws I cannot touch my phone while driving. Loosing the voice activation means I now have to pull over and park to legally change my destination. For me Waze lost the biggest feature that set it apart from most other GPS apps or units."
"It's generally very good indeed, the one very irritating feature of it, is it states distances to roundabouts and turnings in feet rather than yards. Why can't it state distances in yards? Also too many adverts pop up. I know that they have to get revenue from it, but why does it seem to make them pop up at the most inopportune moment."
"It would be very nice to have information shown about elevation change, for ex: I want to overtake a car, waze is showing me straight road, but in reality there is a valley, and it is very dangerous to overtake in that situation"
"It was fine at first but as times goes by its getting useless. Bringing u to the longest route, wasting much time, giving inaccurate traffic report and showing the illegal route. When it shows the route was jammed, but it wasn't at all. Also, it even show me the illegal route and this was the part of reason I got into a car crash. Different user using it showing different route, so which is the right one and which is the wrong one????"
"Overall very good, with a couple of infuriating issues. Can't handle scheduled A-B-C trips, despite the menu structure pretending it can (it just ignores the B-C part of the trip). The 'report an issue' form is nonsense: asks for a username and instructs how to find it, despite there being no username there, and I cannot submit the bug report because it says my email address is not valid. Makes the whole thing feel a bit amateurish."
"This app always gets me to a different address, usually 50-100 meters away from the destination. This is really bad for delivery services. Also, if given the opportunity, it will take the driver in the back alley, which has no entrance in the building. This is terrible for delivery services! I ride a motorcycle, I do NOT need to get to the back alleys and I need to deliver FAST, not search for the building entrance! L. E. I just messaged Waze on FB, nobody bothered to answer!"
"For the past two years since using Waze it's been consistently good, avoids traffic, etc. The past 3 months it has been taking me into a lot of easily avoidable traffic routes. Using my own common sense or following maps has helped me out massively. Not sure what changes have been made, but please rectify these. I use Waze to avoid traffic, not be brought into it when there's much clearer routes blatantly available."
"Best GPS ever, it is a must even if you know the rute, can save you a lot of time in traffic. Update 10/2020: Disappeared from Android Auto, I don't know what's going on, I am looking forward to using this app again but some very bad developer decisions have been going on lately I guess. Update summer 2021: Working again in Android Auto. A must have, best GPS, simple as that, and I have tried many and in so many different situations"
"Now it no longer opens. Stuck on initialising because there's ""no network connection"" bwahahaha. Used to love this app but recently it has more issues than worth it. Can't even report bugs using the in-app service. Constantly locks up. Can find a place but can't select and navigate to it. Can't plan a drive anymore, etc etc"
"This app truly used to be brilliant. I used to recommend Waze to everyone. But since Google have bought it the app has become questionable. Just today I witnessed it guide multiple drivers (including myself) to a dangerous off-limits road. It's just disappointing. Before Google, the main thing Waze got wrong was pronunciation. I hope the original team make another independent navigation app!"
"I drive doing deliveries for a couple of different platforms, so I use different Nav. for my personal and for business. I use Waze for Lyft and Google Nav for Spark. Lately I have noticed that every time I pop out of the Waze app to look at another page, the app will lose my GPS and not be able to find me for some very crucial mins. I find this very frustrating, especially when I am going to pick up a customer and Nav can't find me. Anything??"
"User interface funny/curious/idiosyncratic --- no way to pre""view"" voices which is strange. Not enough info/ options/alternatives for trips; even Petal shows number of red light stops now. Now in 2022, I'd want a gas consumption per hour of driving metric for trip alternatives , that scales realistically with traffic jam and stops/red lights. But, otherwise relatively nice navigation!"
"Very useful, but not so much if you don't have data coverage. My top useful/missing feature is the option to AUTOMATICALLY change between miles/km when travelling between the UK and continental Europe. I know there is a manual option, but it would be so much easier if automatic and I would give it 5*"
"Definitely love this app as it's super helpful with speed limits, police radars, speed cameras, stopped cars on shoulder and much more. Although, one thing I'd love of you guys added the following: 1) An Offline and downloadable map so that when I go outside of my data coverage I can still use the map, although I do understand that won't want be notified of stuff like cops. 2) Would be helpful if we could add shortcuts to homescreen of certain addresses. thank you!"
Overall pretty good for navigation but 3 key issues that annoys me: 1) frequently saying my phone does not have network connection (when connection is fine) and loses functionality. 2) would be great if able to display the destination address. 3) takes quite a while to generate routing. Might be better if the local map database can be stored on phone and synced occasionally.
"Great app and, when it works properly it tends to be better than Google Maps. However it occasionally glitches with searching for locations and with finding a GPS fix. It also relies more on user updates reporting on slow traffic rather than taking feeds from GPS data. Whilst Google maps may be reporting slow traffic, if you've got Waze and are first to a traffic jam you won't know it's there. So Google Maps tends to have a better idea of traffic data, but Waze is better with time in traffic."
"Sent me twice on a wild goose chase, app gets mixed up, indicates to turn around on the freeway when I know I'm headed in the right direction."
"Still twitchy as all hell. Can you just not have the app load up, and let us type the address without trying to guess it before I've put it in? Makes you press a saved location by accident and have to start over again. Load slash screen, map and stop, just stop lol don't need animation features or this and that, just to load, put address in and one press to go. It's so sad how bad this app has got, it runs rings around Google Maps, well, it did until of late."
"Seriously, fix the unholy affinity for unsignaled left turns. These are very dangerous. Especially on 2-3 lane boulevards."
"Used to be my go to Navigation because of the traffic reports and speed limit info. Google maps is catching you up in this regard. Exiting Waze when reaching destination has always been irritating with its pop up window after pushing the back key, now its the reason I have switched to Google who have a ""Done navigation"" button to exit their app making existing simpler. When reaching my destination i want close the app quickly and exit my car. Waze extra step is annoying. Hope you sort this out."
"I originally gave it 5 stars. My current feedback for the developers is to please make the Google Assistant-Waze integration OPTIONAL. On Android devices I either have to use it, which implies a lot of errors, or to completely switch the Assistant off on my phone. Why not have both? The Google Assistant does a great job in general. Yet if I had my say, I'd rather NOT use it for Waze (there are many language related errors). Thank you."
Great when it works. Since months it appears to be an error once you type and look for the routes. It says uh oh error server or something. Changing to home or any favorites mostly work. It appears to not be resolved which I gotta say is a pain in the ass when you find yourself I a Hurry. Else everything is great. Cons battery consumption. Would it be possible to add the remaining time up to the next exit(highways) roundabouts etc. I ll give it 5 stars back when the uh oh server is solved.
Great navigator. But since stupid Samsung s20 updates it come up no network and shut down even network fine on phone. I think my Waze need update to work.
"Only thing missing now is the feature to share driving location from within Android Auto In-Car display. I always have to start Waze on my phone, get the required route, share the drive, and then I can finally connect to my car. I have tried assessing Waze on my phone when connected to my car, but it doesn't let me enter the app. Really inconvenient if I'm already on the go."
"Great functionality.. Good to have quick reporting of traffic & other aspects. Lags in ability to accurately predict quantum of traffic & this correctly estimating time to destination. Google maps much more authentic in that aspect. Another aspect, doesn't accurately capture the exact vehicle orientation at the start... & you may end up heading the wrong way for the first few hundred metres... Needs to be faster in recognizing once the GPS has moved few metres"
Nowdays showing the short distance routes very far.. Today morning before i before drive i search the address i want to go google map showing 40km but waze showing 49km. Very lazy want use waze and mind disturbing
"Easy to follow instructions. Reroute automatically but sometimes it will give you longer distance route just to avoid traffic which for me is not really necessary depending on the situation (if the usual route I take is not really heavy in traffic, it will just waste my time having to take the longer route). Overall a really good app. Helped me a lot. Thank you developer."
"I'm not sure what I'm not sure why, this app was great before but now it feels bad to use. Today is the last straw, this amazing app asked/direct me to turn into the opposite lane. Coolüëç"
"My most used app! Waze has, for me, went from a pretty gimmicky app to one that I couldn't do without. I never leave for a journey without firing it up and I've found it incredibly useful once hooked up to facebook. It will alert you (unprompted) if there is a delay in getting to events and also is extremely accurate when it comes to journey planning via times. Brilliant app. Keep up the good work, Devs!!"
"After years still poor vs Google maps. Can't search while driving. Can't use on phone screen while connected to Android auto. The routes I don't know. Maybe google got better but this doesn't seem to be an advantage anymore. It can access your calendar but it is still not able to access the address of your appointment half of the time. Even though you can select the address as it pops up, it will not understand what the address is. voice is no use, it shows a bunnings 20km away instead of 1km."
Feels like 2 steps forward and one step back. Some of the audio issues had previously been resolved but are now back after the latest release. Announcements stop Spotify audio with the only way to bring it back by skipping the track. On other announcements the music audio goes low but doesn't go back to full volume after the announcements finished. Again you have to skip the track for audio volume to get back up. To top it off getting network connection issues again (oneplus 6 - android auto)
"Would be 4 stars, but only now can add one stop makes it stupid, having to stop turn of engine, just to re do the sat nav. At a min 4 stops so u can choose the way u wanna travel. Like the route today I need to travel, yesterday it had loads tipper trucks full of dirt, stones flying everywhere so I choose to go the long way around until road works have finished as I don't want any more damage to my screen, but sat nav makes it impossible to do just one journey the way I want to go. Could dobetter"
"Waze was before a 5 stars app. but,now it is no longer accurate on highway. it is just good in the city for about 10 miles. do not use Waze if you have long distance in front you and on the highway, it send you on any exit you have on your direction. I don't know why it was like that in 2019.That happens to me many times; but ,now it's working good."
"The app is great but there's one thing that bothers me: there's no way to select alternative routes. Every i use it on the way back from school, it keeps trying to take me the long way on the A1. In reality this route makes little difference and can sometimes be longer. Google maps offers multiple route, so please couldyou add the ability to select between multiple routes?"
I've always used Waze on my regular routes to get around traffic jams but lately it is just awful. It never takes you by the fastest route. I often ignore its suggestion and suddenly the trip time is 5 minutes faster - so it knew there was a faster way but didn't tell me! And don't get me started on the GPS issues that everyone else is complaining about. They seriously need to fix this app or finally integrate it into Google Maps like they do with everything else they buy.
It works ok but all these silly ghost symbols that appear to be nothing has made me dislike the app and will go back to google maps. More of an adult app.
"There should be an option for showing a small compass at least while manually checking the map. Once it is rotated - even by accident - it can be extremely disorienting. Other than that the app is great. Thank you, devs! Edit: nevermind, I was dumb. If you tap the screen once a compass does come up"
"My experience with Waze is in relation to the Mazda android auto interface. It's pretty good at what it does and the hazard features etc are pretty handy. I'd like to see it remember routes after the car has been turned off and on again (e.g.stopped at ships or to get petrol) I'm not sue if it's Waze or Mazda's issue, but lack of touch screen support (when stationary) is a bit annoying. [Edit] Waze seems to remember routes after car turned off occasionally, now. Biggest headache now is voice navigation issue: I give a command, the command appears as said on the nav screen, the address Waze offers is the street only, not the number, which is an issue on those long roads. (May be Mazda, may be Google, may be Waze)"
"Too much junk on this app. It tells you stupid stuff like car on the side of the road, who cares! Debris on road, who cares! Just pay attention! Too many unimportant remarks."
Sad.. can't check traffic with out mandatory location on.. what a stupid idea
"Works pretty well in combination with Android Auto. The only thing I would like to see changed is the way day_mode or night_mode is selected. Add another user selectable mode where this selection is based on the current time. My headlights are always on, so waze is always running in night_mode when used in combination with Android Auto. This shouldn't be to difficult to add..."
"I l love the concept of this app, but there is the problem that it keeps crashing or showing ""no connection"" or ""no gps"". It gets very annoying as once it is restarted, works again, perhaps for another hour or two. Then there is a chance it gets stuck into a ""calculating route"" just randomly and, again, needs to be restarted. This is serious: restarting an app while driving is DANGEROUS!!! I had to go back to google maps.. Ps - I have no facebook, if you need extra info, I can help here."
"Been using it for a while thru AA on my SEAT Leon. Had been working nicely, but for the last week it takes ages to find my location. Google Maps finds it instantly so its not and issue with my phone. Also, when the guidance shows a roundabout, the arrow goes the wrong way around the roundabout, which is slightly annoying for countries that drive on left."
"Used to be great, now glitches everywhere. Apparently no data but I'm sat on full 4G. Won't let me use the app even though I clearly have data."
"Waze used to be good, but in recent months it's just unusable. 9 out of 10 times it has difficulty to find a route and keep loading forever or just straight out fail to connect. Looks like Google is abandoning Waze and focusing on Google Map instead. Google Map is fast to load and doesn't over promise the arrival time. I've given Waze enough time but they don't seem to be capable of fixing the apparent issues for several months, so they deserve this poor rating at least for this version."
"Used to like it..but since it keeps on freezing & crashing while using, it makes me lose the way more than helping finding it..and why would you even guide us through a route that is not possible, too cramp, or even against the flow?? I almost got sued by driving through private property..learn about the route properly, it's your damn job!! As time goes by, you should be getting better, not worser..these kind of apps are here to help people..fix this asap or take it down before someone got hurt."
"Waze is in Need of A Serious UI Overhaul - Why are we still using this clunky old UI that's been around since the dawn of Waze Time. Something more modern like the Google Maps Navigation would be very welcomed at this stage. The functionality can also suffer sometimes often crashing and re-routing. Oh, and the biggest problem of all...even with NO traffic this app regularly takes you the longest route or at least second longest route possible. I've tested this in areas I'm very familiar with!"
"definitely chooses the shortest route but sometimes goes a little OTT had it send me down a tight alley way. to cut off a bend in the road was about 10 metres shorter but took 5 mins longer because of how tight it was. has also taken me down un paved roads even when I had it set to avoid them. not ideal in a VW Passat. still have it 4 stars. I no longer use it for navigation I just use it for the warnings. speed camera, hazard ahead etc.."
"It seems that sometimes gets wrong about the car position and issues wrong instructions (maybe since the last update or perhaps just yesterday). Also, Google Maps shows more useful data (e.g. the number of the next highway exit to take) and is less intrusive (e.g. if I manually move the map, it doesn't rollback my change in a few seconds, it simply waits until I touch ""recentre"", so I can browse the map along several semaphores)"
"..has neat features (speed limit, crowdsourcing), BUT $#!+s the bed with Nav time and time again, offering horrible routes, refusing some roads, or not using obvious shorter-route. Someone please explain what the heck it's thinking? If considering traffic, then illustrate it. If considering fuel economy (gas, electric) illustrate it. And it would be useful if it could learn from my driving for future consideration, so it doesn't keep making mistakes."
"Better than Google maps, except you cannot control when it decides to change the view, or make loud announcements. Very frustrating to control if you are trying to drive. If you happen to want exactly what the app chooses to give you, though, it works well."
"A long time fan now uninstalling. Problems with app dropping, voice and keypad searches yielding zero results even for popular landmarks, poor navigation instructions and lack of support where map issues exist (delegating to community editors is fine but there should be a process for stepping this up where a danger is highlighted by a user and the editor states it is fine as is). Google Maps has fewer features but it's reliable and safe."
"Great app but a massive battery drain. Everyone says this is due to the app constantly being online but wait a minute, isn't google maps always online but a 30 min journey on Google maps only uses 10-15% of my battery, if that, whereas waze uses nearly 30-40%!! This puts me off using the app so even though I have it installed, I see myself going for Google maps over Waze on most journeys. The community support however is great, alerting to stationary cars, potholes, police and the like."
"I'm giving 2 stars in the hope a developer sees my review. The app is great but it's one downside is the short notice for alerts. It would be great if there was an option to increase the alert distance. Sometimes speed traps are at the end of a long straight and your speed is checked way before your alerted. Other than that, it's a great app for traffic etc."
"9 times out of 10 waze estimated time of arrival is off. The route which is meant to take the shortest amount of time ends up taking the same amount of time as the longest if not more. The back street routes take you down narrow streets that are usually hard to navigate and full of other waze drivers trying to save 3 minutes by avoiding the main roads. From now I I will only use waze as a guide and not trust the app to select the ""fastest route"""
No sound notification of imminent speed camera. Seriously?!? Response to Waze: Not much use if the speed limit is different from that in Waze's database due to roadworks or incorrect data. Drivers don't drive whilst watching for a speed camera icon to appear. Most other apps provide audio warning regardless of speed. Please fix.
"Great GPS navigation app. Always correct info on speed limits, speed cams, hidden police, traffic etc. However, since the last update of Waze, the new voice recorder option was changed from default of Waze to the F-ing Google Voice Speach and it is a real BS. Totally making the good experience WORSE. Furthermore, before the last update Waze was able to find roads that were not visible in Google Maps and other GPS apps, now its even worse and can't find a simple location. 1/10 stars."
Has becoming more and more unreliable just because of the network problem. Devs keep on saying they fixed it but evidently it's still persists.
"Great app. I think there should be an animal in danger near the road report option, or a watch out animal near road report option."
"I've been using waze for a long time and I have realized some problems that if you fix, it would be much better. First is country borders, when I zoom out the map I can't see my country's borders and it is a little annoying . Second is ability to choose where to start. It would be wonderful if you improve these problems with new update. Thanks."
Many times lead wrong direction at the beginning.
Really loved this app. But after the update everything went haywire! It's trying to take me though non-existent roads.
The app freezes my mobile when launching through uber driver app on galaxy A32
"I love the accuracy of the maps a d the ability to share my ride, a d my children being able to share their ride with me, it takes a lot of stress off of me to know where they are in their travels."
The traffic updates and other reports are very useful. My biggest issue with the app is that if I want to look at the map I have to type in my password to unlock the phone. This can be very distracting while driving. I'm sure it is possible to add in a feature like Google maps where the app can be viewed without unlocking the device
"When it works properly, it's the most amazing app. When it doesn't, it gets pretty annoying. Voice commands stopped working all of a sudden, doesnt get addresses right sometimes and takes you to mysterious places. Good for finding cops and speedtraps, hazards, etc"
"It is a great app, but needs better functionality when using Android Auto. So many functions are missing when the app moves across to Android Auto, such as reporting limitations, no update map button, delays in traffic or reports from users, and just the basic reports you can submit using the app that you can't submit on Android Auto. Great functionality of alternative route ETAs live on the map will also be great. Sometimes it is shown, but it should be all the timeike Google maps."
"Overall great app, the fact that users can help each other is mind-blowing but there is sth wrong with the algorithm: it insists on taking you through the center of a city. Please improve that. I m 100% sure you that driving through the center of Paris is not the fastest way to drive from south France to Belgium. Similarly if i wanna go to lyon airport, please stop taking me through the Center. I do not wanna do sightseeing. Or at least add the option of avoiding towns and sticking to highways."
I love the Waze App! I don't drive anywhere without it being loaded on my phones display. Although it sometimes doesn't show the route I prefer I know I can head out on my drive and it will eventually concur with route I'm driving and display on screen. My favorite part of the app is the Alert of Road Hazzards in plenty enough time to look for them and not be caught off guard. Will WAZE have a HUD option in future? That's only thing that would make app better? üòÅ
"What's happened?! It no longer gives the best route in London roads. It used to be good for this and now I'll go a different direction against the suggested route and get a better time! I understand they've changed the speed limits on minor roads, but it's calculation for traffic is badly underestimated versus back roads. Over to Google maps for the correct destination time. Please fix!"
"Very good app. However, in the last update somebody decide to hide the compass and make it accesible only touching the screen. It makes the navigation a little annoying, specially for anyone using the app as a tool in daily work. Please, keep the compass on as a previous version. Don't fix a thing that is no broken!"
"This app used to be amazing but since requiring user profile, it became unusable. Glitchs everywhere, no way to create an account."
"Having given it a few months testing as an alternative to Google Maps I'd say it's not even close to being competition. The interface looks dated, Google Calendar address imports don't work for 'Planned Drives', it doesn't support Google Music or YouTube Music integration and favourites don't sync with Google saved places.  With Google Maps adopting more Waze features like speed cameras, incident reporting and speed limits on the way soon I can't see it being long before Waze just fizzles out or gets merged with GM."
"Used to be brilliant, recently just doesn't work. Position stutters freezing regularly which is no good if you don't know where you are. Takes ages to acquire network so you lose the smart features like routing to avoid traffic and reports. Help team offer little to support and fix. Hopefully they will fix and go back to the must have app it was."
"I have tried to use Waze so many times to no avails. The good things, customisation of icons to have a personality, speed camera shown on map and incident sourcing. The bad, the voice is weird compared to Google maps, constantly sends me through stupid back alley ways just because I chose no tolls? Google maps and Waze had completely different route for the exact same destinations. None of the optional route match either. So as a navigating app, it fails ignoring the ads no one clicks."
"The absolute worst gps app i have tried, i used it 4 times in 4 different cities and every time it sent me on a completely different location. Moreover the closest parking according to the app was so far away i had to take a bus twice. Never again no matter what jesus-blessed improvement they make."
"Don't understand the hype?? I downloaded it to give it a shot and holy cow!!....Is there enough ads? Way too many. Like others mentioned, ads covering blocks,locations,etc Makes it a little challenging to see where you have to turn sometimes. Big difference from Google maps. PS-my phone is fully up to date"
The voice portion stopped working
"Excellent app, thank you for developing this for all of us who like to travel. Can I asked that you put one more function on your map, let us know where we have data roaming and not, Please it will help a lot knowing where you have the best signal and not. Thank you and keep up the good job and everyone keeping the map updated."
"TWO MONTHS & NO RESPONSE OR REPLY FROM DEVELOPER! EVEN WORSE NOW! Honestly, the ONLY REASON why I use this app is for it showing where police are, & even then it's pretty hopeless as it only has a ""fixed"" spot the car can be marked, otherwise it's actually TERRIBLE üëé There needs to be an option to mark whether the police car was on move or whether it in fixed spot. There truly isn't enough character space for me to list every single that's wrong with this app"
"Several work colleagues raved about the Waze app. However, my experience has been appalling it's unreliable and not fit for purpose. I'm not sure if the fact that my work colleagues live in more densely populated areas is a factor, more data is able to be collected ü§î. Found it annoyingly frustrating, so Uninstalled"
"I think it's a bit dangerous that the Android auto version does not have a voice command option to stop active navigation. You have to fiddle with the interface manually to stop navigating. Also, offer a premium option already that allows me to opt out of ads."
it has very aggressive re navigation which is really good for avoiding traffic or road closures. It also shows cheap fuel spots. the fatal flaw of this app is that the little arrow that represents you on the map is about 5 or 10 m behind you in real life so you will drive past your turn without even realising it until it's too late and this makes it fundamentally broken as a navigation app and therefore I don't use it. Also it displays ads while you're driving so I uninstalled it immediately.
"(Pixel 6 pro user) I used to be an avid Waze user (Android auto) and would often suggest Waze to my friends and family. A few months ago, Waze just stopped working on Android auto. IF it loads the route, it will freeze part way, every single time. I've tried to uninstall/install, clear the cache, but to no avail. What gives!?!?"
Ever since I upgraded to Android 13 waze had been broken on Android auto. Screen remains on but in a dim state and you have to wsje the screen up for the phone to then turn off the screen. Also the speed camera bug where it stays on after you go past a speed camera. Then ceases to work again. Samsung s22 ultra.
"What a complete load of junk. Can't get into my account and it won't send a verification code to enter in the box which is a requirement. It just sends a click button verification which doesn't work.....should be renamed ""Clowns""......the developers need different employment......couldn't run a bath !"
downloaded this app as everyone said its better than google maps. initially I enjoyed it then got to realise it's very slow and doesnt navigate as fast as google maps which leads you to take the wrong exit or road. Also it does not update road closures and therefore takes you to them and then you have to figure out what to do next. Google maps shows Road closures and doesnt take you to them and gives you another route. I have now decided to uninstall Waze and go back to using Google maps.
"Broken. Navigating freezes regularly, making the thing useless when plugged in to my car's built-in display via Android Auto. This is not a phone or car issue because Google navigation works fine - and there are countless reports of the bug online."
Same issue as Google maps. I can't have the app open on my phone and on the car screen at the same time! I have a passenger! They can set it up. It's safe! This is the single biggest reason I am considering switching to iPhone. Because they let me have maps open at the same time as Apple car play! Who would ever have guessed Apple of all people giving their users more freedom than Google. Don't be evil is the company motto. Failing pretty hard I think...
"Looks good, but 1 very important info missing on the navigation page that is your destination. If destination can be show right from the navigation page without tapping its screen to searches for it, it will be a very useful app for delivery or passenger drivers."
"I love this app I've been using it for over three years and it is the best. This app keeps up with everything you need. Traffic, road side hazards, accidents, police, your speed. I recommend it to anyone traveling or just trying to learn your way around a new or unfamiliar place."
One of the better apps around and a good alternative to Google Maps when driving around. There are a few points that didn't exactly warrant the 5 stars: - App doesn't work that well globally (well that can't be helped) - App's map granularity is generally not that detailed (as compared to Google Maps) but - App may stop working halfway from time to time (but in general works well most of the time)
"I use it mainly with Android Auto, but it has the tendency to freeze on the current location of the car and never moves. I have to force stop it to make it work again. Ofcourse doing that while driving is very dangerous and stressful so I'm forced to switch to GMaps until this issue gets fixed."
This can be a really useful app but its doesn't always load usually in the morning when trying to get somewhere new..... saying cant finds gps signal but if go to another navigation app they are fine. I do prefer this one and use the most. Just wish I could relie on it more. Sometimes the bizarre 'short cuts' aren't as takes you off down the backstreets but then spend the saved time trying to rejoin the main route again.
"Well ive used waze for many years, I dont know what the hell the development team are doing but since the update where you cant join routes with friends it's gone downhill but I've stuck with it, not anymore, this app is a pile of junk now, it calculates incorrect routes miles out of your way, when you select another route, it completely ignores you and goes back to its original one, it consistently sends you straight into traffic jams then 2 to 5 mins after stopping announces heavy traffic!"
"Very useful for navigation & road alerts. It did help me figure routes that I haven't taken & other roads to travel. The downside here were the incapability to show map & navigation while offline, understanble for traffic news but at least make it accessible for those who has bad online connection. Overall, app is great & recommendable for private vehicles but can only be a little helpful for public transpo commuters just to check if they are on the right direction."
"The last update is the worst one, especially that there is no option to choose best time to leave in order to avoid traffic."
Hai waze. I'm a grab driver just want to know why lately waze got an error. Sometime it just a short distance but the waze cannot find the suitable way. Now it has a new problem always can't find a connection. Different with others apps it will find a way very quickly. Very disappointing & it become worst this lately. I have to change to another apps...sorry.
"Never fails, soooooo important to use just for the speed camera info"
I like the navigation in urban areas and the interface is one of the easiest in a lot of ways but I find it poor in rural areas. It seems to calculate the usage of country lanes in a really odd way that I've never experienced with other sat navs. I'm often driving in rural areas that I know it continually baffles me with the routes it constructs. If you could drag routes to amend this it would really help when planning.
"The app used to work fairly well but since updating my route keeps on rerouting every second and beeping so no journey can be made -having to use other apps when I've used Waze for years! Definitely an issue with the app as alternative navigation apps work fine and this issue is since updating. Also, it would be good if developers can add the 'van' vehicle option to allow national speed limits to be accurate for vans on A roads."
"I love the live speed indicator with the allowed speed that turns red when you go over and will audio warn you at a set amount over. Almost too busy display and no instructions really, but you figure it out fast. Gives good directions. I gladly use it as the main car navigation. It turns off if I get into a no signal place, but I have a hunch there's a way to have it keep going. Highly recommended."
Used to be awesome but now it constantly crashes how do I get the old version
"Lastest update erased my acct., Lost all my contacts. Tried logging in but says no acct. exist. Very upset, had to use Google maps."
"Tried to install latest version, kept crashing. Android phone kept telling me the app has a bug."
I've used waze for my delivery job's. The last two months this App been the absolute worse. It's just totally backwards upside-down going in circles crashing.iv done everything on my part to fix the problem. It's not a problem with my phone.its a problem you all created. Again I need a dependable GPS. Unstable waze.I Will be using Google Maps..
"Decent app, but even if you select a route without tolls it infuriatingly switches back to one with tolls."
I loved this app. Purchased it but now it doesn't work half the time. It tells me it is 28 miles away when actually it is 57 miles.
"geat app, It tells you everything you need to know as a driver or a passenger, it tells you if there's a Hazard, A crash, Police, etc... its very useful and super easy to use. also you don't have to touch or interact with it, it can speak and tell you where to go and if something is wrong on the road, and it supports so many languages, like SO many."
"The app no longer works since the 11/16 update (or thereabouts). It freezes, the widget is constantly spinning. Bring back the old version! I would like the option to provide a time tolerance when commuting between home and work when compared to a baseline route."
Same issue as described by others with Android Auto. Navigates for a few seconds then map screen freezes on car screen (as if car is not moving) but app does not 'crash'. Switch to google maps and works perfectly. Waze tends to not freeze if not navigating. Tried on s21 and s20 same issue. In my case is on Ford Sync 3 with latest updates. Tried in 2 cars with Sync 3 and same issue. Clearly Waze app issue. Only doing this since around the beginning of August. Fault not present prior.
Awesome app. Works flawlessly in New England and while using Android Auto. Just need bridge heights for a perfect app.
"A very handy app when you need to go somewhere but sometimes the GPS cannot be tracked and then it will cause some problems. And sometimes the route will change by itself for no reason (but it rarely happens nowadays). And furthermore, especially on KL roads‚Äìwhere we need to take the exact right streets to head to where we needed, may be very confusing‚Äì it does not help when the navigation app only tells u to go straight when there are many routes ahead of you."
"Usually works well. However it's really annoying to have results show up, but no directions available"
"Best of the Nav apps I've tried, which isn't saying a lot but I can definitely depend on Waze to get me out of a hole...4.5 stars"
"Will Amend score only used on one trip. I must say I appreciate the speed warnings as my electronics is a bit faulty, nice to have a real life engagement with a map and automatic alternatives whilst driving in case something unforeseen occurs. Pity I can use current location to set it as work because it seemingly is attempting to find a tourist destination near me to pin location."
Best navigation I just found. Love it!
"Waze keeps disconnecting from GPS and won't connect back. I have to turn it off and on again. But when it connects to GPS, it gives this unwelcoming message ""Something went wrong..."" Power cycling the phone doesn't help. Waze is practically unusable. NOTE: 2 stars and not 1 star because it worked literally once. That one moment, it was very helpful."
I was shocked at how much better this is than Google maps. I like that you can add Po-Po and other events to the map in real time.
"Getting tired on your ""uh oh"" and ""error searching network"" messages. It getting more frequent after update like everytime you used it. Even when these error seem resolved on screen, route displayed but not the road or traffic status. I hope the review is not just for your reading purpose but action instead. You used to be the best, don't turn your waze to waste pls"
"I've had so many issues with Waze using Android Auto on my Galaxy S10 5G in the past few months that I gave up using Waze. Waze kept either not GPSing correctly or didn't GPS at all, coming up with ""No network connection"" (yet my streaming music is playing correctly) and/or a blank white or black map. Tried multiple fixes but nothing worked and same issues occurred with different vehicles. Google maps doesn't have any of these issues"
"I have used waze app before and it was excellent and great experience really. But for more than 4 months this app stopped working in Sudan, it uses to give message of no network connection despite that the network connection is good and all the other network dependent apps are working normally. Me and many of my friends noticed that. We hope that this issue could be fixed soon and we could use waze again. Thanks."
"Apps can't use after updat, keep having error message of no connection. The app closed automatically after initialized."
"Keep LOSING GPS lock on ANDROID AUTO when the phone screen is off. No, it's definitely not my phone. It's not an old phone either (Samsung S10+). And I'm not the only one. And guess what? Google Maps works completely fine on AA. What's the point for a navigation app when you keep losing the GPS? WORKAROUND: In Android Auto (on your car screen) > switch to Google Maps > switch back to Waze > then Waze can get the GPS the whole way (because Google Maps is locking the GPS on background)"
"This app always showing no gps , when i use google maps gps are fine .. Better you guys move to google maps if waze not fix or improves this apps ."
"it was working fine few months before but after the update, keep getting server error, time out error. Was using it just now & selected the route with no toll. halfway on the road, waze route suddenly blank out which left me stranded. restarted the waze, selected the same route but it suddenly brought me to the toll route! Wasted my money & time. great ""job"" waze."
Wase & Android_Auto do not work properly. Speed is not shown on Waze&AA. Ford with Sync3.
No split screen feature in the updated andriod auto
"I loooove the abundance of settings, the alerts are mostly accurate however the map itself is not. Going to someones address lead me to Liberty Recycling which been there for long years but it shows on Waze as a road you go through. This GPS nav has yet to navigate me to a place correctly, only but a handful of restaurants which those somehow always accurate. Besides map itself being extremely out of date, there's the constant random mute on voice, in 1000 feet... and nothing, no turn left."
"No longer works for hazards (eg police). Despite police shown on the map, the police warning no longer appears when you're selecting the routes to the destination. Inconvenient/misleading. Edit: Both settings are on. And Waze is the only app that has major problem to connect to GPS. Even Google Map could. Didn't they bought you over? And I've seen this problem in a other's phones as well. Any updates to solve this chronic issue?"
The waze App it's really good for navigation in all ways you are going through. I'm using it in my Android device and it's okay for alerting you for anything ahead of you. Thanks for the app and I engarages all the Android users to download it.
Estimated commute times for motorcycles is wildly off. It adds about 15 minutes to a 30 minute ride.
"It's not working with Android Auto. It keeps zooming out and skipping, after freezes."
"What is wrong with you people, I stated there were no accidents there was no road work there was nothing your app threw me way of course it made me turn left when I should have turned right it got me off the parkway just to give me back on the parkway there was absolutely no reason for this these are my words don't change him around"
"Was great but like a number of users my app has gone crazy in the last few days with contradictory directions, thinking it's on a parallel road and telling me to do a u turn etc. Map editor said they weren't aware of any others with problems and to reinstall the app. Here I am to do just that and what do I see - loads of reviewers with similar problems. I plan to reinstall and try once more but if it's no better it's over to Google Maps for me!"
A terrible navigation app on par with Google Maps. When there's an incident on the roads these Maps just send you on the outskirts of where the incident was leaving you in total gridlock rather than being smart and sending you on a different route altogether. And when they say another route is quicker it is usually incorrect and takes even longer it says 9 minutes faster but then takes half an hour. Sat navs were better 10 years ago the old tom toms and garmin's so much better back then.
I love the waze app it is easy to use and gets me to where I want to go quickly. The alerts are spot on thank you fellow wazers.
"Great Waze app, awful Google Assistant! Back in time, Waze had it's own voice commands feature. The native voice recognition could perfectly recognize street names and addresses spoken in different languages. Then Google Assistant replaced that feature and it is just a disaster! That change was enforced without asking. After dozens of emails with the support team, there is no way to revert back from the ridiculously irrelevant Google Assistant to the good old ""Talk to Waze"" voice commands."
"1.has trouble finding some places that Google maps easily finds. Has shown me random list islands in the middle of the ocean sometimes. 2.stops giving directions when no wifi signal (although map for the area is loaded and on screen. Have had to stop and scroll and search frequently because of this. 3.no bicycle as transportation method is supported. So when I take my bike and need a little extra help this app doesn't help. Google maps supports bikes though, not sure why they don't."
"Unable to report police or other faults, also have the settings enabled to show speed, but nothing is displayed. Even after clearing data, and reinstalling. Samsung S20 ultra, with Android auto. Also been having issues with android auto just showing a white or black screen when Waze is enabled.. *Update* Sent a message and still no reply The development of this app is flawed. The response from users is more rapid then the development team. Been waiting support to help resolve app issues."
Went from five stars to one because the app went from very useful to almost useless. Recently to get Waze to work on any drive I have had to disconnect my phone from the car turn off Bluetooth force stop the app and clear the cache. If I don't Waze locks up intermittently and does not update the display. Definitely a Waze only issue as other Android Auto gps apps don't have any problem.
This is an excellent app. I wish they include Truck routes to this app. I'm a truck driver and adding truck routes to this app would be great.
"Like many other reviews on here since last update keeps loosing GPS location which causes multiple changes to directions and lots and lots of annoying beeps. I have done the GPS fixes as prescribed in help, also works well with Google Maps. This looks like a software bug, please sort and update. Thanks. When can we expect the update that fixes the GPS issue that seems to be effecting many users, last update was 1st August. Thanks"
"Was brilliant, recently it's gone mental. Keeps sending me on routes that I know are full of traffic. Only last Thursday it gave me an estimated arrival home of 1hr40mins, clicked routes this gave me a further 2 choices of 1hr55mins or 2hrs20mins. Turned it off and booted Google maps, low and behold 55mins staying on the first route waze gave me. I've totally lost confidence with waze over the past month. If it wasn't for the speed camera locations it'd be gone. No settings have been changed."
"After get location from other apps to Waze, will automatically choose fastest route which use maximum speed but I need shortest route instead high speed driving route"
The app used to show me a live feed of my progress and the speedometer and everything.. Now when I type in where I want to go Nothing Happens.. What is the use of this app if it's not showing me the route I need to be on.... Allot does is shows me where I am and not even that is correct... Maybe it works for other countries and other people but it's not working for me. I've been using this app for years What Happened? Ng
Ok.... so I passed the car on the side of the road..... 2 miles later I don't need to say if it's still there.
Great app... Only problem is that it doesn't support commercial vehicles. Please add an update for truck use.
"Such an amazing app, do much better than Google maps. The best part is that it has speed camera locations."
"Stopped using Waze after my third fine (yes, I know, I should have paid more attention) whlist following some obscure route and last straw; audio off-button has disappeared, instead there is volume zero, but audio instructions still appear you just can't hear them (music stops for it). However one more star as when motorway were shut, I was home on time"
Warns you of any delays on your route and helps with alternative routes
have tried this app a few times and find that it keeps searching for signal when Google maps works fine at the same time. Also the app keeps crashing when using it. I have gone back to Google maps as never had a problem with it. the idea that they have is good alerting other driver about things ahead but that's all.
"I would like to give more stars. But when your phone is in landscape mode or in Android Auto mode, there is no line for average speed control, nor sound from the end of trajectory control. When you set it to portrait mode, the line is on the left side and show the progress from the control. I think that a line on the top of the screen would be very helpful in landscape mode or Android Auto mode."
"Still not working on Android auto, keeps freezing! I'll come back in a couple of months to see if it's improved üëç"
App is very good should just improve on shorter routes
"Waze waz great.......ü§ï Everything was perfect, working well and clearly audible. All of a sudden the sound through my phone's speaker when on Waze went to minimum. Checked phone, speaker is working well. Checked Waze and all sound and voice settings are correct. Now the app is very quiet hence unusable. Google maps and other sat navs sound works fine. Please Waze, what is the problem with your app?"
"It's a feature-rich app but a SERIOUS drain on battery, plus makes the phone hot. No offline mode either, and it's constantly using your data, so it can show ads based on your location and route. Unusual search feature too, it doesn't have an option to set both start and end points, just the destination"
"Buggy experience. No way to turn off the stupid candy points and if you start the app without signal, the GPS never locks unless you reset the app. Edit in response to the ""comment"" It doesn't say no GPS. The application just doesn't move the pin from the starting point unless Waze is reset when cellular signal is available. GPS on the device works fine and there is no issue in google maps or any other app."
Little icon showers the display is better .
By far the most superior navigation app.
"I can't seem to change the settings to miles. Yes, I have researched how to do it but I cannot find General as an option anywhere. It is very clunky when switching from phone to head unit, I generally avoid it just using it in my phone instead of google auto. It is a real shame as the app has a lot of promise. I will persevere."
"The list is endless. GPS/network randomly lose signal while driving. Fonts shrink to unreadable sizes for weird reasons. Crazy algorithm which should prioritize routes based on ETA/traffic, somehow decides to always avoid highway even when the box is unchecked, then takes me through the worst roads. GPS positioning lags behind real time so that I already passed a turn/exit before noticing. And my favorite: having you drive long distance when your destination is right in front of you."
"Hope can improve the stability of the apps. Always no network connection, something went wrong, or some other errors. Seriously hope ur team can work harder on this issue as this causes a lot of inconveniences when in urgent or on the road. Thanks!"
"Works on my phone but not while using AA on my 2018 Ford Focus RS ... but Maps works just fine!! (Update).. AA auto starts on my phone (screen) Pixel XL with A11 OS. When using Waze the map will disappear but the navigation instructions will stay on the screen. I have cleared the cache and hard reset the app without any luck! A11 seems to have added more issues than new features that actually work correctly!! (NextUpdate) Hello, I tried to get to the Waz support (help) page and got a 404 error.."
"Waze use to be my go to GPS, due to the multiple route options, traffic feedback, red light camera warning, etc. However, in the last 2-3 months I have noticed Waze telling me to take unnecessary turns or roads when the usual back roads are flowing smoothly, and not providing accurate live traffic feedback. it also does not show the fastest way to some places anymore, sometimes it takes me on longer routes. also it likes to give me HOV options when I do not have such pass or meet the requirement"
It was good. now I am looking for a new app. Radar and other sound alarms work randomly so never rely this app hile you drive. I use it just because of beautiful interface but now even the map 3d zoom in and out feature while you navigate is not working good. It was great when everything work properly. Long long time ago.
"I had hoped that after moving from a Moto G4 on Nougat to a MotoG7Play and Android Pie, this app would stop crashing: it didn't. Pity, because the features are excellent. It's not good if it crashes every 100 miles and it neither responds to voice control nor restarts where you left off. I'll go back to plain old Google Maps for navigating, which doesn't crash......ever."
"Not particularly help esp in the early morning while you're trying to get to work, especially after youve punched in your destination it'll have difficulty trying to connect to whatever waze-backend via broadband to a point where it fails repeated, ""no network connection"" and ""no GPS showing your approximate location"", to a point I'll have to use google maps."
"Since last update Waze freezes or crashes and come back to main screen on my car stereo. Same happens on my phone except it crashes only and come back to main screen. As far the previous problem was annoying, this one is much more serious. Additionally I've noticed that Waze is getting slower with every update. It is very noticeable on devices with Mediatek CPU ( mine car radio). Update-all other nav software works ok (Google maps, Sygic, Navme)."
I would actually prefer this over Google maps if it's search function was better. With GMaps i can just enter my destination by voice (or type it) and the first result is the correct address. With Waze it gives me a whole bunch of results that i have to sort through to find the correct address. Not cool. Even with the correct destination it only takes me to the street not the numbered house. Also not cool. I hope you improve the search function so i can use Waze because the rest is great.
"This app is very useful for my job! I really love using it everyday. the only problem I encounter is when I pass a tunnel or I'm under the skyway it displays my location inaccurately, it guesses random wrong location and then update the route. Whenever this happens it annoys me coz it's giving wrong instructions repeatedly. Please fix this! I suggest that whenever the GPS link is cut coz of weak signal it must base it's instructions and resume where the last ""my location"" the GPS recorded."
"It was a very great App, but now is like a billboard when you stop the vehicle and you can't see the route correctly, lost lot of notifications of some speed cameras (I pass everyday near three that other apps notify but waze don't), and when you run out of signal is completely useless (why we can't use offline maps), please take this feedbacks as possible ways to improve, thanks"
"The only thing I can think of to improve is mitigating multiple cop reports when the cop is on the move. Yes the cop is ahead, but they're driving so you'll get the first report and then someone ahead sees them and you get another report, etc."
"Great navigation. Very accurate. Shows all ptoblems, traffic and hazards on the roads. People can comunicate between each other by leave notes, photoa and reports of the traffic situation. Best app I have try so far for getting from point A to point B safe. Only trusted users can share information and everyone can confirm, cancel or give more information about a car crash, stopped vehicles, havy traffic, bad weather or any other thing that may get on your way. Can be used together with Spotify."
"Way too buggy for a google product. Although it has better features I will stick with Google Maps. I like the speed and alert notifications. However, I saved my home, work and a few other favourite addresses several times and they kept disappearing. Created an account and it never stays logged on, etc. using Galaxy S9+ 256gb."
Room for improvements: Lack of lane display similar to Google map. Police notification etc are not accurate anymore as users seem to have lost interest in reporting. Traffic data seems to be less accurate as before !!! For little time saving you are often taken to bendy and very urban areas. Reporting while driving is very unsafe and prone to accident. Average speed zone check areas need to be inspired by that of tom-tom showing the average speed in the zone.
I have been using Waze for a really long time now. Lately I have been using it with Android Auto which worked even better. However since a couple of months it loses its gps location while driving? It goes all over the place or just doesn't update at all. When I switch to Google Maps it works fine again so it is not a GPS problem. It has to be in Waze. Do you guys have any idea what the hell is going on? I love the traffic updates and it has helped me out a lot of times where I have to take a weird route only to find out later that there was an accident or traffic jam or my normal route. So if the GPS is working correctly again I would really recommend Waze. Not with the current problems I am having.
"For the first year or so I grew to really appreciate the additional features compared to Google maps. However, for the last month it has stopped working with android auto and simply freezes my in-car screen immediately so that I cannot even end it and switch to another app."
"I've been using Waze for one week and so far I love it. It's helped me save a lot of time and money for fuel. Only reason I rank Waze for 3 stars is due to not having lane assistance. This is extremely important and I've noticed that the Waze community has been requesting it since 2010! When developers don't listen to their customers, I typically go back to the better option. (I'm a OnePlus 5T user)"
"Good idea and have great features but they are most of the time semi accurate. Example: speed camera few km away from me, well you get alert when you are approaching from behind, but won't when you are coming from where camera is pointed, when I see first camera is flawed how can I trust when I come across one somewhere else. Why don't you just have camera alert, no matter whichever direction it's facing. And speed limit is accurate in 60-70% of the time, big margin for error."
"Routes have been either inefficient or stupid. It's not outsmarting traffic anymore, but finding alternative routes to enter the same traffic area you were hoping to avoid in the first place. There are times it strays me from the usual path to which when I refuse and stick to the usual route, it recalculates and tells me I'll arrive earlier. If it doesn't have traffic data on alternative roads, you won't be routed there, even if it's wider and empty, it will still choose the usual traffic-laden"
"One of the latest updates has an issue with Android Auto. I play waze Information through my phone's speaker even while connected to the car. The latest update stopped that from working so i had to go back 3 previous versions to get it to work again. while the radio is on, the sound would dim slightly while waze was announcing a direction to take, or a warning like object on road ahead. after one of the previous few updates, that function stopped working. only works if playing google play music."
"I love waze, more adaptive to current situations than Google & great warnings but as a prev reviewer said, would be helpful if they were repeated, even once. Latest update caused issues - select a destination & it searches for a route but then goes back to the general map of your current location without a route & when you try to select destination again - nothing - the map just defaults. VERY frustrated! Update: as per Peter A review- also having GPS connect issues, restarting app fixes it."
"Lately I've been getting an error message when selecting my saved commute journey, so I can't use the app. In the past it has been hit and miss. Some days you'll get excellent diversions then on other days you'll be directed into stand still traffic. Traffic/road work updates hit and miss too."
"Have tried to use this app many times. Have gone into settings to open, install and re-installed but still won't work for me."
"I like the app as it is user friendly and easy to use, however as of late it's been giving terrible directions; unnecessary and really weird diversions and reroutes. The ETA will recalculate after the reroutes (which always involve getting OFF of a major highway and normal route) are ignored and will often be 15-30 minutes shorter over only a 1 hour drive. Not sure what the deal is but I'm going to have to stop using Waze at least for a couple months until this is fixed."
"WHY DO YOU HAVE TO ASSIST ME WITH GPS, THEIRS NOWT WRONG WITH MY PHONE IT'S YOUR APPLICATION! - Still loses GPS after 3 YEARS at least PATHETIC"
"It's a great navigation app unfortunately, the last update deleted all my personal settings & saved locations."
"Absolutely a life saver something I would pay for yearly if it would tell you slow down and when cleared ,to speed up again lol üòÜ üòÑ üòâI am asking for a lot but New York is becoming a place where you can't enjoy any more ,you cannot even get up and go without being slowed down . I still don't understand why my car can go so fast ,but where can I open it up at. Any way your app is fabulous excepts lately it takes me in circles, I guess the government is trying to block it .Thanks again"
Good up but I can't log into Waze on my work phone. You get a link that opens gmail - I can't sign into my gmail on work phone. why can't they just be a simple password or an actual code you type in.... pretty stupid tbh.
"Keeps saying I have no Internet connection when all my other apps work fine. Already uninstalled, clear data and cache but still doesn't work"
"Used to really like it but it has been WOEFUL recently. It will often tell me a journey will take 30 minutes but having just completed a ""38 minute"" journey in nearly 2 hours I can safely say it isn't tracking things properly (the incident had been going for well over 2 hours by the time I set off so changing traffic conditions not relevant in this case). It also gets confused where I am a LOT of the time which means the route is muddled, which isn't useful when you need to get somewhere."
It's hard to understand why you can't pre download maps for certain zones with bad data coverage. That would be a great improvement. Also a better management for the saved points and the possibility to export them and share them easily.
"Great navigation app with many necessary features. However, it would be nice to be able to move parts of the interface, such as the speedometer, as my phone mount is in a position where the bottom left corner of the screen is blocked. If this could be added, I see no faults."
"Buggy... the purple directional line falls under the road and is not visible or just pixels through the textures. Changing the orientation fixes for a couple of minutes, in short, it‚Äôs not realistic to use the app in the city with such bugs, I constantly miss turns."
"1 star for the way to add your current location easily, in an obvious way! And horrible way to try and edit it afterwards. You need to research online how to do these basic tasks if you're not a frequent user. Come on Waze it's not that difficult designing an intuitive app is it??? Ps. Apart from that it is a good app"
"Good app with bugs. Sometimes the app will just close after driving for a while. The battery saving feature where the screen is meant to dim doesn't really work well. When opening the app, after selecting the destination, it says 'oh no, error calculating rout'. Otherwise good app."
"3 because of the street names language cannot be changed. It's even worse, when you're trying to search for some address, and Waze gives you suggestions... In local language, which you obviously don't understand. I'm the same time Waze is a very nice navigation app."
"Everytime I run waze it always freezes and says ""just a sec"". The app does not function."
"1. Not opened the app They got my locations in the background, i wish i can get your best woman, filthy devs DO IT FULL OFFLINE PLEASE"
Not the optimal route. Not sure how they update the route but I was stuck in traffic for hours but there was a more optimal route
"This app used to be my go to but, it hasn't worked with Android Auto for the last month. The icon just spins."
"Great App for drivers and navigators. 1 suggestion is to indicate exactly which lane/s the driver should take to make a turn at junction or exit/enter highways. 1 issue i have been facing and even submitting debug log has not fixed it: incomplete voice direction. It will tell me ""in 500 meters...."" but doesn't not tell me to turn left or right after 500 meters. Hope this can be fixed by 1 day..."
"Wish it were easier to report map corrections, such as which lane is blocked by disabled vehicles or roadworks, posted speed 'limit' errors or changes. Also, when a redlight cam AND a speedcam 'overlap' each other's territory, it'd be nice to be able to select which warning takes precedence (speedcam, please, in mine?) Otherwise, waze is freaken indispensable."
Takes you a lot of times through traffic with a lot of extra time a well. Times goes down If I don't listen and take another route
Waze is OK and warns of speed cameras. But the route choice sometimes is idiotic. I know the areas I'm driving in well and Waze oftentimes selects routes that are in the wrong direction. Using little roads instead of the most obvious choice despite no traffic. Simultaneously checked with Google Maps and it beggars belief. Otherwise it's a decent app
"Installed on the newer phone there is no map. Tried this and that, still no map. Then, installed it on the much older phone(old android OS), there is the map, but no sound. Again tried many options in both scenarios from various suggestions/solutions on the internet. I'm uninstalling. I need the map and sound for cameras. Bought a GPS that sorts the problem out wonderfully. Started paying back for itself today"
Used to be great. Now it can't be trusted to get an accurate route - takes long and unnecessary routes and lacks the intelligence to accept or adapt when taken on a more direct route. Instead it stubbornly insists on a u-turn in order to get you back on the long route! Frustrating. Quarter to deleting the app!
Very easy to use. Good direction
"Great driving experience, except the voice does not come over the radio loadenough to hear it clearly."
"While I am sure Waze considets opup ads that plaster over important content improve the chances of getting ""eyeball"" time from drivers, they are distracting when driving. Worse, many are ads for chain reataraunts nearby that I hate going to, and there is no way that I can see to get rid of them. This ""feature"" seems to be fairly recent as I do not recall seeing it a few.years ago. Uninstalled it.as, to be honest, these popup ads are so distracting they are a safety hazard."
Very good but somtime roang an loang so problems An one week theis app not good
"Pretty useless on Indian roads. Most of time times it shows that ""something went wrong"" while looking for the route. Even if it is managed to provide the route, it shows most unoptimised route, as many roads and diversions are not updated in the app. The ETA is ridiculously away from reality. Thus I've been using waze along with Google map for more than 6 months in a hope that it my pickup the routes and update. But I surrender today and freeing up my space."
Two recent changes have made the app far less user-friendly and helpful: (1) The option to turn off map auto-zoom has been removed. (2) the option to turn off voice directions (whilst retaining sound for speed camera alerts etc) has been removed. Why did they think this around be a good idea?
Love this app for my private vehicle but is not useful for my commercial vehicle. There is no option to set my vehicle as a commercial vehicle as many of the areas I travel in have highways/roadways that have commercial vehicle restrictions and it is always trying to take me onto those roads. And update with this option would be great.
"Its a Great app, but sometime it will hit you badly when you need it the most. Lately i have been experiencing that GPS tracking is lost and there is a message on top that internet connection is lost while internet is working fine. I have to restart my phone to make it work again which is very annoying and troublesome. Hope the administrators solve this issue. üôè"
"I've used it since day one as my only GPS app and got rid of others, even recommended it as a trusted app with my company( I run an event company). This past weekend Waze took my guests on a huge circle which cost them to lose 90 mins off the commute. I've noticed that more and more over the last 2 years the accuracy has gotten worse and others I know are saying the same thing. I now am forced to use Google Maps as my trust in the app has diminished."
"NEIGHBORHOODS ARE NOT SHORTCUTS. I SHOULD NEVER BE SENT THROUGH A NEIGHBORHOOD ON ANY NAVIGATIONAL ROUTE EVER. *Even if there's road closures or construction, neighborhoods are not meant for road traffic."
"Worked OK initially, but then intermittently lost GPS and didn't know where it was. I use it with Android Auto which continues to work well using Google Maps with no GPS issues. I seems to me that the GPS issue is with Waze. I note that there are many other reviews stating similar problems. The developers should investigate and fix these issues because Waze is a good concept if it worked properly."
Buggy. App crashes on certain features. Refresh horrible. Single Sign On loaded with issues.
"Good app but the red light traffic camera notification is incredibly annoying and I can't turn it off. It takes up a portion of the map at the top of the screen and I have to click it to get rid of it, not a good idea while driving! If u run a red light that's my problem, I don't think it's necessary for you to tell me so please remove this and let me see the whole screen! Also, a paid version would be great as I'm sick to death of seeing adverts while I'm at a stop light, again, I have to click the screen to get rid of them and I'd rather see the map to know where I'm going after the light turns green."
"Its avoiding high ways even if it's turned off,tried to uninstall it but still, I think the passes option it's the problem"
"Loved using Waze on my phone but since upgading my car I now have android auto and Waze is now freezing regularly, today as an example it froze making me miss my turning then froze twice after redirecting me back to the turning I missed"
"Had the app for a few months. With the ability to mark roadworks etc is good. However you can only report on the route you are travelling, so if a road is close off a junction you pass you can't report it. The update for music integration has ruined it, cannot connect with Spotify anymore."
"When using Waze through android Auto, my phone has to be set to vibrate. If my phone's ringer is switched on, every 3-5 seconds the audio of whatever I'm listening to cuts out for a second or so. Fairly annoying. Waze on Apple Carplay is also much better to look at and easier to read compared to Android Auto."
"This app has given me nothing but problems for the last 2 months. I have been travelling a lot and desperately needed GPS. Waze was constantly losing connection, blacking out on the dashboard, not remembering the routes, etc. I nearly missed a flight because of the issues I was having."
Effective but sometimes can't connect to GPRS.
"Until 2 months ago I thought this app was amazing. It would always find the quickest rat run to my destination and advise of pot holes, police & cameras etc However, since October I have been directed to motorways & carriageways that have been closed with no reroute or alternative option. You are given the option to add a road closure but to the benefit of other Waze users. It's annoying when Waze tries to reroute you back to road closure. This happened last night on the A31 coming out of Poole."
"Great for drivers. The best driver app. Could be better with small tweaks. The searching could be better, Google maps has a better search. Sharing drives with others and seeing them on the map live would be good. Being able to talk to my shared drive drivers (like a walkie talkie) would be good. Save categories of locations like GMaps would be good. Miss the 3 finger swipe to activate assistant (voice is hard when using music or on phone etc). Maybe a dashcam mode? Idk"
"cuts out constantly, gives wrong directions, takes you far out of the way to go through extra tolls, freezes and won't close or restart when you make or recieve a call, disregards what you search and just directs you to a different place, doesn't have roads updated so sends you down dead ends or takes the long way, can't figure out how to turn around so it will instruct you to drive for 50km's until there is a roundabout, does save you from the occasional fine."
The app is on the money great app. Thankxs for keeping it simple üòäüôè
"The app is great and useful. Except for the pop up of undownloaded voice. It's disruptive, and cause trouble by requiring you to press the button for its removal. Please, make the download manager more capable, or at least, make that pop up time limited. Thank you. I put 1 star because of the pop up. 5 stars, when it's fixed."
"Works well, mostly intuitive user interface. Limited to only connecting w. friends through Facebook, boo:( App has an annoying bug: all notifications result in suppressing audio of other apps running synchronously that produce media (sound) : however this also concerns any type of waze-notification that doesn't even HAVE an audio. This results in severe disruption of e.g. Spotify music, Audible listening-books etc. when taking turns, passing a speedcam etc. Please fix this! :)"
"After about 10 updates and over half year, waze finally started to work with network connection. Unbelievable. Befote it wasnt able to connect even with unrestricted access. Pity it uses google maps app as background map loader, it doesnt work without it. Also requires google services."
"Ya overall good, but when i have important occasion, this app always bring me to the road with worst traffic, all resident at that area know we should avoid that road but this app still bring me there"
"After update to this 4.47.0.3 version on my phones, always keep searching network shown while using the app, and it also have problem when checking the routes. Previous version was better than this version! This issue happened in my 2 Android phones. Please do something with it. I love to use this app while traveling around daily."
"Routing can be pretty poor at times, and doesnt always send you the quickest way. Voice commands are woeful, no interlocks when in menus so when trying to report traffic it often tries to change my destination! Would love the ability to allow toll roads only if saving X minutes of a journey. Ended up buying a tomtom."
"This used to be my nr 1 app, I use it like crazy. But since a week now, it doesn't show anymore the speed cameras, on the map or the usual audio notification... Is it something changed? Cause if so there's no reason to go back to Google maps. The one feature that made it great app was the speed camera notifications"
"great app, but the amount of bugs makes it painful to use. Some examples: - manually changing camera angle feels weird and behaves weird. - Inability to add friends, when trying, gives an unspecified error message (uh oh - something went wrong). - Cant see iOS users even when carpooling. - username generation is broken, displays 'nickname is already taken' while it is not."
Works well as long as you don't run into an unreported closed road. For some reason it is not possible to report a road as closed through the Android Auto interface so the singular most important use case of a community driven navigation app is unavailable for anyone using the service through Android Auto.
"Very good app. But could be better as a navigation app by reduce or even removing multi-language voice-navigation; use English-only voice so make app smaller, and have more on-the-road information (such as Gas Stations, traffic lighted intersections, one-way roads guide, etc) rather than multi-language voice navigation. Overall very nice navigation app"
I never had issues and adore this app but it keeps freezing when I connect to my car and I can't use it at all.
"Really like the concept of this app, but it is too buggy. Especially the way it is the unchangeable default for calendar location and how the integration with assistant does not include the street number."
I was using it from a long time but after the last update it's not good because it shows you the lines so late now. Other things are good.
"Waze, once my favourite navigation app is falling apart. My fiance lets me know every day when she leaves for work and I could see her route and where she was. Now her ETA is always wrong. Can't see her route, and no idea where she is. The routes are not even reliable. Now I am looking at other navigation apps."
"App is yet to be super refined. Animations are okay but seem sluggish at times. I have a constant message on overhead saying ""waze preparing navigation voice 0%"", when when I have a active internet connection and have the app on for 2 hours. Traffic features are very useful but google maps is copying everything from Waze and unfortunately seems to do just as well if not better. Have loved waze for a long time and the community that uses wze are way more actuive on actually posting road updates, so it is sad to see people leave waze to Maps. Waze also needs a dedicated android auto Interface as the current one is somewhat lackluster and hard to use espeicall the side hamburger menus for favourite and planned drives. Overall, useable, if you like waze. If you just want a map with no hassle, Google maps seems to be in the lead this year."
"Pretty good app all around. Gives more precise or feasible turn by turn directions than the Uber app, whose Maps are often outdated by years and never really show local construction. Also, while Wake gives audible turn by turn navigation, the latest version of Uber fails to do this and is, therefore, less useful by far."
"This navigation software is very useful for taking into account traffic and adjusting routes. It occasionally seems to miss very heavy build ups of traffic but not often. It's 100% better than the inbuilt navigation in my car. It sometimes says my GPS is not connected, when other apps which use GPS work fine, so I think there's something not quite right in the software there but hard to get to the bottom of."
"Inacurate traffic volume (its shows red but in reality there is no traffic after all), inacurate roadmaps, need improvements on user flow and UI. Not that intuitive. Slow to start or initialize, it shows searching for network but the device has good data and wifi connection. Needs additional route options not limited to three(3) options. Very very very inacurate."
"Paid user with 1 year experience with Waze app Positive: It works when you open up app in town with internet available, no problem. Nightmares: it doesn't work when you're trying to open the app out of town without internet available. It's dumb move and huge bummer. The app just show blue screen and then crashes.. you're just a sitting duck in the car with dark outdoors. If you're planning to drive long distance without restarting phone or accidentally closed app, this app is for you."
"I use this app while being abroad, so I can see the remaining time and distance to my destination. I would like to see the state/country borders for my future navigation. And with that being said, I must say that if that was added, this would be a perfect navigation. And also I have expirinece with this app, from when I used it to help my father navigate through unknown places."
"The early notifications about taking 2 or 3 lanes to take a turn is very helpful. The reporting about obstacles on the road is greatly appreciated. We need voice commands to report similar accidents or road closures etc., because we can't use the phone's keyboard while driving. Voice commands also would be useful if we need to change the routing or destination while using the app."
"2016 chevy Cruze, gotta have phone plugged in but wont come up on car screen, 2 use app... only spotify. I've tried updating, I am updated in app..."
"This is amazing it has gotten me out of sticky situations on multiple occasions. It will take you to back roads get you to your destination faster and overall is better for travel. The map is easy to tell where you are going and it is not confusing like Google Maps. This deserves over 5 stars, great app."
"Hey Guys the app sucks, Maybe its a good app as far as North America is concerned, but the maps of my city are at least 6 months old.The route being shown is over bridges that have since collapsed and routes which I take does not show a road where one does exist. The app has lot of potential, but then it has to be relevant for it to be effective.Do inform me when u guys put your act together, would love to be part of the team."
Wanted to select a scenic route but wouldn't allow. Kept overriding my choice with fastest route.
Almost there! But I use Pocket Casts for my podcast consumption. It's the only thing missing right now.
"Loved the app until it stopped working on Android Auto one day during a drive. Now it fails to show the map. Works fine on the phone. Google maps works fine on Android Auto. Tried all suggestions. Reinstalled etc. No map shows in the car. Phone is Nokia 7.1, with Android 10, car has Ford Sync 3. I've now given up on this."
"Used to be good now it's absolutely garbage, it keeps thinking I'm going backwards constantly rerouting my path and blocking the entire screen with idiotic ads for car repair and fast food while driving. Couldn't have caused an accident or missed a key turn. I don't effing want ads. You've lost me because of this."
"The app. Was working perfectly. After the last update it fails to read the network. I thought that there may be something wrong with my phone, so I installed again as new on another new phone, but experienced the issue, not reading the network. Up to date Aug. 12th, I am still suffering with the application. I submitted the issue to Waze support team and I am waiting for their reply. To day 31 Aug. 2020, I uninstall the program and installed again. But still not reading the network connection."
"Well, I thought it was going to work on my 2nd try with it, but Im going to have to delete it. Laggy, bugs, and 85% of the time, took me to the wrong place"
The app is incredibly buggy and unusable at the moment. It's a shame because it's supposed to be great for avoiding traffic but it's so poorly designed that I can't even open the app without it crashing. I've tried uninstalling several times and I now I can't even get past the login page because it crashes as soon as it wants me to verify my email. Hope they fix this soon but until then it's not worth the hassle.
12/20/22 - app had an update today and now nothing will load!
"So, if you want to find were is a traffic on Manhattan or get around to all downtown Brooklyn, you must have this perfect tool. More then stupid app!"
This app is not user friendly. We were traveling near Atlanta but the route the app wanted us to go was twice as long. I couldn't change the route. I thought this app gave you the best route. Very disappointed! I'm sticking with Google! Also the arrival times do not take into consideration time zone changes. I don't see why people like this app. I tried using the alternate route but it only gives you one street at a time. If I‚Äôm in an area I don‚Äôt know this app is the wrong one for finding the best route!
Unnecessary mileage added with every journey. I have noticed that with every journey it takes the longest route. Last week I was only 6 mins away from destination but then was rerouted to 20 mins. Although I didn't want to change my route but there was no option to cancel new route. It was not the first time. Therefore I am uninstalling this App.
"Some people are able to advise for vehicle on side of road, road kill etc, those options are not available on my app."
"Google bought this app and is killing once was a GREAT navigation app. A constant ""searching"" for internet or GPS connection even though other apps are working fine. Very frustrating! Why do we need to constantly clearing cache, data or reinstalling it every time the app encounter an issue? Too many bugs and the rating shows I am not the one who are annoyed and frustrated with Waze. Time to say goodbye!"
"Awesome when it works, horrible when it doesn't. Waze has been a great app so far until the app stops receiving my GPS location even with the correct settings. I have encountered a few incidents where the app stopped calculating my route and I am forced to stop by the side of the road to fix it but eventually I am unable to. Hopefully a fix to accurately locate our GPS will be updated soon because it is sometimes frustrating if it stops working during our drive."
Avoids traffic by rerouting and uses user added aids to identify emergency vehicles and obstructions. App is just amazing. Thank you.
I have been using waze for years.. Something has changed in the algorithm over the past 2 years and is no longer effective.
"For the 2nd most used GPS app, I feel it is still very amateurish. Really annoys me that when I turn my phone off after loading my pre planned drive location, the app restarts again. I created a profile and used it but now I can't login, always has error messages. None of the support team get back to me. Waste of time"
"This is for the current version only.Previously very happy with it.Latest version is simply broken while using android auto, constantly thinks I'm stationary so won't go into 3d view with the car icon, very slow to respond, speedometer no longer appears as it thinks I'm stationary, as such no speed camera or road hazard warnings. Tried deleting the cache and deleting the app, still doesn't work right! Why ""update"" things and make them WORSE! Gone back to using the cars sat nav VERY disappointing"
"I want to rate this higher, but the biggest and most dangerous issue is the speed. The box is a decent size on Android auto, but the speed hovers in TINY print in the center and you can't really see it. It's almost caused an accident trying to read the small print. Better utilize the space! Other than that, the app is pretty good."
"Really important feature missing from the android auto version, where we can't indicate a road is closed along a route, to get rerouted. It's available when on mobile. A little dangerous because it means i have to unplug the phone, open it on the device, set the road closed and then reconnect to the car."
"Brilliant, accurate and easy to use"
"Needs an update, speed camera freezes don't leave screen"
This used to o be a five star app. It's gone downhill considerably. Ads block your screen and pop up constantly taking your eyes from the road. Navigation has gone to garbage. Don't know what happened with the algorithms but they used to be top notch. Not anymore. Voices cut in and out. Have so many steps to report hazard now that you become a hazard yourself if you attempt to do so. Please correct these so the app is worth using again. Additionally address negative reviews. Not only positive.
"A good app overall. What I think it's missing is the ability to choose and add a favourite address directly by pinning it on the map, and another thing it's missing is a summary at the end of the trip (route on map, total distance, total time, total pauses etc)"
Constantly freezes. Impossible to use.
"I like the app but because it freezes all of sudden in the middle of the road, it makes my travelling dangerous. Previously it was not the case but now it first tells me to go towards one direction and after a while switches me to completely another direction. It is very dangerous and should be taken legal action if continues as such. Please fix it."
"it has the potential to be a good app but I've now uninstalled it after it showed slow traffic not on the main road where it was, but going round and over farm land back down to the front end of the slow traffic?? How do I know it's wrong well it was just down the road from where I live so I do happen to know its a bit out of sync with reality, be careful of this app it's not accurate...."
Please fix the AA coolwalk display issue in split screen
"I'm not sure which update broke Waze, but it has a lot of problems at the moment. Mainly: 1) Whenever I start a route for the first time it keeps saying 'Waiting for network'. i have to restart the trip once or twice before the time and distance are both showing. 2) I cant plan trips anymore. The screen that used to show estimated times in the future is broken."
"Dear Waze team, what's wrong? I absolutely adored the waze navigation and used it for over a year, but WTH now the traffic information is inaccurate: massively used main roads that have been blocked for maintenance( more than a day)still are shown as free for use and resulting congestion is shown way to late and NOT avoided. over the last three days and three major trips I have lost a great of time with this app(1 1/2 hours). 1 month ago 5 stars. Now 1.5 Stars. Hope I can come back to you soon!"
One of the last app updates has changed the visual placement of the indicator for the next exit. The next exit used to be always largely visual...now it is a tiny icon in the upper right corner of the screen. When you need to see at a glance what the next action or move is....this is greatly inconvenient.
"Awesome app, much much better than Google maps .. Beautiful interface, premium looks, shows routes where traffic is less, lots of voice guidance options, lots of good features.. Kudos to the developers, pls keep up the good work.. One request though.. Pls add an option in waze to only stick to main roads while navigating, bcos some times its takes me thru weird shortcuts, alleyways.. Where the roads are horrible."
Waze only gives one route option whereas google maps provided three for the same departure and destination locations. It's also lacking an ability to edit the route to make changes to avoid certain areas. These 2 issues make the app useless to me. Updated: it also shuts down randomly. I'll stick with Google.
"I'd switch to Waze if only it had offline mode like Google or a way to download or at least use less data as an option. especially if there is no signal in the area. other than that, I like the UI and layout of the gps map and the colors and icons which make it more intuitive to use."
"I've been using Waze for years and it really worked fine until last update on December 2019. Since then, I wasn't able to use the app properly. I was always routed to unknown roads and I kept on losing. It always says, ""no gps detected"" and the likes. Most of the time, couldn't detect traffic unlike the old waze, always consistent that you can rely on it. I hope this will be fixed soon. By the way I am using oppo f9, maybe it'll help for the next update. üôè"
"App worked great for over a year. Then... I mapped my AM trip, it shows 51min and some weird route. There's no traffic so I ignore and risk it. Made my own route. The entire way it keeps re-calculating. With each defiant move I make, it shaves off a few minutes. I arrived in 36min. Second time it's happened so I'm never using it again. If this is a glitch in the system, a known issue, or a setting I need to fix please inform me so I can change this review back to a 5-star."
"Ever since the latest update the app just stopped working. Whenever i connect to my androidauto they keep prompting me that i have not setup the app and kept asking me to ""set-up"" before i could use. After goimg through the ""set-up"" all my previous settings were gone and have to go through all the ""set-up"" and settings every single time i connect to my car."
Waze used to be great but it's recently started taking some horrendous routes and spectacularly underestimating how long journeys will take. It's also started doing everything it can to take me though the London congestion zone despite being set to no tolls. Using it is now a stressful experience. Google maps on the other hand is way better than it used to be so I've made the switch.
"Everytime I put an address in, the route is unavailable. After putting the same address in countless times, it finally finds a route. I try to check for traffic on the 'plan a trip' and its unavailable. I've heard great things about this app, but my experience hasn't been good let alone great."
"Not liking the new update. First thing in the morning I turned on waze...it'll automatically choose where I want to go, the way it was setup. Now I have to choose where to go. And the arrows are confusing, when its telling you where to turn off the freeway..with multiple arrows...an exit before you really need to exit"
"Whilst the app isn't bad the support/web site around the app is not as helpful as it might be for people evaluating the product... Also:- * Cannot submit feedback to the 'main' website without an account * While a voice 'type' can be selected, there is no preview available of the voice * There should be options to set an alert at a point *before* the speed limit is reached * The interface is not particularly clear; sometimes a swipe from the left edge doesn't actually bring up the info/settings page. Thanks."
"This is a greater sat nav- I particularly enjoy the choice of navigator voice (batman was my favourite - please bring him back, but to stay this time!). Routes are easy to follow, voice instructions give plenty of notice to make any manoeuvres. HOWEVER, since the last update the app won't load properly/ will repeatedly load & crash/ will say I'm offline when I'm not and stop working. So right now, my waze is pretty useless üôàüò¨"
"Poor App. Not showing all roads. Even bigger roads are not shown in map. Also, not showing shortest routes. Get confused many times while driving on a straigt road. On signals asking vehicle to turn left/right rather than going straight. And worst part, no feedback can be given after journey about the navigation experience. No doubt Google Maps is much better and reliable app. Waze is exiting due to colour combination Nd graphics but not at all reliable."
"Since the Mayor decided to extend the congestion charge I have noticed Waze now gives the toll option only - even if you have it on your settings to avoid any charge!? So back to Google Maps as we still get the free route. Really disappointed and will no longer recommend to others. Don't bother with this app anymore, seems like they have sold out."
"It's a very useful apo but i've been trying to use it in my new android phone and the app won't be opened and stays in ""Just a sec"" state"
"So the positive is I love the 'social' concept of the app where drivers can report issues on the road to one another and even do neat things like thank one another. This aspect is so unique and cool its hard for me to walk away from Waze completely. That said I'm not sure if I'm atypical or what, but I use Waze primarily on Android Auto and this is where my issues mainly are. For instance I note that if you use the app directly on your smart phone device you get every basic feature you could want in a GPS app. You can search for end points by business type (gas station, food etc), there is integrated google search available from standard search bar where, I'm told you can even report traffic conditions with voice. You can't do any of that on the Android Auto version of the app. With the AA version of Waze you only get access to the basic search bar if the parking break is active (at least in my '06 Town and Country with Panasonic double din radio installed). This search bar only lets you type in what destination you want, it won't allow for category searches with a simple tab of the button (ie as you can do with a TomTom or Google Maps with extreme ease). There is also no direct integration with google voice, meaning while you can ask google voice for destinations and have it hand off to waze (ok, but wait a sec on why this remains a problem) you absolutely don't get to report traffic conditions with voice. Now not affecting my overall rating but certainly compounding my issues with waze are the following: - Activating google voice at all frequently causes the app to start flashing black and not infrequently causes it to totally crash. - Waze is particularly sensitive to changes in network conditions, IE it's VERY bad at switching from wifi to 4G for instance. - Task switching to many common AA apps (Sirius XM for instance) can cause Waze to either simply forget you have a destination inputted effectively cancelling your navigation, or, again, cause the app to crash. - Frequently when waze does lose network it loses so hard you have to unplug from AA and kill all open processes in order to make sure Waze starts fresh I'm not basing my rating on these issues because I'm actively working with waze support to debug some of this. Having said that lets say for arguments sake waze support totally resolves all technical glitches with the app. That still leaves Waze just insanely nuetered even compared to the experience you have directly on the phone screen and certainly compared to just launching google maps (IE just basic search for end point by category). There's no reason for this to be the case since *clearly the app already has that feature*, they just didn't accommodate for any of that in the AA UI. So since basically all of my waze user experience is via Android Auto on my panisonic radio (or in my Pacifica with its 10.1 screen) I have to down rate waze considerably. Insane choices were made, as far as I can tell to focus on a minimalistic UI. Ironically I think minimalistic is a good thing, but only to a point."
"Too much clutter, the team seems to need to show that they are working and the only way they found is adding more and more stuff on the screen. And when you make abstraction of the visual clutter you realize that the app is no more accurate. Last and most important thing is that the app is becoming DANGEROUS. I spend more and more time on screen closing banners, where my eyes should be on the road. So, this is really not the good way to go."
"I love Waze - always have. But for the past few months, 9 times out of 10 it can't find me via GPS for any longer than a few seconds when all of the sudden it will beep and tell me I am somewhere completely different. It will do this about 20 more times, beep and change location, then find my exact location. Stay on me for about 1 minute, then lose me again. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, I have checked everything on my phone to make sure it isn't that, I have even called my phone company thinking my phone was defective. Low and behold my GPS works with every other app. When Waze works I love it! WHEN it works isn't very often unfortunately."
"My go-to for driving. It's accurate like 99% of the time. However, there have been a few instances where Waze has failed to recognize road closures. I like that you can add caution warnings for other drivers for things like objects in the road, hidden police, crashes and others. Quite handy."
Absolutely brilliant wish I had it when i was an hgv driver (now retired)üëç
"I have to also be running google maps running at the same time for my location to update correctly. I have all data/ battery saver options turned off for this app. Also, for long trips I frequently get ""no routes found"" after a long wait. I used to love waze and would tell anyone who would listen about it."
"Isn't working properly, won't load when I am trying to find out traffic and times to get to places at different times despite the fact I have full wifi and no issues with google maps so it isnt my phone... Gets worse with every update!!! When it works its great but so unreliable and faulty, especially when using it for work!"
This app is very easy to use. Helps me get around accidents and heavy traffic. I have recommended this app to everyone I know.
Updates made the app worse. Frequently fails to connect. Unable to start drive at times
"Waze is precise, fast and pretty easy to use. Although there are minor parts to be refined: When choosing between routes, the map tab should be shown by default. Also when adding stops to the route, the app should ask whether it's before the initial destination or after it."
This app literally will not work. I've installed and uninstalled then reinstalled it several times and it will not connect to the network. No maps. No addresses. No nothing. Maybe there is an update I need? I remember ditching this a couple years ago for connectivity issues and apparently they haven't been solved
"As navagation display road number and exit number very small to see as driving, including m25 , A13, A12 need addressing this issue. Also cannot avoid couty lane Options."
"Fantastic navigation app, the best I've used so far, would easily be 5 stars but for one minor point. When using the app to plan routes, it only gives options for motorised vehicles on roads, there no option for walking or cycling a particular journey. So that was Nov 2019! Not wanting to seem pushy, but is there any chance of a reply?"
"Waze has always be my number one when it comes to navigation not until my recent horrible experience that you will be on the right way and the app would ask turn to the other way and still come back to the same route. The horrible part of it is that the app sometimes lost location and you wouldn't know where to go. I don't know where or what you have done wrong on the application, it's just out of the way."
Best navigation.. EVER!! Notifies ahead of time that there's a cop ahead or vehicle along side the road or object in the road though it does not tell you which side of the road a vehicle is stopped on but the heads up so you are aware is awesome!! Definitely my go to app for navigation!! No hesitation to get in the vehicle and just go.. I know waze will make sure I arrive at any destination I choose!! Amazing job developers!! Thank you!! üòä
"Fantastic, its basically a verry accurate Maps app that has all of the capabilities of google maps or apple maps, but also allows you to find out where all of the speed cameras, police, roadworks and even pot holes for those low guys out there. Hugely recommend this app why would you not use it, never worry about a speeding ticket again, you wont get one!"
"Love this, use it everyday even when I don't have any desired destination for some of the awesome features. It's pretty much a social networking GPS, driver's can update map in real time letting you know where police and hazards are on the road. Sure it has bugs but nothing that would keep me from using it."
"It is a good app. But unfortunately, when it comes to travel around the world, I need an offline mode, such as to download the map & offline navigation mode in order to use it when I am traveling. Please make an update that had an offline mode and the ability to download the map. If you do it, then I will give it a 5 star. Thank you."
Thank you. I've uploaded the debug logs. Hopefully gets sorted soon Edit: since my earlier review things have changed. A couple of updates ago Waze hasn't been able to connect to traffic conditions or show anything. I've gone back to using Google maps just so I can get to and from my destinations while avoiding traffic. I really hope this gets fixed because Waze was my go to GPS
"The best üëå I use it traveling every where alert when there traffic, police, accidents and car stop also reroute real time route for short travel only problems is when it time to update it goes Lil off"
"I love the app, but it does drive me mad at times. Every time I stop, the search bar appears and will stay there covering the speed and speed limit up. The search bar should ONLY be visible when starting the app or tapping to view saved places. This is quite annoying."
"This used to be a great app, but its changed for the worse lately. Between the app thinking I am driving on different roads to the insistence of re-routing me back to it's original route (instead of calculating a new fastest route), I find myself shutting it down and not bothering to use it any more."
"It will make you go out of your way and add 2-3 miles to your route that is 10 minutes if it thinks it saves you 10 seconds. Also be ready to zigzag thru town with waze and/or take rough terrain, back roads, you name it! Lastly the box for directions and informations on Android auto takes half the screen. Whoever is in charge of their UX/UI need to teleport to 21st century."
"Worst $#!+ app on the market! Moved to new city, it sent me the complete opposite way, literally! Freeway I needed was right down the street. You sent me miles in the wrong direction to a different freeway, just to get to the one I needed. F#@K YOU! F#@K YOU! F#@K YOU!"
"""No network connection"" yet I'm able to redownload the app and watch videos on YouTube and use all my other apps, very inconvenient if this happens while your on a journey. still buggy. It's like you guys want us to stop using the app very disappointing and yes I've restarted my phone a few times and uninstall and downloaded the app a good multiple of times."
"The program is OK, but if it had traffic sign recognition it would be great. In most cases it does not tell me the option of which is the shortest way to go in the destination. It has often introduced me to HW, when there are plenty of other options. In Google Map you can see some options to go in the destination. When you are in HW 400 you know to show in advance the lane arrows you have to follow and not at the last moment"
"The icons that appear during the route are way too small. Need a setting to change sizes. Each of the alerts would be better if you could customise the audio alert for each one. Plus offline map download would be very useful, especially in the west country where the data signal was poor to nothing."
Loved the app and used it for years. Within the past month tho now I no longer can rely on its navigation to get me anywhere I wasn't already familiar with on directions! The app now will get me lost if I take an unfamiliar route and/or destination. Get it together. Why ruin a great app?!
"I am not impressed. This app keep favoring left turns, and in Canada, that's a huge waste of time. It also keeps rerouting even when I specifically chose another route and that's very frustrating. I stopped using it mainly because of this. Also because I think its dangerous: ads that pop up when driving (using my data, thanks...), It also keeps asking if the police or else is still there: I am driving bro, I should be focusing on the road, not your app. My advice: don't use this app"
"Used to love it, but now it's always searching for gps location, and just generally refusing to work especially when outside my home state."
Great design but somewhat inefficient navigation. Seems like the app is unable to differentiate between heavy traffic jams and minor stop-and-goes. Today it redirected me several times avoiding the highways which cost me 1 hour of time and many nerve cells because of driving some tiny suspicious roads and serpentines that could have been avoided. It's OK to be used purely for speed limits notifications when travelling abroad but not as a primary means of navigation. Use Google maps instead.
Top Gps easiest to using and largests the grab car driver e-hailing use it on by this gps Apps....5 stars
I used it really enjoying using this app. But since googles got their little fingers into this app there's nothing more than constant bug fixes and instabilizations you guys remind me of me of Microsoft if you took the time and went through something to do it right you wouldn't be annoying us with all these updates and I'm gonna call it useless updates because you don't fix the problem you create more problem. Hopefully someone from BlackBerry decides to make phones in their operating system
Since the last update (28th July) the app is acting very sloppy on AndroidAuto (it often freeze).
"Waze interface degrades from update to update. Jumpy menues and search, no control over notifications as in previous versions and very messy navigation inside the app when starting up. No consistency in basic features as planning a trip for later. Keep it basic. The current user experience is far below the older ones."
"needs improvement in some parts. example is, some ways that are supposed to be in straight route, waze is giving longer routes."
"the worst app. it is always wrong on arrival time by over 30 minutes. I hate this app, it just gets worse every single time in use it. not only is it wrong with time by 45 mins but it will tell you to zigzag to your destination which ends up adding double the total time. This app is a waste of time, if you like being late or wasting time, this is the app for you."
"As an old user i believe this app has some fundamental weaks: 1) It doesn't show all of streets and allies name at the same time on user's path during navigation on map. In case cellphone cannot receive the gps signals it can be useful to find your path by using around streets' and allies' name on the map as clue and guide. 2) For navigating a location from other apps, when you click on destination to launch the Waze , it only runs and doesn't begin the navigating process and the most of times you should try it several times so that it starts the navigation process by chance. 3) The most of times before beginning the navigating process, the Waze shows to the user the ""send location"" balloon that it causes to interrupt the navigating process as a bothersome. 4) In term of distance-time to find an appropriate path, sometimes it cannot do it well"
I was using Waze before other people even knew what it was because I'm the one who put them onto it because I thought Google maps sucked. Well things change because I have had so many issues with the Waze app for the past month. I've had it freeze on me bring me to the wrong location in the midst of driving just suddenly changed directions and then change them back sorry but I'm all done with ways back to Google maps
Now it has a gps failure with Android auto. The signal is received but not accurate at all most the time it has me backwards. No speed indicator. Lags and jumps instead of a smooth scroll . Fresh upload and cleared cache/memory of both Android Auto and waze will function properly for one route next attempt to use problem returns with GPS issue. Wifi and Bluetooth advanced accuracy off and full waze gps promission. Nothing helps trying to force it to reestablish gps locations doesn't help either.
"I'd like to be able to use waze, it has some great features. It doesn't connect to GPS reliably, often can't route or drops the route. Waze has similar issues whether running on my phone or tablet. Niether device have issues running Google Maps, so I doubt the devices are the problem."
"I'm not sure what happened whether the update on Skip side or Waze side broke the application. When I tap on the destination in Skip, it redirects to Waze then it gives me directions to where I want to go but now, I have to type in the address manually every time. If the devs see this review, please look into it and find the root cause then fix it. Thank you."
"Just installed it. Please add integration with Musicolet. All the privacy invading options should be disabled by default not enabled by default. After I actually use it driving somewhere I will come back and update my rating. I wouldn't even have installed it if they were retiring Android auto which already worked perfectly which is probably why they're getting rid of it. You know Google, if it works get rid of it and make a new version that doesn't."
"I love this app! I can tell me what time i need to leave inorder to reach my destination for the time that i specify. It rakes into account current traffic conditions and sends me alerts for leaving a bit earlier or later so that i reach my destination when i want to. It gives me heads up for objects in the roadway or construction. It rarely, if ever sends me to the wrong location. I recommend it to everyone, especially highway/interstate commuters!"
The updates have ruined a once brilliant app. I have deleted it and reinstalled it and now I cannot log in. It's says it has lost my account details. This is extremely disappointing. The app cannot get a GPS location again. I deleted it and re installed and the problem is back. The updates have once again made the app worse.
"Would be higher if the app didn't constantly close. I drove 10 minutes past my exit today before I realized the app closed and was no longer giving directions. A map app shouldn't be able to close without a notification or alert. It's insane that a directions app should be able to close with no notifications. While driving 70mph down the freeway, I shouldn't have to keep checking to make sure my directions app is still working. I'm going to have to uninstall, this is unacceptable."
"This used to be a great app. However, recently when I enter any destination details, it gives me wrong directions. I mean even the small arrow on the map doesn't face straight. If I'm driving on a straight road, the arrow faces towards a different direction, which makes it difficult to follow."
"I like this app for helping me find locations and for the speed limit info while driving there. My only complaint is while navigating to an address, it has pop-ups suggesting places to eat or visit on the way. This covers up the map and is distracting (and annoying) while driving."
I absolutely love using Waze!I really like how it is the social media of navigating around your local areas and or anywhere you might be traveling but what I do not like is how sometimes it does not give you various routes based on traffic or based on distance and another thing that I really don't like is it takes forever and tells you when to turn at the very last second.... Other than those things I think the app is fantastic bucking use a little bit of improvement.......
"On the motorola G6 play (brand new phone), OS version Android 9. waze is connecting to GPS way to much when I'm trying to go on a route and because of that it shows an approximate location. I have to mention that the phone had a factory data reset, app have all the permissions and the location is activated. also the device had no physical damage. With google maps I have no issue and is bothering me because I used this app for a few years and you make it whorse."
"I got a new phone today and I noticed I don't have any Voices selection Is this one of the bugs you're working out? Oh! And I almost got into an accident the other day as I was on the freeway exit ramp. An ad popped up and obscured my screen as I tried to see which way I'd have to turn. Not a good look, Waze."
"UPDATE: The app was fixed in one of the last few updates... Working like it used to. This app used to be rock solid then a Google update or waze update ruined it a few months ago. I've deleted waze and AA and reinstalled and it still won't show speed limit, like it used to, and the map spins and jumps around. I've tried taking a trip via navigation, still no speed limit. I should give it 1 star. And to top it off, I'm running them on a Pixel 4. Google owns the apps and made the phone..."
Waze is crashing all the time on samsung galaxy 20s
"Ever since I installed this app several months ago, I have had nothing but dissappointment. Instead of taking you through the simplest routes, it takes you through a hundred shortcuts that delay you a half hour more. HAPPENS EVERY TIME. Officially done with Waze. It's a shame, because I like that it's user-friendly and it has a simple design, but I just can't trust it."
Used to love this app. But the last couppe of months it keeps crashing and freezing mid journey on my Pixel 2XL. It's caused me to miss turns and arrive late so many times now. It also always seems to tell me to take roads throigh the country instead of motorways which are clearly quicker. My settings are all tripple checked and I havent set it to avoid motorways or anything like that. I only use waze over google because of the speed cameras and speedometer... but now it's good bye! üëã
"I use to love Waze and use it every day to get to work, despite knowing HOW to get there on my own. Since the latest update, Waze does not work with Android Auto. It consistently tells me there is no network, tries to calculate the route for several minutes, or completely crashes. I was looking forward to using Waze for an over 3,000 mile solo road trip I am currently on. Unfortunately, I had to switch to a different GPS application that works with Android Auto."
I never thought this map navigation is amazing.
So much better than before! Still directs me in literally the wrong direction 2 out of 10 times. Sending me to the exact opposite end of town from the address I cut and pasted in. But it did save me from 3 tickets while driving thru California so I feel 4 stars is appropriate. I have no idea why it randomly sends me in literally the opposite direction from the address I enter every once and a while but all and all not junk.
I have been Waze user for many year and was one of my favourite app. Recently it has become real pain. The signs to get off motorway are not very easy to read as I rather have text telling me which junction to get off rather than imitation signs which are soo small and not easy to read. The application keeps crashing now while in use and have to relaunch it again. Then there are network not found issues which only happens with this app as rest of the apps are all working fine. too many Bugs now!
Something is wrong with Waze. It doesn't seem to want to connect. Waze team pls fix this bug.
Not bad. When I tried to navigate to work it kept telling me to circle the block at come back the opposite direction so I would turn left on to the street in front of my work instead of turning right. Also when reporting police you have to be standing next to then in order to report it. It's illegal to hold my phone while in a running vehicle making reporting accurate police locations impossible . It should be possible to select a location and direction of travel remotely when reporting.
"This used to be my favorite app. But as of the last few months, it's been pretty much just absolute garbage. From the app searching for routes but going back to default and saying ""the server timed out"", to the app also just flat out crashing in the middle of navigation. It's basically useless to me now."
"Lately the app has been taking strange routes. Through neighborhoods, down alleys, and lots of unnecessary turns. It evens refuses to change to the direct route in the list. It suggested a route going down something I don't think qualified as a street. If you are trying to get users to stop using the app it's working."
Map won't move when I'm driving just freezes u need to test updates b4 releasing them make sure it works with android auto as people use this for there daily lives
"Deems to glitch a lot but unsure if it is Waze or the app that I use it thru, Postmates. Sometimes takes a person to a location just off of the actual address especially if the address is located in an area where the street is intersected with an area that cannot be driven thru but this could be due to the crazy streets and anomalies of the greater Seattle area."
I have tried all online suggestions on how to remove my waze and carpool tab shown on bottom of map but nothing works. It is taking up space on the bottom making my map to small to use! We need the full screen. Especially in landscape mode. Just put a button in options to add my waze/carpool tab on bottom of screen if anyone wants it. For those of us who don't want it we would be grateful. I received a message back for request. Was told this is how we want the app to look and live with it. Wow!
"I really don't know what's going on with Waze lately the past month it is been loading Maps extremely slow, it's was not letting me report for the entire month if there was an accident a stranded vehicle or police on the road nothing at all! And now when I load directions it just takes forever and I have to open Google Maps to get where I need to go! And tonight it sent me to the wrong location and said I have reached my destination and I put in the correct address and it sent me two blocks away"
"Appears to take the long way around! Also I cannot stand it's constant alerts that there's a stopped car ahead! First I heard I almost freaked out as I was moving quite fast on interstate. I absolutely feel these alerts must change their wording or go because they can cause their own accidents, my stopped, crashed car on the road to be specific! Be careful with this type alert, keep in mind users are DRIVING and false alarms are not acceptable!!"
"It's a good app, I like the fact that road users can share hazards etc immediately. There's been an update through Android auto side of things which is a bit of a pain, it puts the info screen in the way and squashes the map. Why can't we move the info screen accross or resize it? A bit of customisation here wouldn't go a miss."
"The app has gotten better over the years, but it still freaks out when I pull off the road to make a pit-stop. The app should have a pop-up asking if you need to stop for food or fuel instead of constantly trying to reroute when you pull off the route after a few hours of driving. The search for gas price option is kind of useless while driving. When I do a road trip I just want the closest gas station, and I can't deal with scrolling through a list of gas prices while driving, so I gave up using that option after the first time as it is unsafe."
"Fine once you turn the voice directions off, otherwise you will literally hear directions every 20 seconds for the duration of your journey."
"Won't flip the screen when the phone is upside down. The only way that my phone will stay in the mount is upside down, due to the charging cables. I tried disabling auto zoom and standing disabling ""prevent auto lock"" but it made no difference. Guess I'm going back to Google Maps."
Great app for up to date and time road information
"I downloaded waze as an alternative to google maps, however this navigation system is terrible. No walking or public transit option. It drains my battery faster than any other app. So if if you dont have a charger good luck because its going to kill your battery in no time. Also, it sends me on wild goose chases all the time while.im driving for work, sending me to the wrong locations all the time. And it also crashes atleast once a day while trying to use it. Redownloading google maps now!"
"I've been using this app for years, planned drives & all, even for interstate traveling without issues. Lately the planned route feature will not load with traffic or at all. 2 months ago, it worked. Now it doesn't. Fix the issue & it'll go back to a 5 star rating. Issue is valid on S6, Note 5, Note 8, Tab E & Tab S4"
"Worked OK for some time, now it's back to the blank maps, stuttering display when it does sort of work .... On Ford Sync 3 fully updated and Android 9 ... And it still refuses to work properly ... Even when android auto and Google maps do !!!! .... Had enough of this and will not be using again as I need something which is reliable !!!!"
Always bring user to the most jam way and pass Alot of toll but not even faster to reach the destination.
Update: Recently Waze is not starting navigation because it can't find a starting point. Another recent issue is showing unable to connect even when I am doing a speed test. Waze told me that after I made three reports that my report privilege might be suspended. I reported two traffic slowdowns at the beginning of a slowdown and then a vehicle hazard on the side of the road when I received this rude message. It seems Google is against us reporting.
"A brilliant SatNav app, that keeps you updated with traffic and incidents based on other users and reporting! Quicker and more up to date than my local radio! My only bit of bad feedback is the adverts - I get that the app needs to earn money, but can you not have the Ads come up in the middle of the journey, cover the whole app and prevent the voice navigation to work? It's illegal to touch your phone while driving to shut the ad, it means the app is useless till you can pull over and close it"
"I like the app and use it to avoid traffic jams. To navigate to addresses seems to be less accurate than before, so I don't 100% trust it's capability. On several occasions, it's taken me to the wrong location, I'm not talking by a lot, but 2 or 3 streets away."
"There are no longer easily accessible settings in this application and it is really hard to get the app to point in the direction the vehicle is traveling. Additionally, am I logged into the application or not, I can't find those setting anywhere. In attempt to make this application direct they have increased the difficulty to use it and customize to fit the user. I am also on my second waze account because they lost my login info and stopped allowing me to sign in. What happened to waze?"
"App looks marginally useful, but I need something I can set once and let it automate and that I can verify that it's set. After scouring every setting/help menu, I see no way to set planned time to leave reminders to repeat. Nor do I see a way to plan a trip out more than 7 days. Maybe something in Waze's interaction with Calendars intends to substitute for viewing such notifications within the Waze app. In any case, it's not ""easy"" to find, & I already wasted enough time here. Uninstall."
"I would have to agree with David on this one. I have had numerous problems with this app, sometimes it will freeze while I'm on my way to a certain location and will re route me completely. Those ads are annoying and asking if there is still a wreck or police may cause a wreck or have me pulled over by the police! Lol."
"the updated music interface is horrible. it now requires additional screen touches to open, change song, and requires to be minimized to see the map at normal color. it is much safer and convenient to have the music interface always displayed while viewing the driving map in it's normal configuration"
"Worst navigation I have seen. It drives me to go around without any reason. I drive straight e.g. In road A, it directs me to go out of A into B and then re-enter A. That way is more difficult, more distance, slower etc. I kept going straight in B which was easier etc. Speed limits are wrong, it doesn't notify every time i exceed the limit and so on. Stupid app. I uninstall it."
"As a user for 5+ years, I've got to concur with the most recent reviews. How to grab defeat from the jaws of victory. From trying to write this review, to being constantly logged out from app upgrades, to username not recognised in the mobile app, to not able to login via the web portal, to trying to verify my credentials after an app upgrade and getting a 'Connecting' message that never completes, to not recognising my email address on password reset or fails due to a very poor Android Auto integration that insists on running as if I am a new user. Time to dust of the actual requirements; reliability, ease of use and works every time!"
"Still can't show new info in regards to this pandemic for even something as simple as store hours. Something that really sets Google Maps apart in these circumstances. Also, other suggestions to really become the go-to maps application is to have destination suggestions based on searches and such. That's something that's really handy in GMaps. Don't hide locations that are closed, instead show them, but have those up to date current info about it being closed due to the pandemic, like GMaps."
"Does not work with android auto. I plug into my radio, turn on waze, set a destination, and the icon just sits there and never moves. It does not record my trip. Also trying to submit a report is frustrating. It keeps telling me my email is invalid. I have already deleted waze and android auto and reinstalled them. Did not fix it."
"Hi, please update malaysia all toll fees,currently is half price amount,thanks"
"Would be nice to see lane information, just like Google Maps, especially now that Google owns Waze. For example, which lane to stay on during GPS navigation. Also, alternate routes seem to have gotten worse lately. The alternate routes it suggests end up making me later in the long run."
Cannot log into my account. Terrible UX and experience. Just as bad as Google Maps. Constantly sends me through dangerous intersections instead of sending me the way that I want to go no matter how many times I told it that I don't want to take certain routes. What are more it constantly sends me the most ridiculous ways instead of the direct way. Jesus Christ MapQuest was better!
Most of the time pretty decent and like being able to use Spotify also. However do not like it finding better routes for me while I'm in the middle of trying to follow the one I'm already on without me asking. I wish there was a way from the beginning to avoid roads with tolls. If there is I haven't figured it out
"I've used waze in the past with no issues. When I tried to get into it today, it claimed it couldn't verify my email address, said it was verified in an email! But the code I wax to put in was not in the email. I sign in everything with Google saved settings so not sure what happened. I have Uninstaller waze and now stuck using Google maps, which I was trying to avoid. I wish sites would leave things alone when they work, and not keep trying to make ""improvements "" with their ""updates ""."
It works right most of the time but I do find myself having Google Maps open at the same time just because I feel like they go back and forth on which one gives the best and quickest directions I do love the reporting of traffic and hazards etc especially compared to Google Maps at least where it's at right now with that feature definitely don't see myself getting rid of ways anytime soon.
"I loved the easy the app worked especially giving an approximate planned arrival time. All of a sudden, it would stop working. I would uninstall and then install. It would work for a little bit and then again, it would not open. sounds like Google maps is next in line."
"The accident and traffic recognition needs a serious revamp. I was driving home on a long journey and it updated my navigation saying there was an accident up ahead but it was over an hour away. We finally get to where the accident was and there was multiple reports that showed traffic, cops and an accident but yet we cruised thru like nothing was there. This has been an issue I've noticed in the past before from Waze. Please work on getting this more accurate."
"Both me and my parents have had trouble since the new update, as a new driver it's really frustrating when we are on the way to somewhere and an ad pops up in the middle of a direction being given. My dad had used this app in the past but he has since given up with it because of the trouble he has had between ads and incorrect directions."
"Great Google Maps kind of driving app thats definitely worth activating if you haven't already and giving it a try. Its got a live map layout, shows many traffic issues which a symbol is placed exactly where its been reported, if its a moderate or heavy problem for; traffic jams+ accidents, stopped cars, speed & red light cameras (intersections, fixed & mobile 1offs), booze buses, stopped police vehicles, road closures, etc. Has great info/sounds when driving to, is clearer than Google for me."
"Great app. The crowd sourced traffic data is great. The app can also find the nearest petrol station which is a life saver. *Update March 2020*. The ""submit fuel prices"" feature works fine now. Changing my review to 5 stars. The only draw back is the ""submit nearby fuel prices "" feature , which rarely works. It normally claims it can not find a GPS signal, even though other location based parts of the app are functioning fine."
"I tried to use this on a whim while travelling. I admit I did not study on how the features, but most things are intuitive. It was PARTICULARLT HARD for me to interpret the ICONS used for roadwork, slow traffic, etc. I did figure out ""constructios, police presence, etc, but the icons were too cutesy and stylized and hard to read in a moving vehicle even form the advantage of ""shotgun"" seat."
Not showing any roads other than India highways. Bad
"I really like this app a lot! It loads about 10 TIMES faster than google navigation for maps go, it has WAY more options than Google navigation for maps/maps go, it's a lot more fun than google navi for maps go. .... So.... It's a lot better than google navigation for maps/maps go. I would've given it 5 stars, except for the fact that it loses the GPS signal WAY too often and, when it does while you're driving, your car icon will wind up 2 or 3 streets over it'll start going psycho."
"Oh Waze, what happened? This app used to be reliable and accurate! Sometimes, I would be later than my estimated arrival time but that is fine however, the last few months, my commute has been extended at least 20+ minutes! I understand where I live has high traffic areas but Waze used to notify me once traffic is building up ahead, not anymore! Now, once I turn into a road with traffic or construction, Waze will increase my commute tremendously and there is nothing I can do about it. It tells you that you will be stuck in traffic ONCE you are IN the traffic areas. If I hadn't made that turn, I could have avoided those roads. Why bother choosing which route is best when it would actually be the longest to take? Please fix this, this app used to be the very best."
"I love it more than google maps! Waze is more than a GPS! The features I use the most are speed tracking and hazard alerts. You can't beat the real time updates. The most helpful tool in Waze is the planned trips, that lets you look at a locations busiest times and find the best time to leave. Waze will reroute you in some weird back ways but it saves time so much time."
"I appreciate it when Waze offers sound alternative routes when construction activity blocks main freeways. Unfortunately, Waze doesn't always get it right. This app directed into road closures without warning twice. One time the detour route it offered was closed and it didn't offer a second alternative, is frustrating especially at night."
Why does after the recent updates..Gps is always difficult to detect? Always took very long to show the navigation route. After many times force close the app..then only will the navigation route line appear. Works so fine in the past..just open the app..enter the address..navigation route appears..then off u go. Now..so frustrating. Is it bug or something? Pls do something to make it as effective and effecient as before.
"I tried to sign in with my phone number. The only thing app said it found me but an error pops up saying unable to verify account. Facebook sign in also has a similar issue. UPDATE: It did not give an option to change the password only to create a new account. I clicked back on the verify error message, the app froze for a second and then signed into my account. So at least I have access once more."
"Update: as you can see the developer replied with INCORRECT info. The link they gave me are directions for the error message ""no gps"". Not the actual problem I had. Changed review!! several times when I lived in Seattle and now SA Texas. I have gotten lost because the GPS is not correct or the location is not correct when it comes to Waze putting me in the right direction. they need to update or fix whatever needs to happen because I should be able to put in an address and not get lost."
It was a great app on my old phone (a Galaxy S8) through Android Auto but having just upgraded to a Galaxy S10 the location is completely flaky. It is constantly resetting the map to where I was 5 minutes ago or to a street I was never even on. It is not the location service on my phone as Google Maps has no issues knowing where I am during my drive. Please sort this out as I much prefer Waze (when working) to Google Maps.
"This is a first class navigation app I use it every day it's brilliant for getting round traffic download it now it's owned by Google Maps and it's better than Google Maps! however it is not perfect I have never been able to log into my account on a new phone because it never recognises my login details, also some of us wazers drive wider vehicles so it would be brilliant if we could have more choice of vehicles because of width restrictions on some roads they are a pain."
Pop up point of interest ads are not acceptable while driving. They cover a large portion of the screen and can be distracting or dangerous. They should only be allowed at a full stop... I'm reading others that say it only happens while they are not in motion but I get them while IN motion. I'll give waze 5 stars if this is fixed. Please fix it.
It used to be the best navigation app but since last year barely tells Me if there's a speed camera on the road quite often takes Me down from the main road through what it feels like someone elses kitchen and back garden just to save no time what so ever. Even tho route suggestions switched off it still changes the route on long journeys to whatever it feels like. Huge disappointment.
"While navigating the current journey the app simultaneously seems to be trying to complete a previous one. This is very confusing and makes the app practically unusable. It was my preferred nav app until this started happening. Edit - since the latest updates it seems to have improved, but I'll need to test it quite a lot before I trust it again with important journeys."
"Why Waze cant go fullscreen mode without showing a black bar on the left side in lanscape orientation,please fix it :("
This was a five-star app for me up until this recent update within the last month. I use Waze with Android auto and it worked fine before. When I plug in my phone the display on infotainment screen no longer has the arrow face North continuously. if I'm going south the arrow is south and the roads and mapping are not as easy to follow. I hope this issue will be fixed soon. I had to switch back to Google maps today to get home because I was so annoyed. Google Maps still has arrow facing North
"I've had this as my main navigation system for about a year. At first it was pretty good, but now an ad or reminder about Waze pool will pop up right while I'm driving. I tried to stay with it, but it's just way too dangerous and irritating!!!"
This app really sucks. It doesn't work at all. Black screen freezes and don't navigate. Since update. This app need to be updated. Google maps shows option to avoid highways on android auto. Waze too much hassle. When driving can't be fiddling with take cord off charger on android auto to look for avoid highways in settings. Not safe Waze update the app for safety to choose on interface with android auto.
"Waze is amazing and so smart. It not only uses original maps, but uses it's users to update and make changes to the map. If you report something like a animal hazard than it will show straight away on the map to all users, except those that aren't online wile driving. Thank you so much, waze is truly special!!!"
"Best app, specially with speed cameras, it gives you a real time update with traffic with a 5-10 min margin error sometimes,the GPS location plays up specially when near motorway there are small side roads but it calibrates instantly, I have not found a better app, no Google maps,tomtom nothing and its free. Only think would be nice if once you finish your journey you can add it as favourite for example if you have an account so every morning based on your commuting can give you real time updates or traffic support. Also the meniu for the most used road obstacles or police would be nice to e added instead of going through all the list while driving, it takes to much time but 10/10 10* iy is the best for todays apps.many thanks"
"Would be great if the keyboard wouldn't close in the middle of searching the destination...every time..and when choosing a destination you have press the location then press go then press go now. One ""go"" is enough. Please remove the ""go now"". If I didn't want to go now I wouldn't have pressed go to begin with. Otherwise a very helpful app."
"This app is absolutely AWFUL! I use it to get to and from work not because I don't know how to get to and from work but because there is traffic, construction, and road closures that I would prefer to avoid as much as possible. This app does a wonderful job of taking you the route that takes the longest. It will find you the worst possible route and your trip will end up taking considerably longer because you will undoubtedly be stuck in stand still traffic."
"How does this get better reviews than google maps? I searched for restaurants, and it showed me a mere 10 within 1.2 miles of me, but it gave me no other options, even when moving within the map. Also, the slow-start-slow-finish zoom is awful. This is like using MapQuest from 1998."
"Used to work perfectly but since Google has gotten its hands on this app it's been all down hill! Thanks a lot!! For the past 2 weeks everytime I try to use this app it's either showing as connection issues, which is bull as all other app work fine, just tries to load or crashes. I tried to delete and reinstall it over 20 times and the issues has only gotten worse. This is all on top of all the bogus routes, redirection and general nonsense that it's been up to up until these major issues"
I was a bit skeptical about an open source Google maps. But its reliable and I use it more than my Sat Nav due to it intuitive features. One problem is that I think there is a bug that prevents the button to enable/disable the invisibility mode from showing up. Which means I am permanently stuck on invisible which is why I left 4 stars out of 5.
"It's mostly great, with one glaring flaw: route numbers. I don't know how road naming works in the rest of the world, but in New England, most of our ""numbered routes"" also have ""local names"" which can vary by town or county despite the route number staying constant. Often, only the numbers and not the local names appear on signs. But except for major divided highways, Waze refuses to use anything but the local names. This is a SERIOUS problem for navigation!"
"the app used to be wonderful. but for over a month now it takes me at least 10+ tries for me to get Waze to calculate a route. it says ""uh-oh! error calculating route!"" seriously shouldn't have to route myself a billion times in a row before it finally calculates it. been using Waze for years and never had this issue till over a month ago. and yes I have great server when routing. please fix this before I go back to Google maps...."
"Basically the same old juvenile, cumbersome app it was the last time I gave it a go nearly five years ago but with one bonus feature; if your route starts near a road closure it will magically start your route on the other side of the closure. Crisis averted. Just pick your car up and plop it on the other side. Why didn't I think of that?"
I would be able to use this app more if it showed detailed maps like Google Maps does. I need to see all of the streets around me when I'm driving to know where I'm going. Also Google search does not work when I'm using Waze which really sucks! And now the app has all kinds of little icons all over the road which is very distracting. I have not been able to figure out exactly what they're for but it looks like they are other Wazers. For what reason who knows??
My favorite GPS app for live driving updates. Only thing I wish was different is that it would be nice if the voice volume control was easier to access directly from the bottom or top left menu. As it is it takes several buttons to get to it and while driving that's not safe.
I have been using waze for months travelling from Liverpool to Manchester and back for my normal commute and IV contributed a lot so I'm thinking this is great compared to Google maps. Wrong! I ended up heading to manc 3 days on the run where waze took me on the M62 where for 3 days it was closed on the main junction. I got stuck behind traffic for nearly a hour. I switched to Google maps who took me around on the 4th day. Deleted and sticking with Google maps. They need to integrate Google
"Since I upgraded my Pixel 2 XL to Android 11, when running Waze, the map display on my car's screen (Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross, SW version U) freezes and the location is updated only every 10-30 seconds. It seems that the GPS is freezing or loosing connection all the time. BTW, everything worked fine in Android 10. Using latest Android Auto 5.6.603444"
"I tried this app years ago, but encountered the battery drain issue. Never tried it again. After hearing great reviews from many I figured it was time for another go. Within 15 mins of app use, nope. 3 different speed limits, not once did the app show me the correct speed. I don't think it's any better with battery drain. Brand new Note 10 +. Up until now I go from 100% to 68% from 6am - 12am, heavy use. Today, 6am - 6:46pm, I'm at 28%. No good! That's enough for me. Back to Google maps."
"This waze app is garbage. I used this app a few years ago - it was very good, trying to avoid those pesky cops milking law abiding drivers. Now, it's garbage. I installed it to know what's up with people leaving bad comments. It is true, the application is garbage. You need to make sure to turn on the GPS even I had my wifi is on. So I turned my GPS and wifi on, and typing the destination will just show you the area, but it wouldn't give you a route, not a single route. This waze is trash!!"
im not sure what the hell is going on but after the update I can no longer use this app. tried uninstalling and reinstalling it but it still doesnt work. it keeps telling me it cant connect to a network but I tried google maps and it works perfectly fine. ill rate this one star unless you guys can give me a solution on how to operate this again. something is wrong with your app
I use this app for confirmation purposes. Very often made me confused due to sudden error from the app. Please improve on this!!!
Waze used to be the gold standard. Now it is unusable. Turn by turn directions are useless. When I pull up to an intersection the map is at least 30 seconds or more behind. The lag makes it unusable. It's not my phone. Google maps works just fine.
I have been using this app for 4 years now. Up until this past year it was a great cop that gave you the alternative routes that were faster and saved you time. For the past Ford five months this app has been a big disappointment. It no longer gives you quicker alternate routes but instead gives you the regular route which is in traffic. No more shortcuts as options. I've been using Google Maps as a better alternative.
"Was great...The app was working great for over a year. Today on my 11 hour trip from Minneapolis to Detroit it completely crashed on me. The routing server went offline for me and I was forced to use Google maps, which added an hour and 20 minutes to my trip. This is a huge let down."
"Outside of Central London this is a great sat nav software. It aggressively searches for quicker routes, far better at that than Google maps. HOWEVER Waze does not avoid the congestion charge zone. This is terribly dosappointing and has lead me to receive three penalty charges which i would love to be compensated for but i doubt Waze will acknowledge this message. I now use Google maps because I have to be able to trust the app I use to assist me with my navigation through the tight roads of LDN"
Add an Add speeding camera function! And add an add a train option! pls!
"I like the simple and straight forward design. I think reporting could be a lot more useful or customizable. For instance, I usually tend to report more cops or hazards. So those should be on the map screen. Maybe like last 3 used. One button reporting will make it a lot faster and safer."
"Android auto issue : After the last update. When I get call Waze is not able to keep up with my location. My icon change from car to dot and it stays on the map where I received the call, untill the end of the call and map don't move at all Fix this and I'll give 5* I really love this app. Also the railroad crossing is annoying. Have options to disable that notification. Thanks Finally the Oct-2020 update solve the issue I had during calls. It's working fine now"
This app always chooses the worst possible route and will never suggest a better one. It is so annoying.
"My experience with Waze is awful. Definitely the worst GPS app I have ever used. Whenever I have used it, it would take me the long route, instead of the shortest. Or even sometimes, the incorrect route. If you are using this app because of community based reporting, I would recommend Google maps instead. Google maps let's you do the exact thing, with a far better GPS system, with the quickest route, including best accuracy."
"I think Waze is great with the exception of ""my places"" it would be nice if the places could be alphabetized. The most recent places i use and the frequent ones should at least stay at the top but they just get mixed in. So aggravating. Also it would be nice to add more then 2 addresses to a route. I walk several dogs and it would be nice to add at least 4-5 address. Other then that it gets me to where i have to go."
"Loved Waze when i first started using it, but it crashes a lot and can't find network. have been in Southern Missouri and the app is very inaccurate when it isn't crashing. Off by miles in some cases. I had issues with it not finding the network in Tennessee, Ohio, and Missouri. couldn't find it going tjrough Nashville."
"Lacks PIP, not useful. For people like me who depend on GPS on the road on a daily basis, it is critical that the map stays on top, regardless of what other tasks we may be using our smartphones for. It appears that Waze fans have been asking for rhis feature for several years and that Waze has aknowlged the requirement, yet to this date nothing has been done about it, which means that there are also gaps between what users want and what Waze customer service does."
"This is an awesome app! It warns me of hazards, traffic jams, and police! Google maps will never see me again! Unless I need to see a picture of my final destination. I like that it also allows me to report hazards, accidents, traffic, and etc. for other drivers on the road."
"Works really well, offline maps also working, routes are accurate and reliable. Great feature that Waze has is location of speed-cameras, police that are reported by other users. The only thing that is bad is really not changable but its the battery drain on every device (but if you have a good phone, battery saver works really well, on mid-range/budget devices battery saver doesn't really work that much and app becomes slugish/slow. But if you don't use it your battery will drain faster)"
We had some initial issue with using Waze because it would not always find a row apparently because of lack of access to it's servers. I do though use Waze a lot now and if you can find a way to define your destination rooting seems pretty good. There is lots of information displayed about stuff along the route although I don't know what most of it means. Support for finding ev charging locations would be a huge help to those of us with electric vehicles.
Audible App and music apps integrated gets 5‚òÜ. keeps me aware if I go over the speed limit+police locations+ construction areas+debris on the road and accidents notated by other users. works great w/my android compatible stereo with touchscreen. I just plug in my phone and connect via bluetooth! less memory-easy to see. find specific fuel stations/food you want along the way. cute icons are a bonus!
"Best app for driving, but the map isn't too accurate. Not very bad or anything, but sometimes because of a slight difference, the app thinks I actually did a full 180 so it takes a little bit to re calculate and the screen is just spinning. Doesn't happen too often though, just in a couple spots I know."
"I love this nav app. But it really needs an option for routes best for rvs or truck & trailers. I have this very winding road that leads to my house with a sign that says no trucks over 25 ft. and waze wants us to take it every time, there is an alternate route for long trucks but if you're following the directions and miss the little signs you end up stuck. Please add a feature for longer vehicles."
"Freezes up in android auto since July but still not resolved, googling suggests a bug was raised but still not fixed yet"
This use to be my go to app for navigation but not anymore. It is always freezing with android auto. I can't click on the alerts. It won't let me zoom in and out on the map. I even tried removing and reinstalling it. Until these issues get fixed I won't be reinstalling the app again.
From my local experience it's not up to date. Lots of great features but unfortunately It needs a active high level local community to work. I am not allowed to edit or report road closures from website. (Had to use the app at the location)A 4 month road closure still not added. The forum was very in-depth but out dated. Admittedly Google maps didn't have the closure either but they added the closure within hours of my report.
"What is Google doing to waze. It is getting super crappy. Doesn't sit on top, constantly crashes, which is oh so awesome when driving, doesn't know where you are when you start, (guess which way to turn) and closes when I call anyone or if I get a call through my cars bluetooth. I have been a huge lover and fan of waze since its creation. Why Google, you suck."
"This is a really good app when it works. It will tell you where accidents or stopped cars or traffic jams are and even reroute you, but it recently received an update. Now the voice no longer works, the background is now black so you can't see the roads anymore and the reroute now lags to the point that its sending you another way that's just as contested as the highway. If they could work out the operating issues then this app then it would be a top of the lime GPS system."
"Great app, but a great addition would be to show the address of the end destination on the screen."
"Was a solid 4 until the latest update in November, now on a Pixel 1 with android auto it almost continuously interrupts the music with voice prompts that do not say anything.  Making navigation unusable if you are playing anything else on android auto.  Works fine when not navigating.  Now it is unusable as a navigation tool."
"For the most part Wave is an amazing navigation app. My only issue is when I ride my motorcycle and when I use the app, I plug in the address and put the phone in my pocket and listen to the directions. Quite often, the app will not run in the background and it will actually close and stop giving directions. Fortunately, I look at the route and have a general idea of where to go. When the app closes, I have to pull over and reopen it. Can you please fix this?"
"What great and very reliable app for driving or even just finding a place to grab a cup of coffee or anything. My only criticism would be that you can not map your own routes, how Google Maps lets you. It would be a major asset if this could be included. One more thing, everyone need to contribute so we all have the most up to date information for our trips. -Smith"
"Waze is great... When it works, which is never since July 31. I've tried restarting, reinstalling, and finally resetting my phone. The gps gets stuck and the map freezes all the time. It's unfortunate because i want to like it more than Google maps, but it fails at its most basic task."
"When using with android auto Like another user mentioned, waze all of the sudden stopped showing my speed, the speed limit, map does not adjust zoom with speed, i am a blue dot, and just acting erratic since a few days ago. I cleared cache, force stop and the same result. The app works as expected on my phone, but not through android auto."
Does not show sometimes if there is radar or not and sometime do show . Just crossed the fixed speed camera but was not notified by app.please fix this .
"When I first used the app, it was great. However, now it rarely can find my location. Also, it is really annoying that when a friend shares a drive, it doesn't work. I only use this app when I am at home and starting a drive. It will give me an eta. Besides that, it is useless. It must have some sort of tech bugs."
"Still my number one navigation app. I do have one pet peeve: the max speed icon is too small, imo. It can be hard to tell if the max speed is 100, 120 or 130 km/h, at least on my car display using Android Auto. This could lead to dangerous situations."
"Recently it lags and crashes like 70% of the time when i open it, sometime the phone restart by its own when i open waze, please fix"
"I'm struggling to understand how this is better than either Google Maps or my built in Nav. I recently took a trip about 550 miles each way. I tried to use Waze before I left but it would not find a route because it was too far. I turned off the Avoid Freeways option before I came home a few days later and it only offered 1 route. 1. Since we are taking about NC to FL and back, Google Maps at least offers a 85/75 and a 26/95 option and usually a 3rd choice of some sort. Useless to me."
"Apparently my last review was deleted. There is a GUI issue when using Waze in landscape, the ""compass"" button is invisible but sharing almost the exact location of the ""report"" button. Please just move the button. Or better yet, make the button unable to be pressed unless the user has recently interacted with the map."
"Use it everyday for work, but when I updated it there is no longer a speed camera selection.you can mark dead animals and debris on the road which I really don't care about but not the speed cameras anymore. Thats the main reason I got this app. Will be going elsewhere unless its put back on. I do 1,000+ miles a week and you took away the best feature on the whole navigational system."
"With the latest update the GPS doesn't stay locked and bounces all over the place making the app unusable. This has happened in the past too, a couple years ago. Google maps works and locks the GPS just fine and a GPS toolbox app works just fine. I have rebooted, cleared the cache, etc. The Waze people aren't paying attention because I said my GPS works fine in other apps and it worked fine in Waze before the recent update."
"The app is often a few hundred meters off the road Im on, then constantly recalculates while I'm driving. Even after stopping, shutting down the app completely (Force Stop), then restarting. I wait for it to find my actual position, then retry the route. It bombs out in a few minutes. Bear in mind, I have stoped every other app on my phone to try avoid any conflicts... Other apps like Uber and Bolt dont seem to have the same problem on my phone though..."
"Before the recent update, this was the most reliable Navigation App available. However since ths update, Waze continuously loses signal, location and sync. Most odd, as Google Maps (owner of Waze) is still fully functional and works well - despite the lack of user interaction. Please Waze - sort out this bug!!!"
"maps traffic status is not correct. The car on the map does not move if the waze application does not have focus. for ex in a split screen mode if we are running YouTube and waze side by side and we touch the you tube app, waze map navigation animation freezes and car stops moving, however the voice navigation keeps running but the animation stops."
"1. Constant ""searching for network"" while every other apps work fine. 2. When I search for any location and the search results appear, it reverts back to ""searching"" mode when I select the location to start the navigation. Used to be good.... Sigh..."
"Waze tells you to turn right when you're 10m away from the turn. That's not very optimal when you're driving over 60km/h. I find the best use of waze is actually alongside Google Maps. It drains your battery, but using google maps and waze at the same time or interchangeably is amazing. I'd give 5 stars if the app were perfect by itself."
"Love this app, but there is so little information to put things right when the app isnt working right. Lost audio found that it was a simple issue of the volume needing to be turned up. Not in the app but using the radio volume button in the car. To do this you need to wait until you think the app audio should be playing and quickly turning up the radio volume dial. If you are lucky you catch the audio for the app and not the radio volume and you can hear the Waze audio."
"Best navigation app out there. Interactive, helps you avoid traffic jams and most importantly, POpo. It's 85 to 90 perfect effective at getting you to slow down when you need to. Tickets are expensive. *Tip, DON'T SPEED. *Hint. If the app says there's Popo up ahead and when you get to the location they aren't there, TRUST me, they moved further up the road, so still chill out."
Currently app doesn't show notifications but when you make a post it shows notifications was made by several other users.
"Good, but could be even better I have used this app for a few years now and find it very reliable, both in terms of finding the optimum route and calculating the ETA. HOWEVER - as one of the many drivers of an electric car, it's time it was updated to show charging points and not just fossil fuels."
"It's good app however there could be some improvements. 1. Road names, sometimes you are guessing which road to turn. 2. On-screen alternative routes, like Google maps, sometime you can go straight but it shows left, right so on. 3. No entries sign and one way signs on map would be very useful."
"As many other people have reported. The latest update has made the app totally useless through Android auto. Many bugs with freezing on black screen, reporting ""no data"" and with lagging and losing/ jumping location. Had this same problem in the past with other updates. Please fix so I can go back to using this app again."
"I agree with the most recent Waze users. The GPS signal...there is none. While I DO know how to read a map, it is too dangerous to reference your map or paper kr whatever rather than keeping both eyes and ears on the road. It's not practical. In its inception, Waze used to be on point, healthier confidence than with Google. This app used to provide real time updates, real time short cuts, and reroutes during heavy traffic. Waze has lost luster and user confidence"
"Ok at best, Google maps kept freezing on my S5, so I tried this app instead. although the information on route you will get seems pretty accurate, the navigation part of the app is not that great. often uses the longest route, there is no lane information you'll have to pay close attention where you're going or you can miss an exit and things like that. my mayor issue was that it got my phone very hot all the time to the point where it would close the app to cool down just after 15 mins."
"No customer support. I submitted a report via the app in October 2018 and received an automated e-mail response. The issue was corrected 3-4 days later. Early December, I submitted another app issue report because the same problem happened yet again. Again, I only received an automated e-mail response. 3-4 weeks later, the issue still has not been corrected. I've updated, reset, logged out and in...no luck. I will update this rating and comment when/if problem is fixed."
"Worst GPS app ever! Do not use! It often doesn't find a signal, even if you're 100% covered. It doesn't calculate routes properly. If you choose a different way than suggested, it takes you to a conplete detour.They completely ignore you if you have an issue and contact them."
"The directions are always clear and simple. Much better than other apps available. Tells you how long you'll be in traffic, option to re-route. Without WAZE i would be totally lost! Literally! Have no idea what i did before WAZE. Love the option of male/female voice & different accents."
"Okay, so this is awkward. I have been an abide Wazer for more than 5 years..... I never thought about adding a review of the app only because I felt that I never had the time. I would have given this app a 4 star review until today; hell, I used it over Google Maps! After the previous update though, things have changed. I used the app, as I do, for my long distance runs to see relatives and discovered that the GPS Triangulation has become ruined by the update. This means that where the app was capable of figuring out that you were within a specific radius of the current GPS tag and then taking your trajectory and momentum into account to determine your actual location and heading, to provide a fluid navigation experience; the current update has caused this software logic to crash and become nonfunctional. This leaves the app continually updating, eating data, and more importantly guessing your location and then altering your directions to redirect you to the route that you are already on. I was able to make it to my prime location the first time by ignoring the app inconsistencies and using the directions that I already knew. But then when I attempted to use the app to direct me to a short distance trip for coffee, it recommended so many wrong turns, and u-turns to correct for the wrong turns which it had just directed me, I became irate and was only able to successfully reach my destination through spoken directions given by my mother! If it wasn't for my mother I might still be lost in the journey to get coffee!!! So after my most harrowing of coffee runs and most irate of trips I was glad I didn't chuck my phone from the window going down the highway!!! This app is by definition unusable due to the poor quality of the previous software update. I am surprised Google allowed it to go live in this sort of disrepair. For that reason I am submitting a One Star review while sipping cold brew coffee and re-downloading google maps over Wi-Fi..... Because like I said, this app ate sooo much data having a stupid day that I am going to have to conserve the rest so I don't wind up paying for extra gigs from my provider!!! Thanks Waze.... You really DIDN'T help me!!!!"
"****EXTREMELY IMPORTANT - there needs to be an option, when picking the vehicle that your driving, to pick a truck(larger than a pickup 3) & when you are pulling a camper. I live on Long Island, New York where you are not allowed to go on any of the parkways if you have a commercial vehicle or are pulling a trailer. Waze always seems to want to put me on those roads and I have no way to pick a route around it. Please put those options options because I'm not thoroughly proficient at routing at"
"Sadly, Waze is about as reliable as a Boris Johnson promise. Constantly crashes at random. As a motorcyclist who only listens to the audio, I generally only notice this once I am a mile or so past my missed turn/ stop/ etc. This has happened to me on multiple android devices. My search for a reliable navigation ap continues..."
"New update made the voice to talk much much less. This is terrible. In a trip which it should have talked half the way, it only talked for 3 single sentence. I used to use the voice and not looking into map and it went well all the time. It was talking and showing me the way. But now after recently updates I went 3 wrong turns because the voice was silent and didn't talk when it should've"
Galaxy s21 ultra Android 12. While on Android auto the screen does not progress which makes it useless. Wanted to use it but had to uninstall
"Wasting time, not accurate most of the time"
"Works fine for me, on a Mercedes c class embedded navi screen. Advantage to Google map is the speed trap report. Community feature otherwise interesting but not necessarily always useful. The possibility to correct wrong speed limit would be nice as it's often wrong on portion where speed often change (reduced to 70 at crossing)"
"Totally wish it would work as described, it definitely doesn't. Using it in the Nation's Capital, it never gives me proper updates or routes. I am constantly suprised by traffic I can see, and it then tells me it's ahead. It also can't tell major route choices...as I come up upon a huge interstate, it doesn't give me an option for it, just the road I'm currently on. Only fairly useful thing is knowing where Police are, & who gives a hoot about every disabled vehicle, yet my song quiets every time"
Freezes constantly. Unusable.
"I like waze, but if you can use is on an iOS device. Is brilliant there, but buggy on android. When connected to android auto Waze loses my location when my phone's screen switches off. So to navigate anywhere I need to keep my phone alive.... kinda pointless and highly illegal. Good functionality in the app, but need to fix the integration with android auto. It's a killer."
"I need a walk option. Not everybody have a car. I live in a very large overly crowded city, so walking is the number one commute to getting around. That is my only complaint or need. Other than that minor issue. I love the color display with the playful icons. It's different and very, very user friendly. I just need that walk option please."
"Great idea, but the app has a lot of bugs, especially when there are multiple riders.. moreover no one cares to respond to the issue raised. Some bugs are reduced, but looks like the rules of car pooling with multiple car poolers need to be more flexible.. maybe a flexible range needs to be established to reduce drop out of the second rider."
"Overall a good app! However, I was stuck in traffic due to an accident and it did continue to re-route me 3 different ways back to the same road which had been closed due to the accident. Had to phone my boyfriend, who with the help of my dad, was able to get me to another route then waze updated the route options and I was able to then follow it home."
"This app is just waste of time. It will tell you ""no gps reception. Make sure you are outdoors."" I've tried it in the middle of the city on the streets. Where is outdoors? Does outdoors mean space for waze developers? To check if it was really gps issue I opened Google maps and it worked instantly. So waze sucks."
This used to be a great app until the recent updates. Now it either just goes waiting for data signal forever or it kicks me off and asks me to log in. Logging in with mobile number takes forever while logging in with username gives a failed login even after when I reset the password already. Uninstalled and reinstalled a lot of times. Rebooted device as well. Why break something that has been working? Google maps doesn't have the same issues.
"A lot of ""error calculating route"" messages recently. I've had to use Google Maps a few times. Force stopping sometimes helps but not every time. Please fix that. I never had so many problems trying to get somewhere with Waze before :( September 12 update: not sure if this is an Android 10 issue, but now the app always says that there is no GPS. It was ever since I gave it only while is use location permission but then I put it back to always on. Still says no GPS :( please fix this!"
"I give it 5 cuz it's well supported, nice interface, fast. But one problem - while I drive, when it asks me if the thread is still there, it's waaay before I reach the location - I have no visibility of the object - cops, accident, etc.. - I'm not a sniper with X-ray vision - momma & papa made me with base extras only.. When I reach the location of the happening - the dialogue buttons dissappear. I'd be more helpful to you & other users if this is fixed."
"Usually, the app keeps running in the background even after closing. Sometimes, I have to force quit or reboot my phone in order to get Waze to actually close out. It also seems to sometimes cause some music streaming apps to crash when it's the only other app that's running."
"GPS & data connected, but no maps would load & screen remained blank. UPDATE. Reinstalled app & tried again - same result. ""searching for network"" endlessly & no map. I appreciate the developer replying to my first review, but I don't use Facebook as I'm not a teenager, a conspiracy theorist or a loon, so can't take up their offer of contacting them that way. UPDATE 2 - I installed an older version which worked, updated to latest version & it started working üòä"
"Been using waze for a while now. Issue I have now is whenever I'm on Google and I hit directions to a place I've searched it opens waze but does not automatically set a course for that destination. How do I fix or please fix. I already tried clearing cache, data and reinstalling it. I have it set to my default so that that is what opens instead of Google maps."
Its better if offline navigation is enabled
This app needs to be updated because it is giving us wrong directions and we end up loosing clients. Sometimes It points you to turn to the left when you have to turn right. It sometimes you have arrived but the destination is about 500 meters away. I have tried to update on my side but it's just not working right. Thanks
"I love this app, perfect for driving in the city. I use it every day. The only problem I have is the difference between driving the Gardiner Express Way (above ground) vs. driving the Lakeshore (surface street). If there was a pop up to ask which road you are on, it would make traffic times more efficient. Thank you for keeping me on time!"
"This is the worst GPS navigation I have ever tried...   Early 2019 in North of Germany. Winter has arrived and there are many dangers for the adventurous driver to come from one place to another. After hearing so much praise - let's try...  Map coverage is poor. Main exits and entries to freeways (Landstrassen) are missing. Speed limits are missing for entire cities. Speed limits are missing for areas.  So, yeah, let's drive additional 15km as this simple GPS does not know the exits, entries of roads built 15 years ago. No problem. But hell, I DO know better...  When Tom Tom Go snaps to a new route in a split second, Waze gives you memories of the 80s. Just turn into an ""un-planned"" route and Waze re-calculates... and re-calculates... and re-calculates... and re-calc..? No! A new route has been found? Let's see? Oh, turnaround an follow the first calculated route again? Gnaaarrrghh....  Waze is being praised for community content of maps - okay, let's fix that. After signing up, after six days, after recording like 20 new routes - they simply do not show up on web editor. And yes, I am logged in with the same account details.  Never again. Back to Tom Tom Go."
"This was working great, until today. On our way home from Virginia, to Pennsylvania, both our phones kept getting routing errors. We like the up to date information, but several times, it sent us to place, we had been to before, and it wasn't the same place. Tried updating but still having same problem. Google is what we are using now, to get home."
"Please add feature to allow reports of closure of the road user is travelling on. Imagine when we can't report the road closed, Waze keeps beeping and recalculating and still directs you to the same spot no matter how you detour. There should be option for user to choose to adopt phone volume level for navigation guidance volume level. Just way too many taps to get to the setting item while driving."
"This application is very good, but the problem is that you can not save a lot of places. I have saved about 70 places now and it does not save more than that. The next thing is that you can not sort the places you saved For example, in another application, the option is named in order of distance or in order. You can even categorize For example, put the locations of one country in one file and place another country in another file. Solve these few issues, your application will be better th"
The maps are good enough. The warning are the reason most use it I'm sure. I just wish they would put hot spots on the map. Like a red see through circle in an area that has had a certain amount of accidents. Or Blue where there has been a siting of police 4 times in the last month or 2. Or traffic or... You get the idea.
"The best navigating app ever!! it shows you the way very clearly, it gives you updates about traffic jams according to the hour of the day, it gives you info about interruptions throughout the way, about cops and speed traps, etc... It also shows you the estimated arrival time to your destination and sometimes changes according to the variable traffic conditions. Briefly- Amazing and convenient."
Great app for navigation but when its in error mode it is a nightmare to fix! Bad Waze has spotty coverage on long trips or in heavy traffic. Reroutes are long and often take longer to get to destination. Lots of advertising while driving you can't see the screen or click out of. Not good! BAD WAZE!!
"Horrible. Today it gave me the worst shortcut. Instead of a good way that I knew, waze gave me the worst way with a lot of traffic. I'm very disappointed"
"It's great to get live updates from real people who use the app. Friendly interface, takes a little getting used to if You're only familiar with iOS, well worth the learning curve though. Admittedly I still use Google maps to find locations initially, but then just copy and paste the address two Waze."
"VERY helpful. Other drivers can send alerts on your routes that help you out like heavy traffic accidents bogies spotted üòâüòâ object in the road. And the drive times on freeways are very accurate drive time and Route in neighborhoods are less accurate than Google Maps I find. Also they have fun seasonal navigation voices and icons on the map, Waze is great."
"Great, however when using Android Auto on my phone (not the car screen) it exists Auto, so the bottom bar of controls goes away. Also when in landscape the map positioning becomes wonky. Like instead of the arrow going off to the side a little bit, it completely goes out of sight or off more toward the edge of the screen than it should. Hope a fix in on the horizon."
"Excellent gps app; been using it for years & love it way better then Google Maps until the last update. Since the update a few weeks ago, or whenever it was, the actual gps is all out of whack. My car or icon disappears as if I lost satellite signal and then will reappear. Lots of times, it'll reappear on a side street or side road way away from me. The icon will be sideways at times not facing the way my vehicle is actually facing. I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times. Fix this!"
"Advertisements for close by businesses pop-up while driving while using app...talk about a feature that is distracting while driving, do they want to make the driving experience more dangerous? Also, when closing app to ""shut down app"", it doesn't actually close down, just removes it from full screen."
Can be inconsistent that varies by area. Most of the time it is reliable but have had instances in NE PA where it sends you on very narrow windy roads that take much longer than if you would stay on the main roads even with longer distances. It seems to give distance sole preference over time and speed limits. One trip sent me down a single lane road that I think was someone's driveway...lol
"I tried to use this joke of an app while on a delivery run for DoorDash yesterday. The update ruined Waze completely! It constantly tells me ""No GPS. Showing approximate location."" as the map constantly spins around unable to find my exact location on the map. I will be switching to Google Maps from now on until this problem is fully resolved."
"Used to be a great app. Now I can't even log in without it hanging. I'll stick to the terrible Google maps. Firstly, I won't use Facebook and certainly won't be messaging. The issue is still an issue and also, the app drains more power than I can get back into the battery while driving. All in all, waze really is useless. Thanks for the reply but I don't use Facebook. How about just getting it fixed and also the massive battery drain?"
"Ok what is going on. Lately when I use Waze, it shows me all over the map. It constantly loses my location. It's almost like its lost in cyberspace. I am having the same black screen problem. Also the No Connection Error too. When I switch over to Google Maps, no problem at all. Please fix.. Using Android Auto and Samsung Note 8."
"Anyone else having issues ? I have been using Waze now for the past 6/7 years with very little issues until recently. Yes its a little heavy on the battery but its the best app by far. But over the last few weeks it just keeps freezing & the only way to get it back is to close it & re open which is a major bummer when you are driving !! I know recently google upset pretty much all apps with their update, but that has been fixed with their latest update & everything else is now good. Help !!"
"When using voice assistant to select a location, the voice assistant recognises the location but then Waze displays 10 locations on the screen which we have to manually choose from and then again press OK after that. It's very inconvenient when driving. With Google maps, we just have to name the location and off we go. I don't understand why the location selection is so clunky."
Continuosly trying to find GPS but GPS working fine on G maps ?
"This is great in concept. For me, its not working quite as well as I'd hoped for the following reason. I use android auto in my car and if I use Google maps, the car's inbuilt gps receiver ensures a solid gps fix but it appears that waze is still trying to use the phone's inbuilt gps so, combined with the phone's location under the centre console, I'm left with a very unreliable gps signal. I can balance my phone on the dashboard for a better signal but it would be much better if waze could utilise the cars gps receiver like Google maps does."
Waze take me around in a circle a keep saying rerouting this app need fixing i will never recommend it to anyone unless I heard of it been fix. Maybe because it free it useless üòï
I started using this app in 2017 at the recommendation of one of my cousins. It's real time but the actual from destination to destination is off on how long it takes.. For instance this past weekend we came from Missouri to West Virginia and it was 2 and a 1/2 hours longer than what waze said so something needs to be updated. And this is not the 1st time.
"Long time user of Waze and other GPS systems but I have 2 complaints. One is that it is slow to update. Usually it says ""Turn Left"" while passing the street I'm looking for after passing it, similariarily I have to wait for it to turn around and point the right direction coming out of a driveway or unmarked street. That was 1*, the other * deduction is for sending you down side streets or through neighborhoods sometimes with improperly maintained roads to shave 10 seconds off the ETA."
"For the past few months I haven't been able to establish a connection for GPS even though it can find my starting point. All other apps requiring location and GPS are still able to work. Have been too unstable to even use anymore. Although it was helpful with traffic and details in the beginning, would probably stop using until this gets fixed."
"Closes frequently in the middle of trips. Doesn't tell me to turn or exit until I'm past it. Changes from the route I chose to different ones in the middle of the drive. Doesn't always include the shortest trip options. Frequently gets ""confused"" and tells me to make all these wrong turns. Considering getting a Garmin."
"I like waze very much. I am having a recent issue with waze through Android Auto. It freezes. As soon as I put an address for a route it shows the route and speaks, but when you drive the arrow symbol stays put. Nothing moves. It has been consistent with this as of the past 4 days."
"Reason for my 2 stars are: Reporting issues are limited, speed cameras? Blocked roads? Can't add reports where needed, can't remove them either if put by mistake Has taken me down rabbit runs which, when I took, took me up to 20 mins longer than Google maps. Not good when trying to do a school run! Didn't reveal a car crash on my route to work, road was blocked by police. Tried to go an alternate route, kept trying to send me through the blocked road! Ads are very annoying!"
I love the Waze App. The real time updates and information about what's happening around us is so useful.
So helpfully and is this the app that u can talk to other cars with
"Tells you to take turns too late, mixes up off-ramps all the time, tells you to take an exit only to then change the screen that you had to take the next one instead. Aside from stuff on the road and cops, this GPS is relatively useless. Wish Google would just mash these together finally so we dont need 2 separate GPS apps. The accuracy of Google Maps with the social/updatable aspect of Waze."
Been using for about a month now overall I'm impressed. A few things that would improve the Waze experience. When not navigating to an address Highlight the current road / street you are on. When in Navigation mode advise your location when reached is on the right or left . A compass in driving display would be helpful.
"What is going on? This app is horrendous! It was working so smooth but my last few trips have been a nightmare. Map location is off, app doesnt want to find addresses and gives error messages on screen. I will have to delete the app until this problem gets resolved."
"Going downhill...misleading time estimates The last several times I've used Waze, the estimates for time are sometimes about 15 to 20% different from the same route in Google maps. Google Maps is always more accurate. I find this very misleading and have recently watched the time estimates creep up as my journey progresses even as I'm going at or above the speed limit and encounter no traffic delays."
"Could be better on memory and update roads status speed. The timings and suroundings for traffic jams needs improvements. Update: why good options not last long? It is complicate to explain the use cases. But the most annoying thing is that it is the most battery drainer from store, it will remain in the back till you remain very fast without. If started without gps it will stuck everytime but i think this is a known issue for years. Was best startup till was bought."
Waze used to be the best navigation app even better than google map. But recently the route it suggests are all through heavy traffic. This is very evident when showing routes around my local area where I am aware of the routes. It would send me around a block when I can just left turn out of my building to join the main road
"1.If you could add seeing friends on the map while driving as a group would be awesome..(guess it is in the app but only works with facebook account and can only see facebk friends.) There is share drive but cant see friends all the time while our route is on the screen. 2.if we could see how many radars in total on our route before we get on the road would also be perfect. Anyway it is a good app, thnx for the effort."
"There is still 2 search bars blocking the screen? and after months of requests to remove them nothing has been done. You only need 1 search bar which is a pop up, not 2 permanently blocking the screen. Plus there is NO SUPPORT from Waze after months of myself and hundreds of unhappy Users reporting this problem to them, nothing. (EDIT 08.07.22) thanks for responding, hopefully one of the search window will be removed, and the 2nd one converted to a Pop-Up so your screen is clear, thanks ü§ü"
It was working fine but suddenly it stopped working at all. I tried Uninstalling and installing again and when I open the app it looks like is going to work only to get a frozen black screen that won't even allow me to close the app. I have to open my recent apps and close waze from there. I used to love Waze. Didn't have problems until now.
"I‚Äôve used Waze for a while on and off but lately I‚Äôve been trying to use it with Android Auto in the car I have at the moment. At first it worked OK but in the past few weeks all I‚Äôve been getting is a Black Screen. If I set the destination on the phone first then plug it in I hear is the voice for the route. If I try to change to just google maps its impossible to get off the black screen at all. I‚Äôve cleared the cache and Data on Waze, I‚Äôve uninstalled both Waze and Android Auto."
"This app used to be awesome and worked perfectly with my android. The last update really was a huge step back. Ads get stuck on top anf won't show your directions or allow you to swipe music. You are unable to do anything in the app, its like everything freezes except for the car icon moves."
"Had the app for years on my Android. Recently the app would would not load, jus spinning and indicating give it a sec. No, it just would not load. Uninstalled and reinstalled and still same issue. Just delete app until the issue is resolved. I used this app all the time and to have it not work is disappointing üòï"
The latest update lots of user complained missing road name and partly of the map missing. Need to refresh the map frequently in waze setting. I also unable to disable the debug mode. I think it's better for Waze to run thru comments in fb. Rather wasting our time to put up the complaint thru the apps. There's no reverse for debugging mode. Have to reinstall the apps again. However the missing map happened on and off. Need to refresh the map.
"I have used this app in the past but stopped because I felt it was too much of a battery drainer. Want to try again but it will not install correctly on my phone. Have installed and un-installed 10+ times. Says needs to update maps, wait a sec, and just sits and spins. Will not work."
I love this app kway better then google or apple maps!! Everyone that has to get directions I always recommend that they getWaze. But I switched phones recently I switched back to a phone I used to use because I broke my other phone so I've had it on this phone I've never had an issue with it before but all it does is showing me loading the speedometer works but that's it I can't touch anything it's just the circle spinning over and over again I've tried deleting and reinstall no luck help pls
can we get some apple music support for the android version? other than that it's a 5 star app. also if you're having issues with the app shutting down after you turn off your screen go to you settings select the app then battery and set it to unrestricted. you can blame Google for that one as you'll probably have to do this everytime you update to a new version of Android.
"It's excellent, only removing a star because the interface is kind of unoptimized for large screens, there is 3 bars in the bottom of the screen and the status bar shows up in black, and there are two search bars for some reason... A full screen immersive mode would be great."
"never install this trash had it for 2 years and the ""kinks"" (app crashing with no notifications, poor map layout, distractin ui almost causing accidents instead of preventing them with the road issues ""feature"", choosing a different destination the the one you chose while you're already ON ROUTE, no updates or redirects when the app itself misguides you on your route. this app is awful and for it being halfway through 2022 you should waste LESS time on other maps apple, Google, even Ubers bet"
"Was a perfect app. Lately a lagging headache. Turn on Waze, half of the map is loaded and location not showing up, have to close and open the app again in order for it to work. Then sound notifications of police, railroad or a hole ding after you pass the marked area most of the times."
"This App works great. One of the best I've used. Also like the extra features like debris on the road, vehicle stopped on shoulder, accidents, and speed traps. With a large amount of users these features are more accurate and makes it nice."
"Dodgy routing and horrible ad integration. I understand you gotta make money, but an ad that pops up and fills the screen while driving, covering up the Google assistant and music player buttons and is UNREMOVABLE makes the app unusable on an older car with no android auto capability. Not to mention you can find yourself driving on an old country blacktop road with no paint or lights because it's a direct line is still a scary proposition as you are now 30 miles from the nearest gas station."
"Cannot plan a drive. Sometime it is excessive calculating routes. Update, seems I cannot add a stop,fuel, or restaurant while on a trip. I am compelled to reinstall but for some reason I can never recover all my saved locations. Frustrating."
"It's a joke really. None of the warnings are ever where they say they are.Navigation is awfull: it will send you on pothole filled backroads instead of the main road if ""it thinks"" it will save you a minute on your journey. And whats the deal with all the smileys, friends and points? I don't care about stupid stuff like that.Seriously, if you want a decent navigation just stick with google maps."
"This app has turned to garbage... I loved waze, I have been having the same issue most are having; annoying ads, constant drops in GPS, maps taking 5 minutes or more to load. Nothing seems to be done to fix it, so i have to resort to google maps. I will have to saldly continue using google until waze decides to address and fix these app breaking problems."
"This app was supposed to be unique from other GPS apps by the real-time updates from other users, but it's a perk that becomes moot if you can't connect this to a touch screen on your radio, or it's against the law to have your phone while driving. For simple GPS, stick with what's already on your phone."
"Since last Update download the app on Android auto has been poor. Frequently the screen goes black except for the top part , it also stops giving route guidance for no reason. Had to select other options for Android auto instead of my trusted friend wase. Maybe undo the last update please."
Would be better than google maps with its cool functions if it had a decent navigation system. It often shows wrong address and shortcuts which are totally pointless nevertheless slower than google maps. Deleting waze will save me from having constant headaches when driving.
"Waze used to be good but lately it has been routing me through accidents. I've reached my last straw with this major accident that completely shut down a busy freeway for over 3 hours and Waze tried to tell me it was a five minute delay. Ended up costing me over an hour in traffic and rerouting, when I could have taken a different route from the start."
"It is never even remotely accurate around Washington D.C. It will say things like experiencing unusually high traffic and add minutes to the proposed trip. It is NOT unusual, it is the same level of traffic EVERY day. It seems Waze just gave up on their algorithm, it's a shame. Back to Google maps for me."
"Still, after a year not fixed. If you have Waze running in the background while using another app, when you return to Waze, it's locked up with a black map on the screen. You need to force stop the app to get it to work again."
"Constantly stops working when using android auto and prevents other apps working. Great app when it's working used too use a lot for work, if it gets sorted will definitely reinstall. Could also have done with a way of updating the map such as correct location of house, business or even a new build."
"Love this app, I think y'all should add a ""new driver"" mode. Where y'all have stop signs, red lights and stuff spoken by the Waze announcer as if ur turn was coming up. Y'all would be the first to do so. I'm a new driver myself and rely on this app but I still struggle with knowing exactly where stop signs are if I'm coming over a hill. It's just a little idea which I think would really boost ur apps reputation more than it is and it would help a lot of new drivers learn the lay of the land. :)"
Beware of this app because lately it'll tell me to go backwards or make u turn or do something I don't need to do like go right when I have to go left or I'm at a traffic signal that allows left hand turns. The other issue is if you have several rep of several reports it doesn't like that but if you're in an area where there's construction or multiple hazards including a car accident I'm sure other drivers would like to know that.
"I see a lot of potential in Waze as a route planner, but so many of its functions and features are just so over the top bad. It somehow manages to do more than Google with its many exciting concepts, but it's just surprisingly terrible."
It was great app but two things makes me sick: - after default installation the default mode is taxi (why???????) After I find out why waze during whole journey had skipped most highways or motorways even if I had correct pass added. Waze should reimburse my pass because of that! - there is no feature like do not route via that country or city
"Ads while driving is not safe. This app will at random draw an ad over the application, making it so you can't see the map anymore, and it requires you to take attention away from the road in order to close the ad by pressing a pretty small button."
Roadside hazard information is nice. If no one in the area is using it the information it shows is either missing or wrong such as speeds and construction. Occasionally it will send you on a longer route than you actually need to take.
"It's easy to use, it gets me where I'm going, it warns me of accidents, police and traffic cameras, it notifies me when it's for me to leave from the info on my calendar so I can arrive on time and I can play Pandora and Spotify straight from the app. I like it way better than Google maps."
"I used to replace Google maps, feel that was an bad idea, first impression is worst. Interface and features are good, but roots are and rerouting is worst, Google shows short root around 26 Km, but Waze shows 53km, I am femiler with this root, and my second concern is the root which Waze shows there is one bridge on revier damaged completely 10 year back, that brigde is in construction (not opend yet)."
"I just tried this app again, tried it a few years back. I uninstalled it because it didn't show me the route options. Again I will uninstall because the annoying lady talks about the route, but they didn't show me on a map my choice of routes."
"Waze had me going in circles today. I had people beeping and arguing with me because I was traveling the same route over and over again. The frustration others had with me, was that I was hoping Waze would snap out of its loop and give me the proper directions. Finally, I just started driving straight and it all came together. This app can cause confusion, impatience and disagreement on the road. It is not the first time I've been on a merry-go-round with Waze. Please fix this."
I don't know what's going on with your app. It was working perfectly until 3 days ago and now it just keeps trying to load and never does which sucks for me because I used it mostly for my job now I'm forced to use Google Maps. I had given this a 5 star rating but now I can only give it one. Yes I have tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it powering off my phone and turning it back on and every other logical solution.
"Ads, ads, and more ads, but what else do you expect from a Google product. Plus no background support yet. The worst things about the ads is that they cover almost the whole map when they randomly appear when DRIVING."
"Love the app, but it's disappointing you can only add one stop to your route. I'm used to Google's multiple stops when I have more places to stop before my destination, and I can see the whole trip at once."
"I installed this app after a year and it feels bloated, prefers popups about personalized ads over safety of driving (I have to close it while driving) I had to fight the app to use it without logging and it avoided highway for no reason. Really disappointed about how this app turned out."
"I've been quite happy with waze but recently it stopped working So I uninstalled it and reinstalled however I lost all 8 years of data, points, and destinations. I have been unable to find any user support that can help with this. Disappointed."
"This app works Sooo much more precise, easier than Google maps and I find the settings such as , avoid highways, multiple routes, and we have the ability to give updated reports on accidents, police for those who miss a turn single here and there :) I give it a Huge Thumbs Up!!!"
"Deleting people's reviews? How childish of you. App is complete garbage on my new samsung s22 doesn't know where I am half the time and for some strange reason despite setting it to avoid toll roads its tried numerous times to send me to the toll road, and when it's not doing that its busy trying to get me to exit at every single possible exit for no reason whatsoever. Last drive I shaved off 12 minutes by blatantly disregarding it for 20 minutes and exiting at a road I recognized."
"Update, my Waze is working again. I guess I just had to be patient, perhaps when activating waze with a new phone using an existing user account took time to complete and rendered it temporarily unusable. After a day, it works fine. Thank you for reaching out."
"Absolutely unusable w/ Google Assistant. Since Google added Google Assistant in Android Auto we can not use Waze speech recognition making it useless on languages which Google Assistant does not know about. Somehow it is perfectly fine for Google Assistant to know 4 dialects of German, 7 of Spanish, or 4 for French but I can not use the language of the application because someone thought it would be a good idea that Google Assistant overrides every input. Not only that but you can't turn it off"
"The new updates are really good. When a faster route is found now it asks before re routing. Line guidance in voice is awesome. Options to choose from many routes with distance and time displayed. Live updates on hazards, what more I can ask for?"
Unfortunately for the last couple of months I've been having serious issues with the waze it's always showing no GPS nor correct location üòï I have uninstall reinstall everything seemed to work but then when I try using it again I'm back having the same issue so I have to install to reinstall every time I want to use whiz I tried the steps that you gave me and it doesn't work
"I always use this app. Lately it's been acting up. Sending me round a about ways. I recently cleared the data/cache to see if that would help. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Now it doesn't work at all. It just spins and says ""just a sec..."""
10 miles out of your way to gain one minute around a slow down isn't really an improvementwhen you consider the wear and tear and increased frustration and anxiety. Switching back to Google Maps. Quickly.
Usted to be user friendly. Have to press start drive 20 times till you get annoyed and try to leave the app THEN it shows the route. If on a rush or need to change routes quickly don't waste your time using this. And it was really good.
What is going on with waze? I can't check the best times to leave anymore it just doesn't come up since the upgrade! Why upgrade something that was perfectly fine!! So annoying cos now I can't figure out when to leave and that was the main reason I used waze for!!! Iv even uninstalled and reinstalled it. How annoying!!
"I generally prefer this to Google maps, but recently when I switch apps then switch back to Waze, I lose GPS and have to close and restart Waze, then start my route again. This is super inconvenient, so until this is fixed I'm switching to Google maps for now"
I like Waze alot it's easy to use has alot of cool features. the only thing that knocked a star off is the app always asks you to click something. road work still there? someone needs help on the left are they still there. obviously if I had that button I lose my driving licence straight away
"Privacy invasion and monitoring are the default settings in the Waze app. I downloaded the app because Google maps started bugging out on me, but as it turns out same owners same bugs. Edit:No, i don't have Facebook and the link provided doesn't load"
"No longer works Used to be amazing, my nav app of choice, but since about mid August it just doesn't work with android auto. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled it today and it just doesn't track my journey, shows me as static at the start of my journey on the map. No longer use this app, changed to Google maps."
"Epic. I've got ADHD and this has changed the way I drive. After my last $1073 fine for phone and $300 speeding fines, I bought myself a magnetic phone holder and found WAZE. Speed alerts right in view on the phone to remind me if I'm not paying attention and pretty much always shows where police are in real time because it prompts all the other people driving past to confirm if police are still there. I think it alerted every one I saw except mobile Hwy patrol. Improved my driving immediately"
Didn't connect properly with Rideshare App.. As of maybe 6month to a year I've started to experience this issue.. when a ride request come thru I accept and it should automatically connect and start navigate me to the location but as of now I have to tap it go back to the Lyft app tap navigation again and it still doesn't work I have to hit Waze hit Lyft hit Waze close the app out then hit Lyft again then hit navigation for it to connect.. I've uninstall reinstall the app so many times
"If I were doctor strange and able to teleport both me and my car to a parallel street off the motor way, I would give this app 5 stars. Seeing as though I'm unable to pull off such imaginative maneuvers, added 15mins and a few unnecessary road tolls to my trip."
I've used this app for 10 years and it was great up until the last few months. It sends me on ridiculous routes that add 20-40 minutes to every drive over an hour...for comparison my brother put the same destination in on Waze and it gives him much quicker route
"IMHO better than ""the other"" when creating routes. Provides options similar to other but more fun to use. Designed for driver and passenger, NOT for bikes or riders of public transportation. Learning curve isn't too bad, mostly unlearning habits established from using other. üòè"
I'm not sure what this problem is over the past year but unless it is actively on top and the screen is on the app will close itself. I have disabled optimization and app sleeping with no change. Makes it fairly useless.
It used to be my default maps app but lately I get nothing but missing graphics on the maps (roads and info missing randomly) and random crashes and reboots. I have no choice but to go back to the inferior Google maps.
"Whenever you try to open waze with spotify, it will force restart your phone. Afterwards, everytime you try to open waze, it will just blackout and force restart your phone again. The only u can do is just to keep on reinstalling the app just to use it :)"
It takes me on dead end roads often. It also had put me in traffic for about a week straight then it corrected itself. Then the app turns off then restarts without the address entered. Beem using it for about 3 years or so and it used to be fantastic
"I'm (finally) happy to say thank you for fixing the Assistant integration! Yay! Your app is usable,again. Good luck with OS 13! üòüüôè"
"Love this Waze app, but miss being able to see all my fellow Wazers sharing the road with me, like before all the updates. Really dislike the ""car pool"" screen that keeps getting in my way if i touch/swipe the screen by accident. Why is there no option to opt out of this?? It is annoying and distracting while driving. PLEASE FIX THIS! Also, not everyone has a Facebook account. Waze requires this to link to your Wazer friends and family.... Fix these things, I will give 4STARS again. REPLY: no FB"
"Absolute garbage. This app constantly redirects, and is slow to update when I make turns. The straw that broke the camel's back was when I put in directions to go to the metro station and it literally said I arrived at my destination in the middle of the highway right next to the railroad not the actual station. How much more dumb can you get, this app literally had one job and it managed to screw it up royally by adding almost 45 minutes extra to the drive."
"Fantastic navigation app, especially when it links to other apps like circuit, i use this to help navigate from job to job all over the South of England and its never let me down once, the auto route updates when theirs an accident ahead avoiding long delays and the choice of routes it gives you even when you're partway through your journey make it just that much more brilliant! Bonus Candy Ahead!"
"I set up an account and all was well until it didn't record achievements. I drove over 100 miles and nothing. Drove 5 days in a row with multiple routes....nothing. The kicker was when I had an attention notice to register. I contacted cs and they said I was registered. They asked for a ton of personal credentials that aren't required for the app. I deactivated and deleted the app. Wasn't worth the hassle. Quite frankly, it's not worth my time to even write this"
"Gives convoluted routes frequently as compared to Google Maps. Thus, I would confirm route with Google Maps before committing to Waze. Re-routes without warning. Takes long time to calculate longer routes. However, love the police and traffic warnings Waze provides. 8/17/2019 Took me on an incorrect route. Once i got there, I was told to turn back and drive back to where i came from! Update 1/15/2021 Still the same convoluted route through inner roads rather than mostly on Interstate."
Won't work with the new Samsung galaxy. Auto defaults everything to Google. Bring back the old waze
"Great app! I have a suggestion for improvement:  If Waze decides to re-route me due to traffic or accident, the app should tell me what's going on AND allow me to choose to maintain my current route or accept re-route. I hate when I""m going somewhere I know how, and Waze tells me out of the blue to take an unexpected exit. I never know if I should trust Waze or not. A couple times it really messed me up, costing me hours.  I'll often just turn it on without entering a destination. I still receive hazard reports but don't need directions."
Brilliant satnav. There are only 2 downsides. 1st its not offline. 2nd it crashes on routes longer than 300 miles (at least on my phone). Still I'm giving 5 star because real time traffic update is fantastic. Especially when you have active drives on same road while your journey. Reporting issues/problems on road is easy and intuitive. I can recommend this satnav application to every one with decent mobile contract - 1GB per month is more than enough for this app. Download it NOW! Be Happy!
"Used to be my favorite app but last 6 months it's been awful like everyone else says. Sometimes when I plug it into android auto it just does nothing. Sometimes it cant find network, sometimes it just spins calculating the route and never stops. Please fix this or just wrap all it's cool features into maps since you own them both anyway."
"I love this app, however, I'm constantly having to uninstall and reinstall it. After a short while it does the same thing, over and over. ""Waze is trying to connect to GPS"" despite my location and all the jazz being on. I have friends with the same issue (they have iPhone I have Android). Can we figure this out maybe?"
"Best driving GPS ever tested. + local community is in most areas, even in small ones, very active + all common features: notifications for events linked to your callendar or on facebook ; links with audio apps like spotify... + features can be turned off + taxi mode - no offline maps (Waze could even include downloadable traffic updates if, you have no mobile data e.g. in other countries) - sometimes Waze sends you on the wrong side of your destination -> + you can send error reports"
"Doesn't learn or provide the fastest route anymore. I drive the same way to work every day, which uses a toll road. I have driven this same route for over a year now. The 3 options it gives are surface streets and feeders that take 20 minutes longer and are similar mileage or another toll road that is 15 miles further and takes 10 additional minutes than the route I take. I just want an accurate eta and traffic before I leave my house, but no. Get it together, you used to be better than this."
"Great app overall. Gives real time updates which is excellent for avoiding traffic jams. Accurate appox 95% of the time, so be mindful of that. In addition, if you are not a comfortable driver i would recommend enabling the ""avoid difficult intersections as waze takes you down lots of side streets which bring you out onto busy main roads which you often have to edge your way out of to cross over and continue your journey."
"Used to always use waze all the time, but more and more these days it reroutes you miles along tiny back roads to save 3mins but it ends up taking you 20mins more, can there be an option to ask before rerouting or only do if it saves you more than X mins. I think the issue is that it thinks unclassified roads you can do 60mph on which you usually can't."
Terrible since November update. Similar to others the app is currently terrible. Used to be my go-to but now I use Google navigation. I have a OnePlus 7 pro. Problem is with Android auto. Won't use GPS correctly if launched first. Have to use Google navigation then go back to Waze. Even then there are random blackouts and resets of app. Please fix! I loved this app but don't use it at all in it's current broken state.
This app makes me confident to drive places I would never have gone to on my own. So easy to use and so accurate.
This app was the worst. It kept changing the route as I was driving and even took me the wrong way down a one way off ramp to the free way. Traveling someplace unfamiliar is bad enough but constantly getting the wrong directions mid drive is unacceptable from an app that is meant for proper driving directions. Will never use this again.
"Is anyone else havig GPS issues? Other tracking apps are working. Waze never had these issues prior to google acquisition. It is so bad that it is tracking off road or on parralel roads to the freeway i am on. This used to be a rated app, but it is unusable. Life 360 works fine. I believe google maps does also. But my Waze history has all that i need."
"Garbage app. The directions you get from the audio are always last minute and will say to turn right when you are supposed to turn left. I thought I was going crazy at first, but after focusing on it I can honestly say that 1/20 directions will tell you to turn the wrong way. On top of that, the automatically changing routes will drive you nuts if you are anything like me. I dont want to think I'm taking one route and then end up on a street I wasnt expecting to take."
App is sticking when driving around and isn't smooth. Was fine before update.
"I hate this app. It does not use any common sense. I don't want to drive 10 miles out of the way to save 2 minutes. Heck, I don't want to drive 5 miles out of the way. And I definitely don't want to drive through some uninhabited back road, or rough dangerous looking neighborhoods just to save a few minutes. Uninstalled this stupid app."
"Waze is not working properly in Android Auto since the Samsung system update (S10 plus) a few days ago. Auto zoom does not work, speed is not shown, the arrow for your car is often pointing the wrong way and the map constantly repositions. Waze is completely unusable like this. This problem needs to be rectified. 4/15 update. This problem was resolved with an android auto undate a few weeks back."
"Like putting directions in and then having the app change your destination to ""work"" automatically? Enjoy voice commands that rarely work? Want pop up ads when you're trying to see where you're going? Estimated arrival times that are NEVER correct? Then this is the app for you!"
"Nice app but it needs Samsung music integration, less ads & up-to-date map. I use it everyday but using it with Samsung music, it cuts out the music from Bluetooth to my device's speakers. The map need to be updated as most times police & other stuff on highway is not updated. It can also use a lot less ads while App is opened"
"Excellent app. Way better than Google Maps (shows speed limit, alerts about hazards on/nearby roads, etc). It just looks a bit flimsy and outdated and the ads/prompts are somewhat disruptive sometimes. If I could buy/subscribe to get rid of ads I'd do that in a heartbeat."
"It has become unusuable. This app used to be amazing, but for some time it is horrible, taking you in circles, saying to turn right when there is no street there, recalculating right before taking a shoulder to a bridge and so on.Both on a Samsung 8plus and a Note8 and 9 this has been happening for some time now. Unistalling, as it is no longer safe to drive with this app."
"I use Waze on almost every drive Whether I know the route or not, Waze helps me stay a step ahead of regular traffic, accidents and construction; from speed traps to potholes to idiots. Hands down, the most useful smartphone tool for the road. User friendly interface by keeping it simple. I would like to see the ability to mark obstacles and hazards on the other side of the road, like you can police."
Works great There are some buggy issues but nothing serious Perfect for long drives and for areas you aren't familiar with
"I love the app, and it usually knows the best way to go. I love that I can alert others of hazards, and they can alert me. The one thing that could be improved on is when indicating there is a crash or other hazard, there is a section to type something but if I'm driving alone I can't populate. It would be great if we could click on buttons to indicate where the hazard is (right lane, center, or left lane, or right or left shoulder). This way we won't be ""texting while driving"". Thanks"
"Nice to have all the community input for speed camera locations and other live traffic events that occur, but would be nice to be able to explore the map, like with Google Maps. Also, adding a stop along the way is not as seemless as Google Maps."
As the cat icon was returned I change the rating to 4 stars. One star less for not very optimal route selection. It would be good if user can set at what trafic delay he wants to be navigated to another route. For example I would rather spent 10 minutes in traffic jam on a highway than go through alternate route that in realistic conditions takes 30 minutes (by waze 5 becouse it probably counts with full speed and good straith roads).
"really bad. i've check my phone. connect with internet, turn on GPS and even reboot my phone for better connection. but it seems that waze still cannot detect my location and provide me with a correct direction. not to mention the loss of connection even though im using the latest updated version of waze and my internet connection is 4G. this happened several times. please fix it."
"This is the app I just don't understand. it's a better map than Google Maps. It's made by Google but has more ads. But has a crappier UI it was the first interactive map, but it doesn't have the notification drop down when app is minimized (turn here)notification, like Google Maps does, but you have the technology being you are the same company. , you just lazy?Also stop redirecting us to talk to you on Facebook, like google, facebook is part of the government twisted evil. Death to facebook."
"The ACCURACY is not accurate. Sometimes road that are not passable, this app tells us to use that way."
"I give one star to have the attention of the developer. I start to drive and I have internet connection, later during the way I don't have internet or I just turn data off. Later when I have internet the app it's still searching for connection and it's offline. It happened many times. With GPS, when I start to drive it asks me to turn on the location and it doesn't find the GPS signal, even after driving for a few km. I reported the issue and they answered sending a link how to use gps. funny"
"Waze used to be useful, but it is trash now. It sends you on the worst route. When I take the suggested route, 30 minutes gets incrementally added to my travel time. When I bypass all their recommendations. I get there faster. So, maybe it is useful in telling you where NOT to go."
"Used to be OK, but the language reverts to wherever location you are at. For example, I'm currently in Israel, but when I type an address, everything is shown in Hebrew instead of the language set on the phone. It will be nice to have a feature to download maps for offline use."
"Not working well since last update. Now it crashes more, says it can't find the network, takes forever to build routes, builds the wrong route and takes me down roads I know are not faster. Last update also broke the volume during a call, it's super loud now, louder than the call I'm on, and it can't be adjusted."
"Just got new stereo with android auto and Waze is permanently running in the background whether I like it or not. Calling out for red light cameras or speed cameras and interrupting music playing. Obviously I can turn off sound but then I have to turn it back on to use it, and then off again, and it still means it's eating battery and data. How do I turn Waze off? Other than uninstalling it..."
Could ne better. Getting tired of ads ...
Terrible app. Always loads with error. Slow and unresponsive on a high end mobile. Won't update and forced me to do research. Total waste of my time. Found an easier solution: Uninstall Waze. Problem solved. Will check back in a few months and update review accordingly. For now I give this app one out of five stars. Cheers!
"I really wanted to like it. I really did. I hate Google maps, but waze is somehow less intuitive and more frustrating to use than even that massive train wreck. Unless you plan your entire life around your GPS app, the way waze works will probably forever elude you. As for me, I use it maybe once or twice a month and it never seems willing to do what I really need it to. Guess I'm going back to Google with my tail between my legs. At least Google won't start up my Spotify for no goddamn reason."
"would be a great app if there is an option where we can select ""from"" location too like google maps have. there is big wall next to my apartment and when waze takes start location from there route is totally wrong and totally not related trip estimation comes out. also maybe I want to check the route for someone else(?) their server quite slow most of the traffic time no server response which makes it quite useless sometimes."
"This used to be the best app. Not anymore. I have turned up late for meetings several times because waze keeps saying "" No GPS connection"" . First I thought it was my internet connection but I had YouTube playing without any problem. Then I thought I needed to update waze. I updated the app but the problem is still there. I thought it was because I'm using an old phone ( samsung s8+) but it appears many people are facing this same problem . So annoying"
"Lately I have a problem with this apps... Every time I use or open it, my phone will suddenly turn off or hung... O thought is just once, but then I used it again my phone turn off while I'm in the mid of important things to do... What happen Waze? I'm afraid to use this anymore because it's not normal to turn my phone off when I'm on using this apps.... It's there anyone else who experienced same like mine????"
"No longer speaks if phone is off and using it just for alerts. Doesn't show time of alternative routes when driving like Google Maps. Please change the ""Still there"" YES button to green color and the NO button to red (ease of use)."
When I downloaded the app and opened it said allow to use location I said allow and now for the past 20mins it's been stuck on a loading screen saying just a sec
"Used to be great... This app has seriously degraded in its usefulness. Frequent crashes/ has issues ""adding a stop"". I have come to rely on Google Maps especially since they added ""speed trap"" reporting. Also, please adjust your settings to remove the Carpool Advertisement as it is not a feature I would use as it doesn't fit my work style"
I do have a black screen on the car w android auto. changed the cable but same. google maps works ok though.
Not good since last update speed camera issue's
"Cute but Useless. I want an app to navigate with voice commands through Android Auto and this one sux. I give it an exact address and it takes me to a huge list of possible locations with that include one or more words from the address I gave. Invariably, half way through the list is the address I gave it. Hardly a safe and easy way to navigate while driving. Bye Waze."
"driving hazard at first this app works fine, but after several updates, it keeps on rerouting randomly. it keeps on getting its gps signal lost even though I have a full signal reception. tbh its a driving hazard, the way it suddenly loses its gps lock and rerouting even if you're just stopping in a traffic light. the randomness is something that is a hazard and must be fixed"
"I used to use Waze all the time, but after my latest trip- Never Again. Leading me through an hour of back roads to avoid 5 minutes of traffic is ridiculous. And also, if I missed a turn it would just completely reroute me instead of advising me to simply turn around. This again, added more time to an already long road trip. Since I was unfamiliar with the area, I had no idea how ludicrous these reroutes were until I had spent another wasted hour on side streets. I'll just stick with Google."
Crashes constantly on long routes
"I'm not sure what's going on with this app, but I cannot put waze into the background as it loses gps signal and then exits. This isn't related to my phone as I've tested this on other devices with the same issue. My permission settings have location allowed, so I'm not sure what's happening. The only fix I've found is to allow the app to use my location ""all of the time"" instead of ""while using the app"" which has never been an issue before. Please fix."
"This app started sending notifications even though I hadn't opened it and wasn't using it. Tried to disable the notifications but they still kept coming. Tried to force close the app; still notifications. It was a useful app, but I'm not driving much anyway due to the pandemic so I guess I'll just uninstall. Real shame."
App is not starting. It show screen just a sec and round circle and an not able to click anywhere
"The Waze service on Android Auto could use some attention: 1. The speed limit needs to be a large icon/don't; make the same size as Google Maps speed limit in Android Auto. 2. In Android Auto, directions for upcoming turns and road names does not complete, it will just stop, almost like being interrupted mid sentence. Please address these issues."
"2‚≠ê Because extremely difficult to Add Stop & no Add trip To Homescreen. Have to close/reopen to change selections. Feels stressfully restrictive, but Doesn't forget to tell you when to turn. Hasn't been intoxicated all day like GüëÄgle Maps, Doesn't send you on a different route, for the same place, each time in order to cover up ETA inaccuracies. Waze ""share"" goes to everything else but your Homescreen where you need it most, so get there quick outside the app is by using GüëÄgle MAPS.. ugh!"
"A great app with room for improvement One major issue with the app is ""reluctance to direct drivers the opposite direction, eg I had to go to an island where a ferry would need to transport me and the car across the river. I didn't proceed to the island again, but when I opened Waze to put a new address, Waze still insisted that I go all the way to the island just to make a u turn. Another issue with Waze is some times it does not recognize that you have changed route if going same direction"
"I have an issue when a route is entered a message on top ""No GPS - showing approx location"". It just sits at the start location and does not find a GPS signal. This has been ongoing for the last 4+ months. Have emailed developers - no response. Have Googled a lot - still no resolution. After every update, try again - still not fixed. Frustrating! Edit to response - been there - same issue. Other NAV apps work fine like Google maps, Here so it's definitely Waze not being able to find GPS signal."
I was really pleased with this app until the 'Ok Waze' voice activation was turned off. Now I can't contribute as I can't add notifications when I am driving on my own which is most of the time. Makes the app a bit redundant. 04.05.2022 update ongoing issue with voice notifications and after submitting logs waze support are unable to recreate my issue and do not seem to want to help further. üòï
Totally unreliable only give this one star for the nice functions it has Multiple times it has directed me on a route that ends in me needing to walk at the end. I counted at least 3 times when it directed me straight into the worst traffic and only indicated the delay once I commit to the route (as in I couldn't take an alternative). All 3 times I know for a fact other routes were faster. All 3 times I missed (not late) missed appointments. Rather use Google maps
"I've always used whatever Nav App came with my phone. usually Google Map this App was AMAZIMGLY better!! It was extremely accurate. The only time it had to recalculate was when we were in a twisty curvy mountain road part of our trip. It gave heads up for road hazards, accidents, sneaky hidden cops and disabled vehicles on the side of the road. It tells your speed and the speed limits as you travel. May even use it for my daily drive to work now!"
"I used to prefer using waze over google map. However lately i really dont understand waze algorithm. Lately waze always guide me to a longer route, with no reason at all. For example, i know already the best, fastest route to my destination, but I turn on waze for traffic info. However waze keep directing me to another longer route. When i keep going with my own route, there are no problem on the route at all. At certain point only waze give up and recalculate to my route. Not so reliable now."
"Using with Android Auto and latest update has screwed up the car audio, when you connect a route, every couple seconds the volume changes from the car audio volume level to the Waze notification volume level, it's unusable. If you cancel the route the switching volume stops even though Waze is still running."
"6yrs of account was messed up and had a split brain with email and Google login although they both used the same email address. Ended up deleting the account in the last resort and afterwards can no longer create a new one with the same email, just says that there's no network connection, which is bs. Sad but moving on to other platforms."
"After 20 miles of driving, it still say I am home. Can't report anything since it doesn't know where I am. This happens 99% now. It used to be great. Tried everything. Reinstalled. High location accuracy. Enable location service permission. Still disappoint on every trip."
"Absolutely horrible. I'm forced to use ways by my tow fleet. Ever since all drivers were forced to start using it the dispatch radio is constantly going off because of how lost waze is making the drivers. Waze is great at picking a complicated and convoluted route, a 5minute drive can easily become a 10minute drive if you go by what waze tells you. The constant pop up ads are a major distraction. The road hazard and traffic warnings are often off and delayed, making that feature useless. Pathetic"
"Terrible experience. The location of my car doesn't update as I drive. It takes at least 30 seconds or more for it to find a route. The UI needs thinner lines, everything feels too cartoonish but that's a minor issue compared to the above."
"I have reported issues here lately and it seems like if the editor does not feel like looking into the matter, they reply with ""Not enough information given"" and close out the report to make it go away. Even though i was detailed in my reporting. Not to mention the extra time i take out of my work day to report the matter. On top of that, waze has been crashing at random."
Just been threatened with report privileged blocked due to me reporting too many times. I might as well go back to Google maps if that is the case. Never had such threats from them. Also navigation seems to be stuck on shortest route. Always trying to take me off the main road to some backstreet. Can't find how to change this navigation setting.
Faulty app. Gives the slowest route to your destination. Don‚Äôt ever trust this app.
"Performance on roads/maps accuracy = fine, no issues, perhaps take into consideration that on small roads also slow drivers drive (with actual speed half of allowed = e.g. 40 km/h instead of 80 km/h); app performance = terrible, sometimes loosing points, also would like to have an option to report road issues from the app - if its there, it's pretty hidden = not very user friendly"
"Used to be great, now it can't keep me locked on the road. It goes from being on the road to next to the road and spins around and back on the road. Makes it impossible to use. Google maps works fine, GPS status apps work and my gps is fine, so it is definitely a recent problem with Waze."
"frequently won't connect to network,. WHY WHY WHY! so, i thought this may just be a flukey Samsung thing, but am beginning to suspect otherwise. I would go through this whole process of shutting off my WiFi, turning my data off then on-and still nothing. Most times i would need to reboot my phone to get it to work. It appears that other reviewers are experiencing a similar thing, so **Waze**, instead of assuming it's just our phones malfunctioning, how about you try to figure it out and fix!"
The app has had some problems recently: -Driving me straight into traffic that is highlighted on the map already. -Fails to load short drives. -When sharing your route the recipient can not live track you through the Waze app. The app used to be good. Hopefully it gets fixed otherwise I will just go back to google maps.
"Really love using this app, but can't anymore it's driving me crazy. I use it with Android Auto, and when my phone goes to sleep so does the map. I've tried looking in settings to keep it a wake or something but I don't want to have to keep changing the settings when I'm in the house and the phone is still awake. Grrr"
"The routes are getting worse everyday. Some of the routes are full of bumpy roads, or are slower than other alternatives. Apart from that, the app gets crazy and starts recalculating the route without reason. This may be a problem if you do not have a good Internet connection..."
"You know what I hate? When I push the go button, and then I have to push the go button again? Instead of pushing the go button multiple time... how about adding a stop button so you can stop navigation without exiting the app. Oh and I like the voices with accents. We need more. No Latino accent voices?"
I like the app because all the features that it has. But the reason am giving it a 3 star is because lately it doesnt let you know where to do a you turn instead it makes you go around the world just to get to the destination. When if i had did the you turn it would've been 2 minutes. Also I notice that it takes you the long way to get to places. I compare it with Google maps. Google maps said 15 minutes and Waze said 25. Something is off with waze. Use to be accurate and faster.
"A good start as an alternative to Google maps, just needs a little work, such as... Calculating departure time insists on using fastest route, not the selected one that avoids a Clean Air Zone. Allowing me to record more vehicle details, such as LIGHT GOODS, not just Private Car. Right/left is sometimes wrong. It refers to some UK roads as 'a', then the number, instead of understanding that A is actually a classification of road. Ex. 'Let's take a 63', instead of saying 'Let's take the A63.'"
"technogically disgusting! Not as it used to be. after over 5 years of heavy use, something happened with waze, the app now CONSTANTLY drops and looks for sattelite connections, its almost unusable. i have to constantly refresh the route just to see where the hell i am. Im baffled over why it has 4.6 stars. back to google maps, SO happy to uninstall."
"I used to use this app all the time to go from Wisconsin to Alabama. I tried to program the address on again on my new phone and it only gives me one route going through all the big cities. When I hit alternate routes it only have me the one that I didn't want and says ""permit Required"" I messaged them on Facebook, but no reply. Even gave them a screen print."
"It is so frustratingly difficult to check how long a trip takes or check tolls for a route if it is not where you are at the moment. If I am at Point A, but I want to see how long it takes for me to get from Point B to Point C, it is so so hard Otherwise, the features are pretty good, but the UX needs a little update"
"Two faulty directions and I'm done with this... Both are known addresses. The first one took me off the road I was on, through a neighborhood in a circle and back out, the same way it sent me in. The second one sent me in an odd direction, but I followed for a minute then stopped to look. It was taking me someplace else. It was crazy. The thing is, there are ten ways to reach either address. I was just looking for the quickest route. Back top Google maps for me..."
"App has been working great on and off. It has really been hit or miss when trying to report hazards on the road or police officers in the area. It works and doesn't work... I use the Ford Sync3 system on a 2019 F-150; hasn't been showing speedometer with the last update, or Google update. Quite frustrating... UPDATE: waze support got back to me. They said all Ford vehicles experiencing this issue, should be fixed in the next update. I'll update my review accordingly"
good app gets me where I want to go its even found quick ways to my destination it would be good if it would give an alternative direction some time but its really good
"I have always used whatever map and traffic app was already installed on my phone, usually Google Maps, and I never really considered trying something new. I wish I could go back and tell myself to download this app a long time ago because it is leaps and bounds ahead of Google Maps. I will only be using this app for all of my mapping needs from now on. I recommend switching asap, you will not regret it. Best map application by far üòÅ!"
This app is great with ETA and Alternate routes when traffic is heavy. The only issues I have are the map editing process and the police alert. Maps I have edited for my work were never approved (the app still want me to go behind a building and through a wall) and police cars are often on the move (not standing still).
"Application behavior has become erratic lately, kept changing the destination ETA while driving. Also it show longer ETA for non-tolled roads compared to tolls road but once we decide to use non-tolled road, sometimes we arrive faster or at the same time as the suggested tolled road. The only reason I use Waze over Google Maps is that I find the routes and next exit on Waze are much clearer."
"Unfortunately Waze has a bunch of UI bugs on my new Android head unit that make it only partially usable. For example the search button in the bottom left doesn't respond at all, so I can't update my destination after initial navigation has started. The music player button also does nothing, nor does the voice recognition."
"Very helpful, clear, responsive. Favors left turns onto multi-lane streets too much, and struggles with the concept of a U-turn. Feature idea: report actual trip time once at destination, calculated from the time you start moving until you stop, in contrast to when the app is opened and closed."
"Why kill such a great app? It's been a year and multiple complaints. The ""My waze"" and and ""where to bar"" still use 1/3 of my 6.75 in screen en portrait position and 1/2 of my screen when used horizontal rendering this app annoying and bothersome to use."
This app has become extremely junky of late. Constantly freezing. Requires regular restarting.
"I had to remove this app. Your update is so cluttered. It used to be enter address, go. Now I've got pop ups and a new screen and more things to click before I can start. very disappointing. the directions have been really off as a result. this app used to be perfect. now its awful."
"Great map app. Amazing alternative to the nearly useless Google Maps; it has all the roads, shows current speed limit, and has options to change priority between road types, so you won't find yourself on the interstate highway when trying to walk to the neighbor's house like Maps. Only reason I'm not rating 5 stars is that I wish the location search was a bit better at understanding where I want to go, but then I can just use google to search for a place and use this to get there, so still great"
"It looses the route. When this happens, the app is unable to get back the control over the route. Just calculating, calculating and it says it unable to find a route - driving on a motorway.The app is not reliable, at all. It looks clearly, the Google wants to kill this app to take its Google Maps into a better position. Eradicating the competitors..."
"Good app but 2 problems: 1. Its UI is a bit too simple and big. Icons' size could be a little smaller. 2. You can set routs only from your location. Maybe, I want to see how I can go to my destination from somewhere other than my location, Like in Google maps. You can get good ideas from Google maps and MAPS.ME, thanks"
