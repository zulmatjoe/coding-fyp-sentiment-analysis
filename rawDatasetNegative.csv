"Changed from 3 to 1 star. I spend a lot of time developing a video, (via the app) to use a certain audio, and it refuses to post, even with perfect internet. I can't make a reel that is 5+ seconds long without having this issue. I have to resort to screen recording the audio playing, then importing it into capcut and then, making my video, otherwise if I do this thru Instagram, it won't work.",1
They will just simply focus on the reels section instead of making Instagram better . So many glitches üëé,1
‚ò£Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏èHONEST‚ö†Ô∏è‚ò£Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è: this app is the most horrible experience I've had! I tried signing up . But it automatically said my account violated their policy?!üëøüëøüò†üò§,1
Not work proprly...All apps are going so well but instagrm has many internt issues...now i install thz app 4th time in a day...üòëüòëüòë,1
Edits on photos are warping and the app keeps crashing all of a sudden,1
"I hate the new update that makes stuff be on your fyp, it put a bunch of pictures of the ""cottagecore aesthetic"" and it wont met me make it go away, i uate that aethetic and i domt want to see it on my oage and i cant get rid of it.",1
"A buggy mess. As others have reported, your new ""tiktok"" style way of viewing posts hides the comments and likes buttons as the bottom navigation bar does not retract. Videos constantly freeze and it's not my connection, it's bugs in the app. Half the time when tapping a video to unmute it doesn't work. Sometimes turning the volume up automatically unmutes. Other times it doesn't. Honestly, I don't get how these things passed testing prior to release!",1
Quality going down. Few days ago my iphone 13 didn't have soon he in it's video in Facebook. Now I cannot login to my Instagram account using Samsung tablet. Meta is going downhill.,1
I don't know my intagram is not working i cant see my following list it is fully blank and i also cant see comments even i log out my account refresh my wifi but still the problem is same,1
"[Edit] Why is the search in chat feature suddenly gone?? What's been going through your minds? You add features that are useful and then you remove them. It's ridiculous, not to mention the large amount of bugs you still allow to continue, messages not coming through until at times hours later, being anti-actual artist, and you allow hate towards marginalized communities. So sad, the app has so much potential but the creators abuse it.",1
Posts not appearing in hashtags. Caption not working. Frequently app getting crash. Reported this issue but still not solved.,1
Please Instagram I think reels should remain as reels but not as you have been update this often..I suggest feed should remain as feed even if a person wants to post a video it doesn't need to be a reel..reels should remains as reel and feed should be feed even if it is a video..,1
"BUGS!, BUGS!!, BUGS!!! I don't even know where to start! Reels always freeze while their audio keeps playing. Sometimes the like button doesn't turn red when clicked (especially for reels & comments). The app always refreshes multiple times on startup. And for some weird reason, Instagram removed the cool feature that enables one know at a glance if a comment is liked by the post's owner. Now you're just playing with the UI in the updates and aren't actually reviewing the app's functionality.",1
"Needs the option to auto block private accounts and to autohide post with ""more than enough"" likes.",1
Not being able to access my account because of a code error and all my work is pending. Instagram wrongly judged a picture,1
Instagram is the worst platform ever. They want to suppress the voice of Hindus and is highly baised. Worst platform!!!,1
"I have set up an account for my business and without reels, a business is close to pointless on Instagram. Given that, one should have access to all the songs on Instagram's music library. Sadly, the search option for songs isn't working for me at all. Have been raising this with IG for weeks now, but the bug persists. Can't choose song of my choice at all",1
Why the heck you continously showing your ad in between of all the app I'm using in ? Do you want to Uninstall the app ?,1
"The increasing focus on reels is awful. People know Instagram as an app for photos and art, that's what they're coming here for. The reels don't do anyone good and will just be making people leave for other apps. You're not even able to pause, restart or fast forward reels, which is ridiculous. Edit: Full screen feed? Really!?",1
"For the past 2 months everytime I try and turn on Instagram it shows the logo and then a blank white screen. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it, I've restarted my phone and I've even tried downloading prior versions with no success. I've sent complaints about it 2 times and not got any response back. I'm not going to format my phone because Instagram's the only app that's not working on it. Meta has terrible consumer care and it really shows. Why advertise business pages if you crash this often",1
Connecting Instagram business pages to Facebook business pages is far more complicated than it needs to be and far less consistent than it needs to be.,1
Useless and disappointing. Not safe. Lacks everything that is necessary. All the developers are Stupid and greedy.,1
"Wish I could give this app 0 stars. I guess ""Meta"" facebook was such a failure Mark Suckborg has to flood this app with ads to try and make some money. He should probably follow in Elon's footsteps and fire everyone and start over.",1
Constantly changing how things show up but somehow not having the foresight to know it will make things illegible or blocked. C'mon now.,1
"Why the f there isn't any customer service for the problems we have , there is only one useless site that dont so anything , i just lost access to my 5 year account and i cant login anymore ,please do smth , there are roo many memories in that account.",1
Hi Instagram! Please I can't login my account my username name and password is correct but I'm unable to login I guess the problem is from the app kindly please rectify the problem ASAP.,1
Soo many bugs are there message sent and received when sent message it too many time taken kindly resolve the bug I give one star,1
This is a great app. But one day when I tried to take a picture the filters won't load. And I tried restarting it many times but it's still loading. And whenever I try to text my friend my message won't send. It is very annoying and I tried to delete it. Now I downloaded it back but it's still the same. And I went to make a new account and it kept on loading. Then I pressed continue with Facebook and it's still loading. Please fix this. It's getting annoying.,1
I dislike the new update... The way the screen looks when looking at a post feels like I'm watching a story and it feels awkward to scroll.. Also when I going into a post that was shared to me by a friend it shows a completely different post.. Specifically a reel. This has been happening for a while and it is quite frustrating because I cannot look at things that have been sent to me.,1
"Reel always stuck when I want to upload them, the algorithm suckes, With 30k followers I only reach 500 of my followers now! Awefull app.",1
"I keep getting ""an unexpected error occured please try again later"" even after updating the app",1
"every single day this app has problems. videos in messages won't send, stories won't load and then it's impossible to switch between accounts because you can't do it while something is loading. even if I delete the message or story it still won't let me switch between account. every day I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it to get it to work again.",1
"I spent nearly half an hour trying to film a reel and edit the text on it, and just as I pressed the next button it crashed and returned me back to the sound screen? tf and when I went back to re-edit the text the video bar was partially black and I couldn't see the clips I took, while the fonts didn't work :/ edit, 26/12/21: surprise! reels still suck. I'm trying to film a reel for half an hour, till instagram decided to crash and throw me out: the app closed by itself and my video was lost üëç",1
I have been trying to email their email support regarding my issue but nobody has gotten back to me yet. It's been almost 2 weeks. My app stopped working the last time I updated it. Now it will no longer open. I will only just get a white screen when I try to open the app and I've already tried all the bacis troubleshooting I could think of. This is getting frustrating!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
I don't know but why my Instagram is not showing all the latest features for reels even I update it.,1
I have a facing problem in Instagram... I have not able to calling video call to any of my friend in Instagram... Why???,1
"I can't control messages, anyone can message me and even after changing settings, am still receiving messages",1
Too much glitch in this app .... i can't even msg anyone Please fix this problem asap,1
"This is a really bad app, even after writing all the correct usernames, I am not able to login.",1
"Instagram has the worst connectivity. During solid 4G+ network access and functionality, the app continually fails to get messages across. The incoming messages are coming through but the app wouldn't send mine through and the app wouldn't refresh at all. A complete disasterclass for a social media app, especially for the purpose of direct messaging.",1
"Since the new update, the app has become very annoying. It won't let me post any stories, report any bugs or do anything in general. I tried restarting my phone, clearing the app's data, re-installing it, but nothing has changed. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. Edit: something I forgot to add, my feed is now full of recommendations and ads only, nothing is personalized. Whenever I request to not be shown a certain kind of posts, there's a whole bunch of them coming up next.",1
"From 2hrs i am having a problem while logging in . It is asking for phone number ,i gave my phone number then it is sending the confirmation code but i am not able to recive any code ... Pls solve my problem",1
"Used to be good. Now it's damn near a waste of my precious ticking time. I'm following nearly 1,000 people but always see posts from the same 30-40, mixed in with ""related"" posts I don't want to see. Why am I ""following"" people if I'm never gonna see their stuff in my ""feed""? Bish, please.",1
I'm getting a blank screen when try to log in to Instagram. It's ok with Instagram lite but the main application won't work. You didn't care at all about this problem and do nothing to solve it. It's make me to remove it for ever.,1
This app is crash after using 1-2 hours. Please fix this.,1
I added caption in reels but reels posted without caption and when I report my problem at Instagram it's not reporting and not resolve. Can anyone tell me how I fix this problem??,1
this app is just. no. your post literally won't get anywhere only some garbage posts will and it's just not worth it. stuff like voice chats are so laggy. group chats are so laggy. why did you make these an option in the app if they're literally unusable from lag? also it just repeatedly crashes and doesn't show my posts on hashtags.,1
Hey this update is very bad where we can't save reels from our story to our phone üò∂ it's really a bad update,1
My instagram is updated but it still doesn't seem to have the new updates like react with emoji etc.. please fix it,1
I can't able to open the reels whenever I try to open the reels because of some error issues please work on that error plss,1
"It's not good at all, no i can't see how many people liked my post, even on reels I can't se the total number of likes",1
When I update the app it give many bugs when I upload story it automatically uploaded twice worst experience,1
"Been having problems with the video call feature lately. The camera glitches, blinks, and goes black screen whenever I try to use filters in call. But when I go to post a story, the filters work smoothly. However, when I go to my other phone, the camera does not glitch in call. I tried to reinstall several times reboot my phone, and clear data. Still, nothing happens. I used to love ig video calls because of the filters, but I can't use it anymore on my other phone. Please address this is",1
Worst experience from a week app is not working properly don't know what kind of bug is there,1
I have never get updated version of this app . I have updated it so many times but it's still the same old version,1
My Instagram id :- aniketsuthar009.......i don't know why but very high bugs in my id like i am not able to react to msg and also not reply to message and not able to on theme of any chat and i report this bug but instagram not seen my report yet....... Please instagram check my account!,1
Super glitchy since switching to Samsung S22. Worked just fine on Google Pixel 4a.,1
Your application is not working properly don't know why it's always showing loading on my news feed,1
I upgraded this app two days ago. Now I can't view other people's stories. I'm annoyed.,1
My Instagram is not getting updated automatically..i am unable to find feature to make collaboration,1
"Hi, I have faced issues with Instagram if i follow any peoples so following numbers not showing increase or decrease following numbers are stuck",1
"Music sticker is there but it won't play the song, it's pointless, don't know why but if it doesn't work in some country/device or due to any constraint ,then why on earth they're including in the app. Atleast hide this feature for the devices/region which doesn't support. User search and put it there with giving time in editing and finally it doesn't work. Greatü§¶",1
"I've been enjoying Instagram until this latest update. The UI is even more stressful than that of the previous versions. Why exactly do you have to overlay the engagement icons and captions on the posts. It makes it difficult to read some texts on the post. The app crashes when I want to view insights. It was working perfectly on the previous versions. Please go back to the previous update, I don't see anything wrong with it.",1
Not a good app. It closes automatically whenever I click on any video,1
Very badass app I'm no found Bollywood songs for stories only English songs here,1
"No doubt it is a good app, but still the data consumption is unsatisfactory. This app consumes a huge amount of data in a very short interval of time. Even if we put a story or watch 3-4 reels or videos , it uses more than 100 MB. I used Instagram just for 20 minutes and it consumed my 200MB. I request you to have a look on this issue...üòûüòû",1
It worked all fine and yesterday my account just got disabled without a notice even when I didn't violate the Instagram rules... N now my account isn't getting recovered back again,1
My Instagram account is suspended for no reason...i have not violated any of the community guideline provided by Instagram..so i request to Instagram team to kindly look into this matter and reactivate my account as early as possible üôè,1
I think instagram not work properly plzzz check some bug is there coz am putting my story nd add the song the name is not search so plzzzz fix the issue quickly thanku....‚ù§,1
"Very bad experience, having troubling in login, troubling in messaging, having troubling in seeing post and reels of friends",1
"Instagram is high or what? I get the notifications of messages I've already seen, and there is a serious issue, sometimes when we are chatting with someone, even though the person has sent many messages, it shows that the person is typing, and we have to reopen insta to fix this, PLEASE FIX THIS INSTAGRAM. and also I am not able to use the filters.",1
"This app is doing discrimination with its users by providing some users various options (i.e swipe left replied to option, various emojis etc )while not to other users. # Boycott Instagram",1
"After 2 weeks of use it turned into ""suggested post"" only. No content from people i actually follow whatsoever. No wonder meta is going down the toilet. Unisntalled.",1
Too many bugs my dms sometimes load after 24 hours ive reported this issue several times but nothing happened please resolve this issue,1
I am not happy with this update. Please resolve the all the gliches I can't see notes in Instagram please solve the problem,1
This app waste your time. There is not good content in reels. People make cringe reels and instgram virals them,1
"I am ok with most of the changes. Except these ones. These ones have literally been ruining my full experience. My feed no longer includes posts I've previously seen and has people I don't follow. The other problem is when is scrolling through the explore page, It clicks into a position. Its extremely uncomfortable and frustrating. I try to move it, but it just clicks back. I am hating these new features.",1
"AND THIS YEAR BUGS AWARDS APP GOES TO INSTAGRAM, SO many bugs that you love it soo much that you may no longer able to use it, and Team DEV gonna provide an ultimate BUGS that performs realtime crash features.",1
The old versions are much better than new update. In updated app version I'm unable to upload reel more than 15 seconds on my story. This disappoint me I axpect that I'm the app get as it was in the past.,1
"recently ad pages automatically pops up even when I'm not using Instagram at all and I'm on other unrelevent apps. It is really on my nerves and I don't know how to fix it. I uninstall and install the app multiple times but it didn't work out. I think the only way is removing my account and make a new one but I'm not sure it'll fix it. Instagram help centre is the worst and unresponsive. They're useless. I send them my problem in terms of emails, issue reports, feedbacks but nothing.",1
"So many glitches , didn't able to use effect sometime in story.... Worst app please delete such app from play store üö´üò§",1
"hi ur app was very great, but I think story Time was very short plz update. need to be longer",1
The app is not working properly I mean to say it's lagging alot i think there may b some bug my internet connection is awesome plz do check,1
The new update is awful. No one wants tiktok 2.0. The size of the photos and the lack of being able to scroll through your feed without going 1 at a time. I really don't think I'll have insta for much longer. I hope they actually take people's feedback and switch back to the older/much better version.,1
"Why on earth would you break essential functionality such as making a basic post? Trying to edit resulted in a glitch where a filter was added randomly and which was impossible to remove. When I finally got the editing to work fine enough and posted the photos, the images had been warped?? If Meta wants to make a worse version of Tiktok then go ahead, but don't break the core functionality that made the app famous. As a former software engineer I really feel bad for the app team.",1
The Most Buggiest Bug I have ever found in Instagram is that We cant save any reel or anything from insta this is very very very Bad ... plz work upon it üòêüò´üò´üò´,1
"Ever since I started using Instagram I never picked up the app for more than a three minutes without running into a bug, but at least those were bugs that one can live with. Now whenever I open the app nothing loads, chats, stories, posts, reels, Nothing. And my internet is perfect, every other app on my phone works great. The only way that I'm able to use the app is if I redownload it, but once the phone turns off it stops working. Really expected more from such a big and rich company.",1
Instagram would be so much better if it stops lacking so much. It goes blank out of nowhere and then it clears everything i was watching. And one more problem is that i can't seperate the reels and keep in different collections. I need a feature where you type the date when you saved the reel and the reels show up from that date or day. I hope next update isn't disappointing!!,1
Update version is worst...i can't have slide reply option and also I can't give emoji reaction on msg..why..this happened,1
"I just installed this app,l am having problem in logging, it's only says wait a few minutes before you try again ,help me to log in",1
"Full of unrelated ads and celebrity. Do not allow user that only wanna read news but keep posting all Bitcoin, blind invitation, nuisance posting and spam commercial. Hopeless. Waited for disabled long long time. Pro USA system. Asia should avoid esp non pro USA countries.",1
In past I'm happy with using this app. But nowhere sudden an issue appear. Previously Reel option is not working as good. When I tried to upload any video. Every time video uploaded without captions and description. I tried many times to write captions. Even I tried to correct this problem by reinstall the app. But now this time reel option disappeared from my account. I don't know what I do. Very disappointed.,1
"Down loaded the app ,but it does not work ,it just says system ,manage failure.",1
so disappointed. Why my ig account suddenly can't login on 2 device ? If I logged in to my phone then my ig acc on ipad will automatically logged out.,1
"Terrible glitchy app, stays loading even with great Wi-Fi, it's really not that hard",1
Many times i reported that i have problems and not show the replay and venish mood but you not saw this issue.... I told many friends to rate 1 and mention this,1
"As of lately the app seems to be malfunctioning. This app is full of bugs.!!! Sometimes it's not working at all ! If can't handle the app stop running it!! Sharing anything goes into processing for ages, it's time for another alternative of this app, the app is crashing, I'm just gonna close the account don't see any growth!!!",1
Got worse after Facebook. And when you post something on your feed it looks different compare to when u publish it.,1
"I hate my experience with Instagram now ! Because once try to put my new email on my Instagram just because i lost my sim and email information they decided to lock my account requesting for confirmation how you want me to get the confirmation code when i don't have my email and when you try to put two factor using your new phone to Longin they also lock the account I'm so confused, just I'm imagin i got hack a week ago i choose to change email they lock the account because I'm a new device",1
Many bugs glitch in the app plz fix it someone watchy story and it's not showing and many more plz fix humble request to you,1
"Ever since I've updated instagram two days ago, it hasn't been working at all. Every time I open it, it just closes down. I've tried everything to make it work, uninstalling it and installing it repeatedly. But no positive results appeared. It seems that there might've been a bug in the latest update because instagram was functioning just fine before that. Judging from the other reviews, this problem is getting quite common. Please fix this bug asap. I'll give this app a higher rating after.",1
i have to say the reporting system is useless and i get restricted for no reason at all.i could go on a list but for what you guys dont listen.(update)forcing reels on us now?,1
"Very bad , I can't get any new posts and new reels from past few days I hope you will solve this problem",1
worst app im this whole world that exhausted trend videos was literally disgusting. and plz the solve the problem of that unwanted reels . it create bad impact on child.,1
"If I wanted to use tik tok, I'd be using til tok. The May update is aweful. It's like being stuck in the reels format. The scrolling motion is jarring and it's full of ads. The page is washed out by background colours, not like the sleek presentation of previous format. The most ill considered element is the text description of an image geting overlaid on top of the image, making it impossible to read. Your developers are out of touch with the experience of users and content creators.",1
"Don't give the notification as chat message, when someone only liked your message . This needs to be change",1
Its not working well. Even it automatically turn off when try to open this.,1
"For an app that's competing with Tiktok, it's not doing a great job. Adding and editing reels is glitchy at best and rarely uploads the same version as the one it's just previewed literally seconds earlier. Reels don't play, audio doesn't play. If you attempt to look at your insights for anything other than the last 30 days, the app shuts down. Anyone using Instagram Reels for business, I suggest you find alternative means of promoting yourself.",1
"Seriously I like the app but the problem is I can't find the filters, how I use the filter and where I can find the filter",1
Everyone please read this!! Social Media is keeping u busy on app so you can't focus in life. Escape the Matrix.,1
After the last updates Instagram has been so bad nothing is working the main page is black my followers and following counters are not showing up,1
"Dear Team, What is up with instagram lately? Reels are having bugs... I can't watch reels from 1st and 2nd row... Whenever I open any reel from above rows it is showing 1st video from 3rd rowüòÇ please fix this bug",1
"I have been using Instagram for several years now. It's an amazing app but from past few days it's not working. I tried reinstalling the app again and again but still the problem is same ""couldn't refresh feed, black screen, buffering"". It's frustrating now. I have two accounts, one personal another business both of them are in still state. what am I supposed to do now? I raised my concern to the team but the issue hasn't been resolved yet. please fix this. Thanks",1
It was working good but after the latest update i can't sign up or log in.Pease fix it.,1
"Since over a month now, I have been unable to use Instagram on my phone, I have uninstalled and installed it several times and it shows me nothing but a black screen. I would like this to be fixed please.",1
"Optimisation for this app sucks. I have been sitting here for 2 hours waiting for a single video to send to a group DM, and it hasn't sent at all. I can't switch accounts, or reset the app, or log out, or force stop the app at all. Can't do anything until it sends, which - knowing how ''GOOD'' Instagram is - is going to be a slug to put up with. Glad to spend an indefinite amount of time with slow connection, thank you so much Instagram :)",1
I loathe being forced suggested posts and that I have to dismiss them every 30 days. Make a separate stream for those. I only care about the pages I follow,1
After the Latest update the application is crashing again and again . Tried to install application once again but issue is still not resolved.,1
"i can't login into any of my accounts everytime I try to login it says ""error sorry we couldn't complete your request please try again in a moment"" please fix this bug my Instagram hasn't been working properly since yesterday",1
Social media such an incomplete drag. Never show anything from my friends just whatever it is the app wants to shove down my throat. With that being said I was just as well go watch a few minutes of tiktok,1
"I have an issue with insta , i have downloaded insta, but i could not reply. On massenger, and many times I share my problem, but here no solution my problem,, i also many times update insta, but no change... So I don't like insta...üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†",1
A worst app it banned my account [__saurav_kumar___]. I logged in my id with Facebook but after ban it wants password that I don`t know because I previously logged in using Facebook. After putting some details it says please login using your email and after clicking on that option it says account not found. Thanks...,1
Dm is glitching ever time i got msg id get notifications for unless after 7 hour and there more right now if i send reels to anyone i got error masg cant send and the reels just disappear i did deleted this app will try to find something work probably,1
I've been reporting a bug where I cannot see my notes for almost 2 weeks now nothing is being done,1
"I can't even!! It's really getting worse with each update! I don't know why, but every once in a while Instagram will glitch and make my phone restart on it's own. It doesn't happen with any other app. It also sometimes turn my theme light even when I've got dark theme on. This is getting very annoying. I've already reinstalled the app a lot of times last month but this still keeps happening. Also, please make the music option available in Bangladesh.",1
Making psychological ads in YouTube and other platforms thata not attractive that's psychological like MAKING SOMEONE MENTALLY FORCE WITH OCD (EX):FATY GIRL DANCE WITH NO FUN MUSIC AND UTS not DANCE BUT VIEWERS 5think OH I CAN ALSO GET POPULARITY WITH THIS TYPE OF DISGUSTED SHORT VIDEOS dont use Instagram report all ads,1
"I'd give it a zero star if it were possible, I have tried opening the app constantly & it's constantly an empty screen! I've uninstalled the app & reinstalled it numerous times in hopes it would fix the issue, I've even downloaded the update & still nothing, just the same blank screen, can't refresh it, can't do anything. It's not like I haven't got space or storage on my phone so this is clearly an Instagram issue. I'm really not pleased that I potentially could lose all my stuff on there!!!",1
My experience with Instagram has been very depressing for the last 5 years or so.,1
When I was in the US and I got the reels update then when I left a month later it went back to the original insta before it. When will the users outside of the US get the Full version of the Reels update. It's very inconvenient because parts of the videos that users post we can't even see. Same thing with music it's not even available in the Caribbean and we just have to watch stories without the full experience,1
"Okay so this problem is with most of the people using ig. I'm not able to use if properly. Whenever I open the app it says ""couldn't refresh feed"". Ig is not even responding to any of my messages. It's became worse. The reels I don't like it. The buttons are all changed they are not in their places and I can't even check the posts of anyone. I tried uninstalling but even after uninstalling the app, it says the same thing. Please fix this bug. Ig has such a bad update!!!!",1
"Hello Instagram. I've been using Instagram since 2016. But a week ago, i posted some videos on my ig feed for college tasks. It was successfully uploaded although there are errors before it was uploaded. And this morning, i check my ig feed and one of my videos is lost. I never deleted it because it's my college task. I never archived it either. I check 'Deleted Post' in setting and there's no my lost video. This is really annoying. Hope it'll be fixed asap. Thank you.",1
"Up until last week I've had no problems with the app. But then one day I went onto my account and it kept saying ""couldn't refresh feed"". My account has not been deactivated as other people can still see my profile. But I can't post anything, or see any posts and I can't send or receive messages either. I've tried reaching out to fix the problem but no one seems to care. Highly annoyed by this as my account hold so many pictures that are really special. I hope the developers can sort this ASAP.",1
"It used to work great but now I was trying to upload a reel and it crashed, so I shut my phone off to see if it would reset it but it didnt, the program still thought it was uploading the reel. So I deleted the program and reinstalled it now my account doesnt even have reel's or the shopping. Facebook you guys are really underperforming with this app trying to change into a TikTok snapchat, quit trying to keep up with the jones's. It was fantastic as a photoapp, even small videos with music.",1
"There are so many issues that I'm facing in this app. First of all, I can't see the messages that my friends are sending. When I send a message, my message is sent more than once. I can't do a video call or a voice call. When I'm going through stories, the app freezes, I have to restart my device and then open the app. Lastly, nowadays it's not even letting me open the the app. IT SAYS, ""INSTAGRAM HAS STOPPED WORKING."" It opens for one second and then closes. Ima delete the app.",1
"Slow performance. Since the newest version has been released, the app takes too much time to load stories and videos. And sometimes it just doesn't. At first i thought it is because of my network connection, but even after changing network plans to better performance, the app stays the same. I'm kinda getting away from this app due to this.",1
"Full of ads now! 1 ad for every 3 posts. Its so annoying. Same for the stories. It makes you not want to use the app at all. On the home page, i just want to see the content for people and pages ive followed. I dont want to see suggested posts here. You were better off keeping it separate with suggested posts in the explore tab where people can go if they WANT to see new content to follow instead of forcing ads and pages on them. Edit: Nov 17th. New buttons are the last straw. Deleting app",1
I can't have any updates for example : I can react to messages I can't reply to messages I can't post people's story's and they can't either I don't have the messenger symbole but the old one,1
"I still don't have the music feature that everyone else has since last year, what is with that? I have tried logging out and unstalling the app and then re-installing it, but still nothing. I have the latest updates so I know its not that. I have also contacted you twice regarding this but nothing has been fixed. Super annoyed.",1
"I really LOVE Instagram but a few days ago I noticed that the option to edit the highlights cover is gone and it makes my Instagram completely messed up. I thought it was a problem with the Internet connection or even with my operating system but I saw that the problem is with Instagram. Make that option come back, everyone is complaining about it! Do something!",1
"I have denied the App permission to my contacts, so how does the app still have have access to my contacts?",1
"I uninstalled the app in August and accessed my account a few times through a browser and my account got blocked. All of it is blank and the error ""couldn't refresh feed"" appears every time. I contacted the support several times already but I'm not even sure the reports were properly registered. I basically have my account ""blocked"" and can't do anything about it.",1
"The latest update is a disaster. Not only has everything moved around, but now it highlights videos and shopping instead of photos. It's not a social media platform anymore, it's an advertisement platform. And give us the ability to see the dash in chronological order. I miss a lot thanks to that.",1
Going backwards. Instagram had been really running the social media experience. The app is adding more and more (unwanted) features that are glitchy and have a lot of bugs. They do not listen to the users and do not take the user experience in consideration. I am afraid that time of Instagram is coming to the end just like Facebook did.,1
You have add options for story edit option and post edit option after posting. When some mistakes in story we needs to delete entire story & and again need to it. So please add this options & make some changes.,1
There are so many glitches and it is problem to react to messages So remove that glitches... When someone sent a message it's problem on reacting by using emojis,1
This is some bs. Instagram I've been tryna downsize my follower and following lost and for three days now its telling me that I can't share I can't like and I can't post captions with a safety for Instagram thing popping up. Please fix it,1
"Had my instagram account linked to my Facebook. One day randomly Instagram disabled and terminated both my insta and fb accounts. No reason given, no one to contact about.",1
I am having problem in loading it. This is the second time. I tried switching off my mobile and then trying to load the Instagram but it didn't work. Please try to fix the problem,1
"Not able to reply to a particular message. Kindly fix the bug or vulnerability. Don't give updates simply,,",1
Instagram will go down as the company that ruined photos. Why cant u post photos of different sizes. Cropping photos is awful and its ruining photography. Suggested feeds and hiding older posts is terrible. U suck Instagram.,1
"Bad experience very bad experience, I can't use this app properly, I can't save reels from this app, and this app keeps crashing.",1
This app is full of bugs and you guys haven't even given me new features of Instagram and I have also reported many times but I did not get any reply from your side.,1
"Used to be great. Now when I video call, there's a constant echo throughout the entire call. Please fix this. The new update ruined everything",1
It shows that my friend's account has been disabled when it hasn't and so I can't message her + it never shows newly sent messages from anyone,1
I don't know why instagram suspend any account without any reason it is just not ok...don't add filters nd all try to solve ur glitches first there is a lot of issue nd id suspend problem but no one is fixing it...don't recommend this app,1
Ther are so many bugs glitches and whenever I want to send something from my gallery there are albums the don't show up it's there but when I want to swipe down to reach it I can't,1
I have reported bug several times but you people are responding from weeks I can't share any reels posts to anyone it's not delivered only very bad service and I'm having issue with customer who all are on insta and your application is not working üò§,1
What's the issue with stories? Every time I go on them and click the next storie it starts going through them really fast. Fix this Instagram.,1
"Instagram literally allows people to sell themselves like virtual hookers. This app is by far the most useless tasteless, trashy, immoral type of social media.. I find it to be a genuine waste of time.. I guess small minds are statisfied with small ideas....",1
Very bad experience i forget my acc password but they didnt send any login link and any msg. I try from last two weeks but they didnt respone and can't rrply me on my mail i send it. Kindly Contact with mee they didn't respond help me to recover my ac,1
"Ever since the last update, the cards in chat have a big gap from the left. I've reported the bug twice on Instagram but not yet resolved.",1
"I had someone hack my account, and I wasn't able to receive any help from Instagram, it's a good app, but it is just to unstable to use safely",1
I am not receiving the code for verification on my number. and without I am not able to use my account even if I am having my login credientails. I can only login into my account but the app is denying me to use Instagram without phone number verification. Please either send me the verification code or I will lose my account,1
"The app keeps glitching, I cannot click on profile links, jump stories, I try already install and install again and nothing works!",1
whats happening broo instas not working for me i thought it was down but it turned out ot be mee. whn i open insta all i seee is a black screen no post loadin screen. Can i know why.. it definitely not my wifi or data cause insta on pc is working fine but phone isnt...,1
Not able to open the after recent update using Wifi. It works fine with mobile data. Horrible,1
The new updates keeps getting worse and worse! It doesn't make using it easier at all and Instagram rarely to never listens to the consumers complaints!,1
"My insta is not showing any of my friends, it's not even refreshing properly need ur help pls do check after my insta problem & it is consuming a bit lot of time to show it's new feed.",1
"Worst update of this app is the current version of update, it shows fake activity status, when people are not online it shows them active. Moreover this app automaticalky unsend msgs",1
Better to categories it as advertising app Every third post and story is ads here .. Searching for other apps to switch,1
"This application used to work very well at first, but now even without using it for a day, when you open it it will pop up a massage saying I have violated the rules bla bla and then block me for taking any action, it's kinda boring now ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1
"Started off as a good idea to keep up with people online, but at this point in time, I can't even see the posts of ppl I follow because my feed is flooded with recommended tiktoks.",1
I have been suspended for no reason. I disagreed with the decision and provided a photo too. Nothing has happened yet. The platform is full of bots and they don't get suspended and yet somehow I was and for no clear reason. Unsuspend me.,1
Becoming a worst app...now in it posts are automatically deleting..whats wrong with it..now Instagram is no more a safe app,1
"It crashes all the time, will show that there are new messages when there aren't and the only way to make them disappear is to delete the conversation, the stories are part way down the screen so the bottom gets cut off, the pictures in posts shake violently when you scroll... I am not the only one with these issues and they have been going on for months.",1
"The latest update is a huge step backwards and was completely unnecessary. Features like Shop and Reels will not be used and removing the 'save draft' feature is a real inconvenience, which will probably result in the app being used less. It feels like Instagram's target market has shifted predominantly to teenagers, which, considering the social media platforms offering similar features to those introduced are already plentiful, is a mistake and the previous app version should be reinstated.",1
"Haven't been able to use it at all. Only things it does is to open a white screen and tell me it can't refresh the feed. I only downloaded the app as it was needed to confirm information, as requested when using the web app. It's a loop, and there is no one to contact about it. Unbelievable, I spent hours trying to fix it and it apparently requires downloading an old version, which I won't be doing.",1
"The most primitive and dumb app I've ever used. It just makes me wonder how can such a popular app be so poorly built. I mean Facebook App is definitely much better than this. My issues: 1. The pics always somehow rotate by 90¬∞ and there's no way to fix it. I end up not uploading any pics. 2. I can not tag people cause as soon as I remove my keyboard on the screen to select a person from the suggestions, the whole list vanishes as well. And I can not see the list when using the keyboard.TBC..",1
"Can't log into my account, that's very annoying. This new update is disappointing version",1
"I don't think I can properly put into words how much I despise this app since its last major update. I genuinely *HATE* it. Replacing the notifications with a 'shop' button is such a disgustingly grifter decision. Placing the post and notifications at the top of the screen makes what you're in the app to do even harder. An improvement would have been to move messages down to post and notifications, and put 'shop' at the top somewhere. This update makes me just want to trash the app.",1
"This new update is horrible. All my drafts no longer exist. I was trying to post a photo and it led to the forever pending bar with no way of cancelling it even if you went onto airplane mode. I restarted the app, restarted my phone and nothing. I had to uninstall the app to be able to post a photo again. I was able to make drafts again but then I went back to see if I can access the drafts and there is no way of getting to it. I miss the old way. It was much better with its chronological order posts and an organic feed. There is no fluidity especially for a photo posting app. I don't need to see posts from 4 days ago. I also don't need to shop on Instagram. The sponsored ads every 3 posts already tried that.",1
"Instagram has a lot of bug errors that never seem to get fixed. Here's an example, yesterday & today. I was trying to add friends to my post. But I was not able too, because it kept saying that my edits were not saved, and that I should try again later. Well, what's the point of having a tagging system that is clearly full of restrictions! I have no choice but to give Instagram, a generous one star.",1
"Having troubles singing into my business account. Changed my email in the settings, then it asks to verify the email with a 6 digit security code sent to that email. Nothing was sent. Tried again, asked them to resend it. Nothing. Now my account is on idle because of a bug. I hope it's just a bug. Bugs can be fixed. Otherwise... I'm pulling my hair out right now lol help me Instagram!!!",1
"I've had a major issue lately... None of the videos are loading on one of my accounts and I've tried everything to fix it. The sponsored videos work, but the others posted by accounts don't. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and that worked for a bit, but then they stopped loading again. I've cleared cache, updated my phone, restarted my phone multiple times, changed the settings and logged in and out of my account multiple times. I'm honesty sick of it. No wonder it's rating is only a 3.8.",1
The new update is super annoying. I don't like how it frames each post on top and the post below just keeps on playing the audio. I wonder what your tech department is on! Like seriously! Do we really needed that?! Enough with the constant need to add on stupid features just because you want to make a record of it! Keep it sophisticated! Jesus!,1
Am so fed up with this app. Yesterday I made around 6-9 reel videos. And I saved all of them. When in evening I went on the drafts side where reels get saved I could only find 2 videos. Even I saved all my videos. It took lot of efforts and hard work. And what I get nothing. Like seriously. Please help me to get them all back. üôèüèªüôèüèª I really want them back,1
"How in the world does my video won't work for this app? It keeps on saying 'We could not process this video.' It keeps me on going around and around trying to figure out how to fix the issue. On top of that, some photos are not even uploading properly. This app is suppose to be used for sharing photos and videos yet the app can't properly do its job. *Sigh*",1
"Honestly, the app isn't bad, but the help menu is completely impossible to navigate, and when you try to delete an account made with Facebook, it is unable to be deleted, because it adds more characters after your password, stopping you from doing so. These two issues make getting back into an account and deleting an account an absolute pain. Personal recommendation: unless you have a very good reason to use this app, don't bother trying to restore your account . You won't get anywhere.",1
"It's been a year since I've been facing the problem of cropped stories because my phone's screen isn't the usual 16:9 ratio. Also when I try to put up any 4k videos in stories, the app just hangs up. Not a problem of processing power here because I have the Oneplus 6 with 8gb ram which is more than sufficient. Being such a big platform such as Instagram, one year is more than enough time to fix such minor issues, specially with so many phones in the market now with 19:9 ratio screens.",1
"I used to like instagram like everyone else, but however since the very beginning of august, i can't upload any videos on my stories, and whenever I tried to watch any videos it got stuck (wether the audio played just fine, but the video is on pause, and vice versa). Does it has anything to do with my phone, or is it because of bugs? I tried uninstall and re-install it, still doesn't work.",1
Too many adverts. It's more of a shopping app than a social media site these days. The new layout is pointless. If we wanted a reels page we would use tiktok. The explore page has been shifted out of the way - possibly the most used part of the app. It's hard to navigate and crashes regularly but I never have a problem with any other apps.,1
"The app has been having a lot of glitches lately. It keeps refusing to refresh my feed until after continous effort instead of just one tap or drag as it was previously. Keeps saying that its not responding, like 10 or more times a day and closes itself randomly. Now after I've uninstalled and reinstalled Im unable to access my profile. Fix this promptly, Instagram has always been a great app so I won't let this MONTHS long dilemma tarnish my perception of it. Just fix it. Thanks.",1
"The new feature sucks. Not just it's aesthetically non pleasing but now while making story the ""typewriter, neon, classic etc. etc"" list used to show up below text and align and the on color thing on top. Now everything is on top. So insta how tf do i access them??? Also the reels don't work in stories without clicking on them. The refreshing is horrible. Now when post goes against guidelines it automatically stops your account without a freakin msg. Very poor updates.",1
When i download instagram my whole mobile data Is slowed...i don't why is then any problem with this app or my mobile but the lite version is normal there's no issue with that...,1
Instagram is selling porn. Too many porn accounts are automatically followed and Instagram just allows user to remove/unfollow 10 accounts per day,1
"Adding pictures to a layout that actually fits the picture and screen, as it once did, has digressed to the point that has made posting more than one picture in an appealing way, impossible. From my experience, no one wants to swipe right through a stack of 10 pictures or load 50 stories. They want to scroll top to bottom through all that they follow, not stop at each one, and side swipe. This has made IG almost unusable, in my opinion. Fix the layout option, please. If it ain't broke...",1
"It's really annoying! Everytime I open my Instagram it always says couldn't refresh feed. I couldn't even load my own photos. I already tried to update it but still don't work smoothly. Even trying to log out is really hard, it will took soooo long. At first, I thought it's just because of my poor internet connection, but it's purely Instagram issues! What's the problem? Please fix it!",1
"This Instagram is giving me headache. It's crashing and crashing. Have search online if I can find help, couldn't find any. This is stressing me. Everytime I open it, it automatically closes within a minute. It annoying. Help please, I have somethings to upload. And it's not allowing. And also my comment on my post are automatically turned off, tried turning it on, and it didn't work. Help please.",1
"Does anyone know why I do not have an option for auto caption in reels, literally doesn't show up?",1
"Bad, I don't even know why my account got suspended and there is no email or message telling me about it. I can't even retrieve or get help on this matter.",1
"loved the app before the updates, now it's basically unusable. everything is action-blocked for no reason, you get sent back to the very top of someone's page after viewing one of their photos, and all older posts are hidden and replaced with suggested posts. the explore page is there for a reason, we don't want them combined. it feels less personal and user-oriented and more like a business trying desperately to just cram things they think people like together.",1
"Fix the landscape-video issue already!!!! In order to post landscape vid I have to uninstall to reset with older version which works fine, then it updates itself and can no longer choose between square/landscape. This has been a known issue for many people.. I'm beyond being patient - stop focussing on moving the buttons around to get everyone on the store and fix it for content creators!",1
"The app keeps on stopping, i cleared the cash and downloaded the latest version of Instagram and my phone is totally updated and the app is still doing a crash. Adding to that, the Instagram reels are not available in my app and i can't reach many features such as vocal calls only so i won't have to make a video call then turn off the camera . Also i can't use filters when I go live. I hope you fix the bugs as soon as possible.",1
"I've liked Instagram for so long but lately ( this last year) it's been glitchy. It's doesn't show videos. It's doenst allow you to add music. You as account gets disabled for no reasons. The algorithm changes and the whole thing goes south. It's not been enjoyable at all. Update - June 2021 - it's getting worse. I had use of reels, just as I start using it for my business properly it vanishes. At this rate i want to find a new platform. Pretty rubbish experience all together. :(",1
"Initially, it was great. Now, none of the edit functions on videos work, reels are buggy and cant add more than 2 videos and the feedback I've sent about it was never answered. I've tried updating my phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app and even tried changing my user status from private to business, all to no avail. Pretty unimpressed if I'm brutally honest.",1
"I updated it after a long time of not doing so and I regret it. I check the notifications ever so often but now that it's on the top off the homescreen, it is annoying to get there now. Also, the ads on the home feed and stories were almost tolerable, but now they want me to get accustomed to more ads on the bottom bar where the notification button was? Also, the app keeps crashing when I press the upload button. So now I basically cant post anything at all, post or story. Horrible.",1
It's pretty amazing how quickly Facebook has been able to destroy Instagram. Basic functionality is lost (such as posting multiple pictures) as the emphasis is now becoming a short clips app to rival Tik Tok. Here's a radical suggestion: concentrate on what you're good at and stop trying to dominate every other medium and platform.,1
"For last 2 weeks my news feed does ne work at all! It just freeze whenever I try to scroll down. DM works only if I open it from notifications. I tried uninstalling it couple of times and it works for about 15 seconds and it freezes again. Worst update in a long time! Btw it works perfectly on PC, but on mobile, very bad. Edit: 10 days after this review it got good, but it happened again about a week ago. Something is not working properly..",1
"This is an awful app - it used to be good but they've been messing about with it over the last few months so it's been as glitchy as hell. It either freezes on opening, when scrolling or sliding between photos on a post, or lags when scrolling, etc. It would be better if they just withdrew the app altogether until they got their act together and employed someone who could actually write programs that worked - there's enough people out there, so ask one of them to sort it, for god's sake!!",1
it always says that the story was already shared to facebook but it's not... some stories were missing in the facebook archive,1
"Stuff won't load, sound won't play randomly, sometimes not archived stories from several years ago (which shouldn't be saved by insta) get deleted and you get a notification that you might lose your account for this bs, app crashes, inability to send voice messages longer than a minute, uses way too much mobile data. Could go on for ages...",1
"I deactivated my account at the beginning of the summer for a socials break and I have been trying reactivate since the end of July. The two-step verification is not working. The code does not work when entered and I've emailed support several times with absolutely no help. They keep telling me to complete the verification, WHICH DOESNT WORK. So it's now October and I still have no access to my account because no one wants to look into this, apparently very common, problem. Fix your app!",1
Why is there still no way to pause reels? That's all I want and you people can't figure it out! The app is up to date so don't even think about telling me to update it,1
"I was pretty good previously, but for the past 2 weeks I am facing an issue. If I see a video and then move to the next video, sometimes the audio of the first video overlaps and continues to play. It doesn't stop until I reboot my mobile, at that time I will not be able to mute the video also. This issue happens everytime I use instagram. Don't know if this happens only to me, or for anyone else.I thought it was a bug and was actually waiting for an update. Instagram team- please look into this",1
"Videos/reels load in 2(previously 3) second bursts no matter what my connection status is - I have had full connection, on multiple different networks both wifi and data, and the videos were still loading at three seconds a pop it makes no sense. It's not like YouTube where you can pause it and wait for the video to load, the video won't load unless it's playing so you get a stop and start video. No possible way to change view quality, so I can't even lower it to see if that helps with loading.",1
"Please fix these bugs. I am unavailable to upload any picture with description and hastags. After typing the whole thing,It's really annoying to see your picture with a blank description. Even the edit option is not useful in this case. It always shows with a popup ""you're edits weren't saved. Please try again"". Please do something.",1
"Horrible I only need an account to do something for a school project, BUT I CAN'T EVEN REGISTER FOR ONE. I've gone through 2 email accounts and when the account setup starts, it decides to stop working. Not only that, I also can't use the email accounts i've already used for another account. please fix this problem, the app is really buggy.",1
"From a user experience designer view, the update is absolutely terrible. Instagram rather tricks people into spending more money than keeping functionalities which were intuitive and had become a habit in the same place. Is Instagram a platform to post images and videos on or are you switching to shopping or being the new Netflix completely? Make it easier for your app to be used in the way it was meant to be. Move the 'post' and 'activity' button to the position they should be in.",1
"Update: It stopped working on my wifi. I need to have mobile data to access instagram. There is no setting in phone to change that. I have reinstalled it more than a 100 times now. Not exaggerating!! Keeps crashing. Since the last updated, the app keeps crashing and i need to keep uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I have to reinstall it atleast 4 times in a day. Please remove this bug.",1
"Absolute rubbish. Keeps logging me out, then when I log back in I get notifications saying a new log in was made on a device I've not used before (I've actually been using the same device for 9 months) so I have to go through the verification process...then I get locked out of my account anyway. Completely useless. Of course you can't actually contact anyone to fix the issue, just like Facebook.",1
"From last night it started to crash and not load whenever I went onto the app. It says to varify my security code by sending my email address, but each time I did this it still hasn't sent me the security code to my email address. Before this happened I tried to see whether there was an option to block followers from calling me, which I feel is wrong, intrusive and irritating when I'm busy trying to upload a load of photos. There seems to be no way in which to block this feature.",1
"The whole point of Instagram is to connect with others and share photos. Not being able to view likes is the most pointless and frustrating change I've ever seen a social media platform make. I also find that the likes dont update properly when you're viewing your own photos. I have only posted one photo since the change and Instagram used to be the media outlet I used the most, but I just find myself not enjoying it as much. Please change it back soon.",1
"Too many bugs. To start I have one of the best CPU available in the market right now with 6GB of RAM. It suddenly stops without reason. There is no point on changing something if it works worse than the previous one. First make it reliable and then sell it. I quit Instagram, I don't want to pay for this.",1
"Ruined by updates taking this platform in a direction to incorporate the worst features from others. The latest updates have moved core features such as the ""new post"" button to a location much less accessible on all smartphones, effectively kicking it down the hierarchy of features. New buttons such as ""reels"" presumably a competitor to tiktok has been moved front and center to one of the main spots along the row of buttons within easy reach. A ""shop"" has also been added!?!? RIDICULOUS",1
"Hey, my ig music is not working, for every songs I type, it says no results found and certain songs which I have neverrrrr heard, seen are shown!!!!! It's not working for my reels or the stories. I have reported this problem in the app and nothing has changed yet since a week now. Kindly make it right ASAP Yes, I uninstalled and reinstalled the app for 3 times now. Kindly make it work ASAP.",1
I should be able to globally disable the auto play of video from all sources. Including advertising,1
I have a business and personal account. I'm not able to see or create REELS in my business account! Both accounts are having different interface. The personal account is having all the latest features including reels. I've updated / deleted and reinstalled the app a bunch of times. Please let me know if I'm missing something!!,1
"It crashes again and again. I have to keep re-installing it. My stories failed to upload due to some ""error"" apparently. My snaps failed to send for no reason. I can see app's built-in emojis sometimes and most of the time it is square boxes. üò°üò° Instagram music app doesn't work most of the time. Instagram randomly stops working and shuts down itself. This app has new problem every other day since Facebook owned it.",1
The dms are not working. Trashy experience. It has gone down with recent updates,1
"Latest updates are very annoying. The suggested posts are irritating, the feature isn't needed as that's what discover is for. However the worst ""new feature"" by far is how someone's feed resets to the top once you've clicked on any of their posts and then gone back. I assume this is a glitch as it's a bizarre feature to add but it's been happening for a while now.",1
"Absolute rubbish! Wanted me to follow only the suggestions suggested and wanted to use the microphone - God know what for, but I don't trust them. A confusing and badly-thought out app which had me going in circles looking for features. I gave up and removed it from my tablet as it is much more trouble than it's worth. It won't even rotate to landscape - on a 10"" tablet! Avoid!",1
"I am unable to use reels feature and also it is not letting me listen story music. Everytime i see a story with music , it shows Instagram music not available in your region. But at the same time in other phone at same location it is letting me use that feature. Really pathetic service by Instagram. Very disappointed by this issue kindly resolve it asap!!!!!",1
I have a problem in my account with a photo story It will be skipped automatically in a millisecond. But if the story is video. It haven't a problem,1
"What did you do with the latest update?!! Completely ruined it... it is constantly crashing, can't refresh the feed or dms, I cannot use the app. Thank you very much. I think all other 1-star reviews from the last week are enough for you to start fixing this issue ffs. 06Jul2022 update - bring back square shaped feed!!! Or at least provide a selection view we can choose from. And it's crashing all the time, can't upload anything properly. (Eye roll)",1
Instagram not working from last 3-4 days but Instagram tecnical team not looking in this matter,1
"I complained hundreds of times that im not able to relpy for a selected message and only like option is there for a post. I also reinstalled , sent email, used customwr care . No reply nothing. I have kept it only cuz of my friends or insta is trash.no relpy yet been 5months now and asking reveiw.",1
My Instagram is not showing me anyone's stories and my feed is full blank and why Msgs are not going to anyone,1
"It's not refreshing. So many glitches bugs can't see new content,stories,post",1
"It was so difficult ,letest update is very bad , regular user plz do not update it was harmful for your device or not best for use",1
"The latest update is awful. Now i can't even find posts, it annoys me that the first thing i see now are all reels and videos. And worse is:i like saving my posts in different albums, so what i usually do with videos is i save them and then organize them by their proper album, but now because of the new layout of reels and videos it is impossible to do so, and sometimes when viewing my feed the like, comment and share buttons don't even appear. Not everyone likes to see reels all the time! >:(",1
"App keeps closing on me for months, have to re install after deleting, this has been done about 15 times",1
"It's too bad üò° my Instagram is not updating, i update it 8 times but it's still the same , it's too bad plzz check it .",1
"I have so many problems with the DMs. Firstly, even though I updated the app until the latest version, I cannot reply to people's messages like everyone can. Secondly, lately whenever I send an audio or video, they don't send and whatever messages I send after those don't send either. I tried rebooting my phone and checked my connection, but it's not because of that. Furthermore, I can still receive people's messages and it marks it as read for them, so they think I'm ignoring them. PLS FIX THIS",1
Impossible to create reels on s22 plus. Imported videos stutter and IG keeps freezing or crashing,1
Scumbags just added a feature or bug where an ad jump scares you while you are looking at a post :(,1
I am having white screen issue from last 3days. I did every possible way of resolving it but I can't please fix this,1

I just updated because I need to update the app to be able to use some filters. And the update is so annoying!!!! The layout doesn't fit the screen on my phone. There is an odd space at the bottom that doesn't do anything. Just white space!!! The layout is overall annoying! When you want to post a story and picked a photo or video the layout is different now. It's complicated too much space is being occupied by unneccessary things!!! Why do you always have to change layouts and whatnots!!!,1
Now the app asks for your phone # so it can share it with their advertisers and it wont start unless you put a verufiable #...after 10 yrs :unistalled!,1

Poor and just wants to be like TikTok. The emphasis is now on reels and will hardly push any of my content to less than 10% of my followers. Shame as it used to be so good but the algorithms seem to favour stupid video clicks rather than any content shared my talented makers.,1
"I've never had any major issues with instagram until now. I am unable to edit and of my posts. Every time I try to, it shows ""we restrict certain activities to protect our community"". Also my layout recently changed to the new layout, where the like button is on the top right of the screen. After I reinstalled the app, the layout has reverted back to the older layout where the like button is it the bottom right of the screen.",1
"Bad customer support. Don't invest much time in such unreliable app. If you signal for errors, there is no-one to fix it. I'm not able to reply to comments under my own posts, there is also a text from previously failed upload that just stays on my feed. I got used to it so it doesn't bother me, but there is actually no customer support. I sent them feedback and reported problems many times, but nothing was ever solved. This is what happens when you replace human employees with an algorithm.",1

"Removed the explore page in favour of reels. No way to choose what you're seeing and all the topics which I could scroll through on explore is gone... such as you could click on a food post and scroll through more food posts. Should have a better video interface. Needs pause and play options, fast forward rewind (double tap) etc Update: reels in the main page have the top and bottom cut off, you can't click on them to make them full screen, cant double tap to skip 10 seconds, cant pause",1

"You know what? People usually update the application to make it better. But you guys are ultimate opposite of that. The more you update the app the worse it gets. So, for godsake please don't update the app unless you really do what's people favorite...",1
"The new update with full screen is bad, very bad. You can't divide one post from another, one account from another, it's seems the endless post, that I even don't want to see. Also, you can't read the captions. I find myself closing the app as soon as I opened it. The app has become very uncomfortable to use.",1

I thought Instagram is a good app but when I try to sign in it always says 'sorry there was a problem with your request ',1
This new reel focussed update is garbage. It's a pain to mute reels and you have to do it every time you open the app. Scrolling right on multiposts requires some level of accuracy otherwise you're scrolling in an unintended direction. When open a post that has text in the body of the post it overlays on the image and makes it very difficult to read.,1

If you want to make reels just give up now. The app constantly crashes will trying to make a reel which makes you lose any progress you had timed out. This happens ALL the time. It also just won't load the reels part so you can't add any clips or it won't let you change the timer. Garbage app. Don't push us to make reels if the reels won't even work.,1
I think instagram lite us better than this one i cant watch reels in this app when i try to watch showing dark blank column,1
"Annoying, stickers dissappear, app turns into a crazy combination between light and dark mode where it is impossible to notice the buttons.

"Used to love it, but every new update seems to care less and less about UX. The latest layout change is horrible, annoying, and distracting with changing multiple colors (due to videos and pictures) filling up your screen. My timeline recently features MORE advertisements and recommendations than updates from my connections. And even after enabling the Data Saver option, videos would still automatically start as you scroll. Seriously, what were you thinking????",1
There is no option to turn off reels. I don't want to see reels please add this option,1
Why to update again when download new !! Double data loss!!!,1
"Bugs start.,.and doesn't fix..",1
Worst social media app ever....lags every time You should have to improve and fix most of the bugs...,1
"Might as well change the name to pornhub or porngram, this app is no more a social media app its not a porn app.",1
In this app so many bugs when I am go to upload videos it's not uploaded,1
Time to time message are not send and many more problems are there please improve as you do fast,1
Automatically screenshot has been taken no security while conservation,1
Howbabout getting rid of the suggested people thing in my newsfeed. And just let me see posts from people i follow. And how about putting the newsfeed in chronilogical order. Sick of seeing same posts over & over & over.,1
Would love to print out the code of this app and use it as toilet paper.,1
What the hell is going on ....... there are so many glitches.. i m not getting text from anyone i m speechless about insta pls try to fix it,1
Showing my password incorrect and even after changing its showing incorrect,1
"My Instagram hacked recently I complaint many time but no one response me a single time, it's my private account I lost my privacy my friends , and hacker use my I'd for doing scams I need solution",1
Hi dear Instagram I am regular users this app and I like use this app but I have some problem I can't send massage any one please solve my problem as wall as soon never mistake again thank you,1
It hangs many times and when there is a update the app is almost like frozen for reels,1
"It's been okay. I've had many experiences where I've put together layers of photos or one photo. Writing a very meaningful experience. When I go to post it, it delays and then stops loading. There is no option to save and repost later. Instead I have to delete the whole post. Frustrating",1
I'm not getting that creating reels option and notes are also not visible kindly fix this problem asap,1
My massages delivering is very slow it's very irritating I have that insta bug,1
"What the Hack,. Whyyy app is crashing, no massages showing, no notifications, reels hanging",1
"Unable to get to the log in screen. I open the app, get the insta icon then just a white screen. I have uninstall, reinstalled, no joy, I have uninstall, turned off phone, waited, turned phone back on and reinstalled, still nothing. I reset permissions, reset my phone and downloaded again but still wont work. This has been going on for over a week. I can get on using Web but not through the app. Any advice/tips would be great. Thanks",1
"Probably the worst app I have ever used. I've no idea how it remains popular. Publishing a post with multiple photos is almost impossible and there are too many bugs to even begin to list them. It's taken me around 2 hours to publish 2 posts, each with 10 photos, eventually completing it on Windows! This is not unusual either due to it bombing out to story mode or choosing photos by default instead of what I selected. I think today will be my last post, life really is too short for Instagram",1
Thier policies sucks. They blocked my account and then deletef it saying that i did something against community guidelines but what they don't know and then ultimately they deleted my account and not even letting me download my data. And this is not all now they are not evn letting me create a new account with email number second email nothing.,1
"Very poor ,, my id did not work properly and on this issue i report on instagram but there hi no solution very poor i have a bad experience on insta",1
"Account got hacked and no matter how much I've tried to get in contact with them, they are not doing anything about it... it's a been a couple of months now.",1
not sure what it's for. It is complicated to learn. I gave been trying to figure it out for a very long time. That is why I am giving it one star now rather than to two stars it gave it before.,1
"My Instagram had been working fine for the past couple years that I have had it; afew minor bugs here and there but manageable. The other day, I went to go onto Instagram and it would not work at all. I have tried everything : uninstalling then reinstalling it multiple times, resetting my whole phone, looking for any possible updates, but nothing has worked. Idk what's happened but I know for a fact that this is not just me, multiple of my friends have been having the same issues. Dudee??",1
"Everything went smooth until it updated and it takes too long to load unlike before. It's disappointing since it also took too much space in my storage and even if I clear browsing data, it keeps on loading especially in reels and posts. I already re-install it for 5 times and more but it is still very slow. I hope you can fix this issue since a lot of users have the same problem as mine based on the other reviews.",1
Can you bring back removing reels from your feed page I don't understand why you got rid of this. The option no longer exists,1
Its so buggy like I don't understand. I'm watching a story and it skips it in 2 seconds and I can't go back to see it.... Instagram do better.,1
"Hello Insta Team, Need your immediate assistance to delete an account that is pretending to be my account. Someone else is downloading my posted videos & posting it in similar account ID of mine no idea who is managing the account Also my profile photo is being used. Kindly assist. If required I can attach screen shot & account ID to proceed further from your side. Please let me know asap what can done to over come this. Thanks!!!",1
Horrible app that I was avoiding using. it's a car crash to use and not an enjoyable experience but necessary evil. Why do the development team get these things so badly wrong,1
Something wrong with the sharing message box as the favorite persons being in random order after the last update.. need to leave the chat box after viewing a picture to reply text.. hope can solve the issue,1
The bad app All the time I wont make account again all the time so instgram take it for it or some one american this is joke ü§£ü§£ every time they use somthing on you and banned the account or flash from all the web,1
Some one hacked my cousin account tryed to get us to send money and take are money Instagram threating to close me down but there's a bunch of robbers having there page n porn females . Instagram wrong for the way yall be.,1
"I had to re install the app because it kept closing and logging me out and when I re installed it, i logged in and the music option for your stories was gone! Gimme back that option please.",1
It has been one of my best app but now it is going worse. The new update can't remove login accounts......,1
Sisyphus Fails Again and Again. I try to train the algorithms to show me content I want. It works for a while then reverts right back to generic booty shorts and #blessed brag posts from minor celebrities. Why is Insta set up to be a never-ending battle to dictate the content I see?,1
"I am unable to post stories and posts , unable to comment unable to share anything ....instagram has started getting worse",1
Although this app is amazing but there are many glitches in between.. I request you look after it..,1
For some reason all the people i send posts to are now at the bottom and I have to scroll through multiple sections before I even get to them. Much rather prefer them to be back at the top/first options again like before.,1
After updated the apps 2 day ago cant log in. Already uninstall and reinstall back. Still facind same problem cant log in,1
"Instagram features getting worse day by day, I've so many complain about this about, the process of reels is so disturbing, the background music is getting noisy, bad, after using the same audio, please look at this...",1
"I'm nit able to use latest updates from Instagram. I can't add a 60s long story. Every one can add. I've updated to latest version also. Thukali app. I've reported many times, still no response.",1
Did an update yesterday and required my cell number.. I refused to add and now it says can't refresh feed... so I guess I'll go to tictoc..,1
"Very very bad app {I'd deactivation problems facing too much ,too much ads , and so many glitches and lags also }",1
My issue is that I can spot serval glitches and kinks that should have been aired out by now let alone years ago. My second issue is you guys disabling my accounts and making it damn near impossible. I wasn't doing anything besides creating accounts and what's wrong with that? So what I have a business model or a unique attraction to both and it's actually frustrating when you shut my businesses social media down shortly after creating it and bout love to talk to someone personally about this,1
The reel algorithm is so bad that it supports only big creators and doesn't even provide good opportunity for new ones. The biggest thing is that the app developers doesn't want to fix it,1
"Stuck at Couldn't refresh feed. Tried everything, not working. Finally uninstalling.",1
"The algorithm for the recommendation is garbage, you watch 1 photo of a banana, and your entire front page will be a banana photoshoot. On top of that the video player randomly stops when trying to watch a reel or a video leaving the audio playing with a static image. On top of that the button ""why are you seeing this post"" is completely useless because if you click it it just always tells you that post are shown based on many things. It's not hard, I don't like football don't make it appear",1
"The app is garbage now. It has too many new features with out the maintenance of the core feature, what ever that is. Tbh I don't know what kind of app it wants to be anymore. Its just CRAWLING in bugs like, my stories are not being archived properly and I'm losing some of them. I can't post multiple images without the app crashing. Very poor performance in general. I love sharing to friends on this platform but if I could give it -10 stars I would.",1
"i used to enjoy this app, but frequent updates and too many changes have caused the app to become a glitchy hell. ive had it crash several times just today. too many glitches please fix that",1
"After the last updates, I barely see the people I'm following, I mostly see only stuff I don't want to. Even to an extent that I feel like IG is trying to hold me looking at the screen for as long as possible. And I hate it. You turned into a terrible network that feasts on people's time...",1
"Used to be a great place to share pictures and build communities, but they've changed their algorithm to force videos from large ""Influencer"" accounts you couldn't give two farks about into your feed instead of seeing your friend's posts. Will happily revise this if they decide to fix it.",1
"1) I see you removed my honest but critical review 2) I have a zfold 3. You dynamically change the size for adverts when the phone changes from folded to open, but don't for posts. You did have this feature but deleted it for some reason? 3) Stop suggesting posts in the main feed",1
Fix your broken log in on multiple devices issue! I log in on a device and logs my account out on others!,1
Very Bad I do not recommend it the app keeps glitching deleting it is the best decision I have made in the past 1min STOP TELLING ME THAT MY COMMENT IS BAD,1
An absolute wasteland of irrelevant ads and sponsored posts. Making it almost impossible to actually see and engage with people I follow. Gone from an amazing place to share art and content to a complete disaster.,1
I m facing a problem which is my Instagram is not working on my mobile data and also on wifi i deleted and reinstalled but the problem is still there so how can that this hope u will fix this ASAP thank you . worst customer careüò°,1

Users account not showing in searchlist when not blocked. Need bug fix for this with new update,1
The app doesn't display properly when dark theme is selected. Please fix.,1
Instagram won't send an email to reset my password and I got a new phone so can't sign in with the device without it. I have been unable to access my Instagram for two days due to this. They don't have customer service so I can't even get help.,1
"New update is total rubbish. The home screen sucks and makes it impossible to swipe through photos like you used to be able to, when i try to swipe through photos it just takes me down to the next ""post"". It's like everything is a constant video. Hate it. Trying to find out a way to get my insta back to the previous update where instagram actually looked good and was user friendly",1
The app does not show any solution of my problem. Very bad app on reporting any problem it does not give any solution,1
App is constantly crashing and having glitches.I have 2 delete and redownload this app multiple times in week so it works. Edit:Its now multiple times a day Edit to the Edit:Its now every few minutes,1
Buggy application. Keeps loading always. Can't even refresh the screens.,1
For some reason Instagram does not seem to be working. This is not the first time it has stopped working. What is the reason for HIDDEN REQUESTS?,1
Not able to use the application from last 2 days even not able to report the problem from help section.,1
Awful foldable experience. Doesn't work properly on the z fold 3 in either folded or unfolded modes. Updated 3 months later as still awful.,1
Very bad service ...story not the post Always error problem,1
ü§ï this instgram is having more bug when i switch my account i can't see my inbox message please fix it soon the inbox is not showing message after account switch,1
"Used to be a good app now it's full of bugs, errors and sleep outs. Every time I try to open archives the app closes and it won't let me check my insights. Instagram is just trash now, should've left it the way it was instead of making a mess put of it",1
Im praying a black company comes out with a better social media option than this and fb. They need a lot of changes for it to work better. If it wasnt for business i would not have a account.,1
Instagram keeps getting worse. If you're an artist skip this. Only about 5 percent of my followers see my posts. Went from 500 likes per post to 75 on average. Ig is trash.,1
Since this most recent update... My app has been crashing really bad. Haven't been able to do much with app. Can't access linktree or stores for those I follow. Pretty useless if you as me.,1
Frequently logout from my both andro√≠d and Iphone device suddenly it allows to login from one device only this is worst thing Meta can do oh meta comeon 60% users have more then 2 device how could you do this,1
When i update this app i can't send messages to my friend its always stops on sending .. and also my reel sharing options are mixed. All my friends whom i send reels are not showing on top Fux this,1
"STOP WITH THE REELS. STOP THE SUGGESTED POSTS. I just want to see posts from people I follow in chronological order. My feed is now full of suggested posts I absolutely do not want to see. I only want to see posts from who I follow, but now it's nothing but spam posts after the first couple.",1
"Too much of problems in this updates, please improve app stability",1
"It is unsafe! It's a long time that I want to delete the number that I gave to Instagram, but it doesn't work. I'm a teenage girl and Instagram has suspended two of my accounts just becaus using profanity as jokes. But since a year ago I and many other people have been reporting a page that was posting many photos of animal abuse, and this account has not been suspended or restricted yet..!!! It's a shame ! really ! and I say this after six years of use ! you lost an active user.",1
"It has been several weeks, the reels don't open and buffering takes forever!",1
Awful app! Used to be ok. Now a wrong press on a spam account and instantly fallow 1 billion fake account from different country's! How to unfallow 500 accounts?? üòÇ,1
"Lots of bugs in the crucial features and there are featured you'd never want to use, which makes no sense to me. A LOT of advertising. But ok. It was still fun. Until the app stopped working altogether. üò© It just goes black screen and nothing happens. No way to seek support from the company. Maybe it's a sign to just stop using it",1
"After latest update, unable to view any reels. After refreshing the reels page it says we're sorry and try again but no reels shows up. Please check this bug/issue.",1
"When I installed new update it's so irritated me when I liked someone posts, story, or anything it's not like there so please solve this problem",1
Way too many FORCED advertising. TONS of posts that I DO NOT want to see. Can't view my real friends content because its buried underneath a bunch of accounts that I DONT EVEN LIKE. In the last yea this entire app has turned to Garbage. So sad. We all used to love insta.,1
"This app is very worst ,my Instagram account has been disabled without any reason.",1
I can't login for my account from 2 apps. Now I have to login every time & I'm sick of it. Even when I confirm it was me who login still it doesn't work. You making it worse for trying to increasing security.,1

"Dreadful! I have been using Instagram for years quite happily. Some time ago it stopped working, every time I tried to open it, it crashes. I can't do anything with it at all. I have tried to contact them for help on many occasions and not only can i not talk to anyone I can't even get through on e mail!! There customer service is appalling/non existent. Great app, just don't expect any help when it goes wrong",1

Please run your systems up and reassure your participants a better quality control and Customer satisfaction.",1
"App is not interested l have no highlight option in story and no malayalam songs for story, Instagram suggested songs only show",1

"It was going very smoothly before. I uninstalled it because of storage and installed it today. But somehow it wasn't working. When you open the app, it shows the logo intro then white. Just white. Literally just white. Please help. I've tried everything i know. I tried reinstalling, i tried clearing the cache and data, i tried uninstalling and reinstalling it again and it is still not working.

"Your reel editing is the absolute worst. I'm trying to adjust a clip so that the audio lines up where I want. But as I slide the clip over to a different section of the video, the audio keeps playing as if it started at the beginning of the video. Not the start of the adjusted clip. If I move it over enough, the audio doesn't even play. So I guess at where it might work. And when it's not where I want it, I hit the back button and it takes me to the add a video page, and I have to start over...",1

"Your algorithm is Trash, forcing random suggested posts down my throat and not showing my posts to my followers. Plus the hashtags don't work anymore since my photos never show up there anymore, so they're basically useless. Its become too much like Tiktok, and killed itself doing so.",1

The apps cool for chatting and stuff but I suddenly got banned or something cause I can't use my account so I had to make a different but I want my old one back cause it has pictures I posted that are very important to me,1
I'm really disappointed! The app keeps giving me every kind of different action blocks and it needs to stop. It's hurting my reach and engagement. Really annoying üòî,1
Everything was good.. But it has been 3 days I got so many issues in this.. Like I tried a lot to log in my account but it's doesn't work.. I missed so many things because of this problem..its bad üëéplease solve the problem as soon as possible,1
"I used to love it so much, but the latest update made me shock and uncomfortable. The new interface/layout is terrible, annoying and very distracting, it fills up the screen with multiple colors and stuff. Now I feel so much uncomfortable scrolling through posts. Tons of ads appear in my timeline endlessly, also videos play automatically. Y'all always fix things that are not broken.. and they're always getting worse. Bring back the previous layout!!",1
I was hacked and Instagram NEVER helped me recover my old acct NOR did they deactivate my old account and the hacker was able to hack a bunch of other people pretending to be me. Not okay. IG has to fix that or people will start walking away,1
"It just doesn't work. Everytime I try to open the app it just shows a blank screen and doesn't respond. Tried restarting the phone, reinstalling the app but still it just doesn't not work. Ever since I tried using the selfie Giphy thing in a DM, it didn't send my messages after that an I tried reinstalling and it hasn't worked since then. It's been almost 3 weeks. Congratulations Instagram, you've lost a lot of users because of this glitch.",1
"This app is not updated ..there is no option to change themes , swip msgs and other little things.",1

Nowadays facing so many problems in Instagram like reloading very slow processing so many changes slow uploading app not working so many problems,1
"Team instagram please help me.. I got suspended for nothing. I dont even post daily or anything but i really want my account back. Please help me quick. I cant even login or logout, its just stuck.",1
I don't like that it only supports phone size on my Chromebook. I can't read any of the caption at the top of the screen for each reel.,1
Doesn't load most of the time. I have to turn of wi-fi to load and sometimes that doesn't even work. Been like this for at least a year. I know it's not my phone because all my friends have the same issue.,1
It's not working from last 2 days I can't see massages and the main page is not opening,1
"The way this app feeds you posts just sucks. On your home page you'll get the same things over and over until you like the post, which means you'll see the posts you dislike more often than the posts you do like Same thing happens with the explore feed. I see posts from accounts that I do not like, I never like their posts, click on their posts, or even look at their post for too long, but yet the algorithm forces it down my throat regardless The algorithm also only likes videos now which SUCKS",1
"The support for this app is abysmal. I have a personal account and at least 4 times it's been suspended for, according to them breaking terms of service, only for me to submit a report and get it back. This is just a bad joke and at this point I don't think it's worth it. I only keep it to keep in touch with people.",1
I suddenly can't access all the photos in my phones gallery. Only a small selection. It looks like others are having the same problem. Hopefully it's fixed soon,1
Z fold users have experienced terrible experience with each update. Every update is worse than the last.,1

My new aacount have no music option and in my old I can't tag any direct messages üòï.........after I complaint many time instagram didn't take any actions,1
Very bad app because I am putting reel and post Eveready but even then not increasing follower and view and also the app doesn't tells about how to earn money on Instagram and how get Blue tick,1
"Instagram is a complete joke, would be great if they did something about all the scammers. Sick of reporting fake celebrity accounts and Instagram doing nothing.",1
"Instagram has overlooked many features on the Android version available in the iOS version. Photos, when taken within Instagram or uploaded from my phone's gallery, appear blurry on my story. The photo capture within Instagram doesn't allow tap to focus and other features available in my camera. It also does not allow users to align text and images ""magnitically"" to lock the content horizontally as seen on the iOS version. Overall, the interface is buggy and laggy, and is in dire need of fixing.",1
"Worst app, there is so many glitches, bugs and all.. Even it doesn't provide me with all the funtions",1
"Very bad.! I started hating this app. Whenever i select a song from music as my story (pic) it plays. But when anyone watch my story or i watch my story after some time it states that ""This song is currently unavailable"" why you gave that song as an option when it is not going to play!! This is very annoying!! Till now it happened every time. whenever i do so.!!",1
1. Instagram's not letting me add posts to story. This has been happening for a few days now 2. I am unable to see my saved filters. When i go onto the filter it shows saved. But I'm not able to see. Its hidden or something 3. I have saved a lot of sounds. But its saying no sounds saved. I can see them for a second but they disappear and this message comes. Instagram please look into it,1
"With every new update there is a new bug,crash. For example, the app crashes when trying to see a user's story from a post from home screen. Or, on videos you might like screen, the video stucks, but the sound continues. On the same screen, auto switch to next video doesnot work, the same happens, it switches to the next video, but the video is stuck, and the sound from the PREVIOUS video plays. Facepalm.",1
"Instagram has always worked well when I used it but at the moment there are various bugs. ‚Äì I can't upload stories, they just load for ages and if I exit the app, it gets like cancelled and doesn't upload at all (waiting doesn't work either it just loads and loads and loads). ‚Äì It's also showing me my chat notifications with quite a delay. Someone could've sent me something and I will only receive the notification quite a bit later (1 example: an hour later). Everything else seems to be fine.",1
It's stopped working! Tried logging out and back in again. Still nothing.,1
"I upgraded my Instagram app around a week ago, but instead of got the latest features, mine was downgraded:) the interface, the features, was all the old one (for example, the Reels feature is missing, and also the notification navigation goes back to the right bottom, the music feature also missing). I've uninstalled and reinstalled it for fourth times now, but it changes nothing. Please fix this!",1
"I just wanted to watch a few reels before bed. I lay down and opened Insta,and when I clicked the Reels button, there was a error saying something went wrong. I read recent reviews. This HAS happened to several people now (I took quick scan. I'm not sure exact amount, but quite a few). My internet if completely fine. Fix this problem, then I'll reinstall.",1
"I'm starting to become convinced that Meta (Facebook) purposely designs their stuff to be a pain. Like, they insist the must add something shiny, just cuz, and it makes using it a bigger pain. Anyway, this snap scrolling or whatever it's called is driving me up the wall.",1
"Update has broken everything. Reels no longer auto play. The mute button has vanished. If you want to send a specific slide from a post to someone, unlucky. When using dark mode, you get dark mode sometimes. Sometimes the background goes white and the text also stays white. Superb. Videos randomly freeze. The feed sometimes randomly refreshes and takes you back to the top. Needs a lot of fixing",1
Some days before it was working completly fine but now it is not working after opening the app it is showing only blank white screen. I also try to reinstall and update the app but it's not working. Please fix this problem.,1
It was used to be my fav app but now everytime when i log in it says no user belong to this account and password. Plz sort out this issue,1
"After a couple of updates over the last month or so this app no longer opens, just goes white and returns to home screen. I have lost count of how many times I've cleared cached data and reinstalled. Reported the problem and no change. Don't waste your time on what was once a good app. Instagram are clearly not bothered.",1
"i cannot record videos on my story. it always say ""something went wrong please try again"". I've uninstalled the app thrice, restarted my phone a lot of times, cleared data&cache and it still won't work. I don't think it's a storage problem either. It's the thirdy day today and I already submitted a report regarding this but gotten no response. I'm so frustrated. Kindly fix this. Thanks. ps. Boomerang and Camera/filters are working just fine. Only videos aren't.",1
"Had it with this app now, far too many ads. Lot of stuff coming up that I don't want. Follow one subject, get endless posts from things that are nothing to do with what you want. Going from bad to worse month by month. Garbage just like Fb.",1
"Instagram har progressively moved from being an app whose main purpose is sharing pictures to an app where it's main purpose is keeping you on it for as long as possible. All recent updates focus on more video content, encouraging watching reels etc. Drafts are disappearing. Editing options for pictures haven't been updated in what feels like forever. You still can't change the ratio of pictures while posting multiple at a time. As a photographer I'm just getting more and more disappointed.",1
Not a good app for kids. Lot of inappropriate stuff is being uploaded over reels and there should be the parental control to the limited access,1
"I can't upload pictures in order to make a post, nor videos on stories. When I try to make a post with pics it takes ages to process and then it freezes; sometimes instead, if I try to make a post with more than a photo, it just shows me the same pic twice or three times üòë if I try to put a video in the stories, it just shows me nothing and I can't even write. This app is just impossible to use anymore",1
"Instagram is by far the most data-wasting app that has ever been made. There is no option to disable automatic video loading, leaving me to lose 20% of my data simply by opening this ridiculous app and every single video (yes, including the HD ad they put at the top) loads. On another note, the entire desktop version is completely broken to the point I can't read messages without scrolling up over a message I sent 3 months ago that just won't go away. You can't press enter to send messages, no.",1
"New update is very bad, I can't see the latest followed people. Latest & earliest are showing same‚òπÔ∏è",1
"I'm using an android phone and there's too many bugs. When saving a story, it gets stuck on 'processing' and never actually saves the photo so it ends up discarded. Also, the interface starts changing after opening the app a few times. Also, iPhone users don't experience a lot of bugs while android users have to endure an endless list of them. Talk about fair treatment. -_-",1
Making a multiple picture post on ig is a royally painful experience. Scrolling between the selected picture and the gallery is annoying with this autoscroll or auto adjustment thing (or whatever you call it) going on. And once you have selected your pictures you better have it right because if you go to the next step but decide you want to go back to change your selection of pictures you basically have to start the whole thing over again. There is so much wrong with this app I'm running out of,1
What the heck is wrong with the latest update. Have to view photos from my phones gallery if I want to post something and before I even get to post it crashes!,1
"Never goes to the correct link that was sent, always some random video which makes it kind of irrelevant",1
I appealed for restricted Facebook account and Instagram hasn't update after 24hrs...it's been almost a month. I hate this.,1
Its about 2 weeks or above the app is not starting I have to use its lite version and it has not many features like sharing video stories etc. I have to install and uninstall it many times than also its not working üò°,1
ENOUGH WITH THE REELS stop trying to be tiktok how can us instagram editors post our edits without you lot trying to turn every video into a reel,1
The 2 factor auth is the worst. I cant even receive the code. Instead of secure your account this app make you cant login üëé,1
"Trying to use this app again after 2 years of absence reminds me why I left... NOTHING works properly. NOTHING. It's so bad that I don't even know where to start, really. My dms don't work, my notifications don't work, push notifs don't work either, uploading takes up to 30 min for one picture, not even a video, despite having fast Internet available. It's not social media, it's a damn digital photobook",1
"Fantastic app when it's working, but since the last 2 updates I've been unable to use the app at all because I can't scroll through my news feed or accept requests! Sort it out, I enjoy using the app for memories that I cherish, from hard work or achievements in my life or even special places I've been to which many others can't say they have.",1
"It's a great app. But when I reported some videos, the management does not seen to take interest. When I reported a problem of reels than as well no reply came. And till now I am facing problem in reels. When i click on the option one reel loads then after that it deos not load any reels....and no one on this app is interested in listening to my problem. I wish he had an option of giving 0 stars.",1
Getting notifications for things I had seen hours before and for messages that don't exist.,1
"Awful interface. Totally confusing. After a few weeks, I still can't figure out how to view a feed for a chosen hashtag, and when I get notifications about new stories, I still can't work out how to view them in the app! To add to the confusing, the story I'm looking at often just changes to something else all by itself!! How come everyone else thinks it's so great? Confused!",1
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The last update has been literally awful and many people seem to agree. UI changes are horrible and are basically unnecessary and shoving reels down my throat doesn't make me happy either. If I'd want to watch them I would do so already.. The previous UI layout was good. I don't think anyone had a problem with it. If you don't want to change the algorithmz as many people have already requested, at least keep the UI the way people were satisfied with it.",1
"Too many bugs... Today, for example, the app started to use my camera for unknown reasons by itself. When I try to share a post from other pages as story , it's like 50/50. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, sometimes it shares same video multiple times... The most important , more you add features , more horrible the app becomes. It was supposed to be a simple app for sharing your life in pictures with your friends. I don't know what it has become, but it's horrible...",1
"Many times Likes can't be viewed on app but can be viewed by logging in from google. It keeps giving the message ""please wait a few minutes before you try again"". This goes on for hours. When we like any video, many times it so happens that the video stops but music goes on for a while. Recently I have been facing a new issue. In chats, only top half of Emojis are visible. Also, a feedback, on uploading videos and pictures we can't crop them as per our convenience.",1
"Literally i cant login into ma id they always say unexpected error occur , i just literally want to uninstall this app now so irritating",1
"Not exactly sure what's happening. App worked fine before latest update, but now the videos don't play when scrolling down the feed. But I've found that if I place 2 fingers on the screen, it will play the video as long as I don't remove contact? Watching videos on people's pages, stories etc work fine. Only have a problem on the feed.",1
"Most content is videos. Videos that freeze all the time and only the sound works. And the when they don't freeze they have no sound because ""Instagram music is not available in your region"". Both problems have persisted for years, and nobody seems to care. I certainly don't anymore.",1
"what i don't like from the current version is when you're watching a 1-minute video, it's asking you to touch the ""watch the video"" bar after 15 seconds instead of continuing the video and it's inconvenient. i can't tell which is a simple, 1-minute-duration video and which is a IGTV-material video). bring back the previous system.",1
"It be great if you could fix vertical photos. Everytime I want to post a vertical photo I am struggling with it to make it look nice. In the feed we should be able to see it as a 2X3. And then in my page I should be able to select what my little scare would show. Most of the time it crop the head of my subject. Also, I shouldn't be blocked because I follow lots of people. I was growing very fast. But then I got blocked. It seems for a month.",1
"Tried to set up an account - there's already an account associated with that address. Ok, news to me but fine. When I try to get a password reset it sends me to Facebook, then gets stuck when I try to change my username. Try to set up an account using a different email address, gets stuck on age verification page, then suspends my account for violating terms of service. Impressive, considering I have even been able to access the app yet. No further explanation. Gave up and uninstalled.",1
"Since I guess last two updates, I've been facing an issue where my instagram is not working on full screen mode, there's a big blank white bar at the bottom of the screen (right below the ""home, explore, reels, notificiations, profile"" buttons. Please fix this issue ASAP. PS: I've tried re-installing the app after every update, and it didn't fix the issue.",1
"The new update blows. I can't post videos in the 16:9 ratio which is a very big con and I've encountered a few bugs in the new update. I'm not able to add captions or tag people. This blows since I run a fanpage apart from my personal account. This has been the same for days. I honestly expected better from Instagram. And to top it off, now whenever I post videos it just shows a black screen with only the video's audio in it. Since Facebook has taken control over this app, it sucks to the core.",1
The new update has pretty much screwed everything. Horizontal clips can't be loaded in their usual format from gallery without using a third party edit app. Notifications can only be viewed once then they vanish so you can't keep up with multiple comments etc. Condensing everything to a button at the top of the screen means that you're no longer able to scroll and open posts one handed like before. It's a mess.,1
"This new version of instgram is really not worth it. 1) Videos are losing too much of a quality. Like a video of 1080p is reduced to a mere 320p video idk what clarity but really really bad. Its blurry 2) When uploading pics if you select from the drop down your preferred folder, you can scroll down but when you scroll up the entire page gets scrolled up and not the drop down, so have to select the whole image/video again. 3) Instagram needs to work on their compressing algorithm. Too much ads",1
Instagram is now the place to go for brain rotting short form tik tok style video. Let's not forget the advertisements and never ending stream of content you're NOT interested in (an Instagram speciality). If that's what you live then you've come to the right place. Anyone nostalgic for the 'good old days' of photo sharing should really check out the alternatives these days. It's time Instagram was put out to pasture.,1
"Fine until last update I've always been a fan of this app and as a designer it's great to post artwork and get social media likes. However, I tried to post something last night just after the new update and it's stuck on uploading and won't let me clear it. It's been 9 hours and I can't move to another account or delete it and I've tried everything to get it to snap out of it. Hope something gets done quickly to sort it out",1
Messeges are not seen in notification baar if insta app close my msgs problem not solvedüò† Why my notification msgs problem not solved same problem nothing changeüò†üò†üò†üò† reels and videos paused automaticallyüò°,1
Very bad. Because there are many problems in this... Like glitch etc..,1
Lately I have been experiencing a really bothersome issue. Before Instagram used to support splitting up the screen which allowed me to be able to keep in v√≠deo call while doing other things on my phone and all of the sudden it no longer supports it. While trying to get it to work I uninstalled the app and reinstall it only to make things worse because the last update was lost and it was one that modified the platform. It won't update to what it used to be and reinstalling it again won't fix it.,1
The message reply mechanic is not so smooth you really have to hold and push it to the other side to reply to the message. Also the app is not optimized and doesnt work on relatively low speed network. Also no option for cancelling an upload or sending a media item or pausing a video. Please look forward for these problems. Thanks! And blocking me from action is the worst part,1
Recently when i add others mention to my story..it looked nice like the were curve. And it was great..but now. After new updation it becom square...which was literally not nice!!! . Make that to curve border please..!!,1
"Reels don't upload. I've been trying for the past 5 days!! It appears they aren't working to fix the bugs or it's not a priority. When it does upload but isn't actually loading, it wont go away. I've looked up every trick in order to cancel it. I've had to uninstall multiple times, so many issues. I might be done with IG if issues aren't corrected afterall TikTok is becoming much more popular. Its one thing to happen but nearly a week + its not corrected? Thats awful.",1
"The app won't work even after restarting my phone, deleting and reinstalling, clearing all data, and doing literally anything I possibly can. 0 stars would be more fitting for a literally useless app",1
"Horrible , I wouldn't even give this app a one star rating if it was possible. I deactivated my account a while back, now I want to login again but can't. Been trying for a week, it says try again later. Please can you solve this problem?",1
"The new update is very bad...when I click to give reaction to the reel which was sent by my friend,it only shows ""like"" option not other emojis...the new update is trash,waste..fix this problem",1
"I can't log in on Instagram. I keep downloading every time, still the same issue. Its just blank. I can't log in my details. I can't even click on anything. This is exhausting. Please, do something about this.",1
"It just absolutely will not function. Whenever I open the app, it lags even though I have wifi and data on. I can't view anything at all",1
Please end this 3 days inbox close due to community guidelimes policy people are taking misuse of it and because of that other people are suffering i can not contact my friends because one person texted me on whatsapp to send sone pic on insta and then when i sent him that oic on insta my account inbox was blocked for 3 days this is so irritating end this policy!,1
"I made an account and now it won't let me login. It's asking for all the things I've already done and when I repeat it, still doesn't work.",1
I had to reset my password in Instagram.. and when I tried to login again through my phone the app is just showing black screen.. I'm really worried because I had created my work portfolio in Instagram and now I'm not able to open it back.. I tried everything.. like reset.. uninstall and install again refresh but no use..,1
"It randomly locked me out one day and has not let me back in. I wasnt disabled or blocked or anything that I an aware of. And there is no contact form, email or phone number online that I can find. The only thing is the help center which is useless.",1
"It all started with a lag I tried my best to fix it I cleared data I cleard cache and now I could'nt log in my acc its always ""error""",1
"Hi insta team, Mobile number OTP is not verified. Iam unable to login. Kindly fix the issue team",1
While some one text me in Instagram I'm unable to reply that perticular massage there is no draging option.its just showing like or unsend massage.,1
"When I try to open and check the app, my account was locked, for no reason and now I cannot connect. This is democracy? I think not",1
Won't let me delete some of my highlights. They kept coming back. Pretty frustrating too that they no longer apply the 60 second story.,1
"I haven't been receiving messages in full for almost 3 months now! (And, no, its not because nobody is messaging me.) It shows up on the notification bar that someone's messaged, but when I click on it, the chat log is blank! I've tried uninstalling it, turning my device on and off, clearing all data from Instagram, and NOTHING has worked. It's gotten especially bad now, as Im typing this up, Instagram won't even open! I can only assume it's some kind of a faulty update, please try to fix this.",1
"Very poor... The app is not opening in my device it just shows blank white page. Have tried reinstalling, clearing cache, created support but no solutions are found from their side.",1
"Pathetic editing for reels, the audio never syncs, and clicking on a clip continues the audio instead of replaying for that clip. Frustrating.",1
My account with thousand memories suddenly missing (not found) and support system of Instagram is unreliable. Stupid,1
After meta take over on instagram this app has got lots of bugs to correct the app isn't working properly login issues with lots of bugs in it. Don't know how come these glitches aren't fixed yet it's been 2 months I'm waiting for these errors to get rectified but instagram team has failed,1
I am using Instagram since 2018. Today it asked me for otp. I get the otps on mail and also on number. Still it doesnt work. Can solve this issue @Instagramteam,1
It was all going well until one day it just stopped everytime I try to open it says Instagram is stopped I deleted it and redownload it but nothing it's just not working anymore I really liked it but I hope you solve this problem cause it's so annoying,1
"Worst application, i reported in help center many times that I'm not getting my messenger update. My dm is old, no nee features of reactions or replying to the texts. Even after reporting many times nothing has changed. Worst app ever, they didn't resolve the queries.",1
To many adds in-between every story. Used to love going through everyone's story's but now not so much. I understand you need to make money but multiple adds between every story is ridiculous!,1
I am so disappointed that it doesn't so or doesn't download any videos of the real it's look like why we use Instagram . it doesn't show the notification on real time on this app this ny 4th review . are they kidding me . I couldn't save my reel in my gallery. Why! If I am not able to download other videos but why I can't download my videos why üò° worst app I ever seen üò§,1
Instagram isn't working well Direct chats disappearing mostly in evenings Message notification is getting late Viewed stories shown again and again,1
You don't deserve a single Star. Pls replace Instagram with troublegram maybe while coding your employees are High ü§´ pls release some stable update and fix bugs,1
So bad.poor app. Don't work..the videos only run 5 sec and then stops..so poor.,1
No it's not good. It used to run perfectly but now this doesn't run on low end devices bro zukerberg should make this app more optimised,1
There are many glitches in the app and the app is not working properly and the update in the chat box and all is updated very late and it's not supporting in my phone so I please request you to work on it and make better update. Thank you,1
"Don't know what's up with Instagram since some time..Its been getting regular bugs with no fixes since months..Has a lot of problems with comment section and comments disappearing.. Doesn't remove your accounts username from loged in accounts permanently even after giving remove..Problems With Chat box,sometimes media in your chat list with friends disappear..Instagram before nearly a year was totally alright and clean but now it has lots of probs",1
I can't open this application I've tried many times Whenever I try to open 'It crash',1
I cleaned up my account and I can't login now. It's telling me that my account was compromised. This sucks. üëéüèº Uninstalled at 4k followers.,1
"I can't open the Instagram app for some reason, like it crashes and gives up when it gets to the loading screen. Fix this and I'll change my review, you're rich enough Mark Suckerberg!",1
"I've been trying to post pics in my stories but after posting, the colours of my pic become darker making the pic look trashy. Why do the colours change after posting story??? Please fix this it's very annoying.",1
"Can't stand the new layout.. Almost impossible to read the captions now that it comes up in white font on top of the image... and pretty much everything else they've changed about it too, makes it harder to use Not sure who tested it and actually thought it was a better experience than before, but I'm telling you it ain't! ..And I can't see any way to change it back to the old format.",1
"The most miserable app i have ever got.... This app have have lots of bugs than a game... This most terriifing experience you will get when you will try to do a reel on a musicüò§üò§üò§ this instagram is getting terrible day by day... If you also try to contact for help in instagram, they will ignore you as you are the culprit of the worldüò§(Disrespect behaviour you will ever see). Don't download it until they fix bugs and problems happening on instagramüò§",1
New update sucks. Can't adjust songs and it makes videos all glitchy.,1
"Many problems are present in the app ., expecially bugs",1
"This isnt the same old instagram which everyone used to use! ‚Ä¢Ads and Ads , everywhere, after every 1 story swipe after every 2 posts below ‚Ä¢you never know when their server goes down,it happens very often nowadays on 4th Oct night (IST) It was off for 8+hours Well done instagram! ‚Ä¢they randomly started deactivating and removing account's without telling you your mistake or telling you if its a error from their side!",1
I'm really disappointed in the app. In my first acc it got hacked and deleted. Then in my 2nd acc it happened again. Now in my 3rd acc it's just straight up worse. You would always give me a community guidelines for absolutely nothing and it's just really stupid. And then yesterday while I was in dms Instagram kicked me out and I was unabled to go back because all it shows was a white screen. So I had to chat in discord again. What's even worse today. Same problem. Pls fix this.,1
"UTTERLY FRUSTRATED!! It's been week since I have this problem. I try to post a Story with a photo and wait until it uploads. Then, I checked it, and the my Story has nothing but black or empty background. Like no picture at all. I tried sever methods but nothing work. I was expecting this issue fixed on the current update, but still the same. Please help.",1
I used to be able to open this app and see my friends pics/vids...now i only see like 2 pics and 50 vids from people i dnt know or care about.. all i do now is log on check some stories from my friends and get off.. went from using this app most of the day.. to now using it like 30 mins a day tops... I have no interest in a random persons video that just copied someone elses video... I stopped usiing fb long ago.. guess ig will be next real soon,1
"Terrible, I can not open my Instagram account I have updated it but nothing is working.",1
"Notifications come minutes after, the mssgs when u send gets delivered at different time. Worst of all.. from the past two days I'm trying to open the freaking app...IT'S JUST WOULDN'T OPEN!!!! I already tried reinstalling it like twice..and it still wouldn't work. Then the insta call is the worst thing ever. Even if u disconnected the call...the call continues. The microphone will be in use. Even tho the audio of the other person won't be audible. To disconnect, Uninstall and reinstall is solüôÑ",1
"What is up with the app, my photos in my album aren't showing up when I try to go to my album to post them. Only one photo is showing up? And when I click 'other' the pictures show up and it only let's me select one photo",1
"it's not working in my android tablet and I have updated app many times , still the reaction on msg facilities isn't there for my id",1
I don't understand the problem. I think it's from last update app is not working as before.whenever try to open its not going through .only blank screen with Instagram logo.its terribly annoying ..,1
I use this app from recent 6-7 months and I have 3000 followers but suddenly on 17/1/2023 the account get compromised please make a solution of it,1
Literally unusable on Android. Doesn't even load log in page. Just a blank screen when I open the app. Uninstalled 3 times w no luck. Absolutely ridiculous.,1
My mobile data is not working on my account so I can't even report for it. Please solve this problem,1
It's rediculous that this company does not have customer support. You automate account recovery but there's no way for me to explain to you the bugs that i'm facing. I'm not getting the 6 digit code via email like the app says.,1
I love this app but they don't show me all languages song they can only show me English song solve the problem please,1
The new display and scrolling is awful and unusable. There was nothing wrong with the previous display and smooth scrolling down through posts on the homepage but the latest update has made it clunky and not user friendly at all. If this was designed to make people spend more time on the app then it will have the exact opposite effect as I'm sure people will be avoiding it now! Just awful.,1
"Last few updates have totally destroyed the app, all videos freeze frame and the audio keeps playing. Every. Single. one. They turned photos into 1 second video reels that auto scroll for God knows what reason. Its ridiculous and it straight up doesn't make sense. You can't scroll for more then 60 seconds without running into a problem or having sponsored content that isn't relevant shoved down your throat. If I could delete the app and still have regular contact with people & memes I would. 0/5",1
"Messaging doesn't work. Even though I get notifications for new DMs popping up, they don't show up when I open the app and go to my inbox.",1
This is bad I can't even create account on Instagram telling can't complete your request now & and wait for a few minutes before you complete you try again that's not good at all,1
"I thought after update, uninstall, clear data, clear cache it will resolve issues but no. I don't get any option for save reels,it only give option is draw. plz fix this problem üôè As soon as possible plz_.",1
Even if my font size is big or screen display is on large ot cuts out some of the wordings or designs. It's like u can't read all of it or see like it's too close or something please fix,1
"Instagram is one of the most used social media apps in the world. However there are a lot of bugs while using it. Some of them are: 1) When a voice message is sent, it gets converted into a shared post format and a message appears, ""Post unavailable"". The message converts back to audio format only when DM list is refreshed. 2) While loging in, a message is displayed. ""The username does not belong to any account...""; even if the username and password are entered correctly. kindly look to it",1
Didn't like the new upgraded version... I am not able to reply oru send emojis to particular texts..üôÉ And I'm not able to check the reels I've shared üòí‚òπÔ∏è I was really fine before this upgrade....,1
"The screen appears to be blank and on scrolling it's used to showing that ""couldn't refresh feed"" this problem is showing continuosly....please fix it as soon as possible..",1
fine until literally today. the new update where you have to click to see all story posts is annoying. every time I try to view my own story the app crashes. there was nothing wrong with how stories were before.,1
It used to be nice but my messenger feature is still not updated.. I can't reply to specific msg and also can't react.. I can only like. It is really hard to chat in insta. I reported it so many times but no reply. It's kinda making me hate insta :(,1
"Notifications often come late and most of the time it doesn't even work. And in the past 2 days instagram won't even load up. It's constantly glitching out. Messages won't send, videos and stories won't load and it couldn't even refresh the feed. I cleared the cache, doesnt work. Cleared all data, doesn't work. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, it still doesn't fix the issue. Before putting out updates make sure to amend ALL previous issues and bugs to ensure the app works AS INTENDED.",1
"Instagram has shadowbanned my professional business page. My hashtags are not showing up in their respective locations, I am getting no new engagement from non-followers, and my posts are barely being pushed to people who regularly like my art. They have not accepted any of my pleas, and I'm taking a big hit on my outreach and sales because of them. I hate Instagram and their stupid little algorithm/game that you have to play into. Instagram sucks.",1
"Sick of opening this app to literal porn 9/10 times. I just want memes and posts from people I follow. I've reported the porn more than 60 times. Of the 16 closed report tickets, none of them dealt with the issue. Absolutely USELESS reporting system, absolutely broken algorithm.",1
I'm having trouble with instagram app as its automatically skipping stories. However it doesn't skip the videos though. I reinstalled the app but the issue is still there.,1
It social media but I am not able to use anything if anything wrong happening that I can oppose against it. Just it is wasting time to look only glamour and getting trap in scammers. Immediately I am getting block or my profile will be bann. Thats very bad impact in my emotions so I am avoiding to use Instagram and advice everyone to not use any of this social media.,1
"Every update makes it even worse. I can't even use my phone while on ig call anymore. Reels are awful, pictures don't load. When you post it changes the format of it and I can't even send people posts",1
When using this app The videos doesnt play or load because the volume is on but when the volume is off it does play... awkward right. What's the problem here? How can I get it fix?,1
"I was enjoying this app but when i started an account . Instagram suspended my account for abosulety no reason which is ridiculous for me because I didn't do anything wrong Today it happened again ,I'm honestly tired of such happening. I don't post anything thats inappropriate nor going against their community guidelines. When I also tried opening an account ,it keeps saying ""wait a few minutes before uu could try again "" when entering a username.",1
"The application won't work properly since yesterday, The page is not load properly and I can't able to see any stories and post as well. Please figure it out.",1
Dear Instagram team I have a problem for a long time I haven't got reply and more reaction option i hope you understand the problem so I requested you please provide the swipe reply and more reaction option in few days thanku and I also requested to you upload a new version on Play Store. To help us all and ouurr problem solve thanku very much,1
The earlier version was much better than the new one. The online option where we can see who's online being removed is something you guy's should get it back. Notes option nobody cares about it cause it's just dumb.,1
Instagram is running very down for a few days and no surfing is happening. It is not scrolling properly. They are taking a lot of time even after installing. Installing and then surfing not working properly,1
The current experience with Instagram was very poor nothing was work lags so much nd the stories doesn't able to see also the service I have seen was very slow as see the review section no one gets the reply back,1
i don't know what the hell wrong with this Instagram recently after updating so many bugs and stuff unecessarily and now it's upside down it's really stuck everytime i open the app Don't know what's so special update version is there and after allowing tagging everyone can tag me on post reels no one can tag me disgusting app everytime i open my account it's say you've been log out of your account after updating it's more annoying and disgusting as before soon it's going to tata bye bye Insta,1
Y'all better change the new feature because i can't load my old pictures in the file media section and tons of it has just disappeared to a reduced amount. I DONT WANT THAT,1
"Absolutely appalling app. No option to turn off auto play, will suck your data dry. Save yourself the pain use Chrome shortcut. Avoid.",1

"Instagram India is now hindufobic in India , instgram deleting Hindu IDs and pages without any reason and on the other hand it doesn't take any action on islamik or leftist and Christian hate speech post or pages on Instagram, this is clearly partiality it shows that instgram is against Hindus and India . üò°üò°üò°üò° Instagram management should resolve this as soon as possible, otherwise we will protests against instgram worldwide.",1
Ngl this has to be the worst and most boring social media app. I'm satisfied with my life and don't care to look at other people's more boring lives. I wouldn't recommend this unless thats what you're into. It wouldn't even let me delete my account either.,1
I am facing issues with my account as my messenger is not of the latest version. I cannot reply to specific messages on instagram. I have reported this through email but it didn't help. Very dissatisfied.,1
Very bad app often closing and I've to open it again and again to use it. While scrolling it suddenly come back that's very irritating.,1
Very Ridiculous app it is. They Suspended my id without any reason. And after this for reporting for verification process they have to send the code but until they did not send me. How inappropriate it was !!,1
Msg gets automatically delete if I have not deleted and active status is not showing of anyone if someone sends and msg it also gets disappears automatically from both the sides even I have 2 to 3 times uninstalled and install again and again then also this issue as been not solved,1
"So, so many bugs. Upload a photo, filter it, press ok button, kicks me off app and then doesn't save it. FIX.IT.",1

Bug list bug 1 : Trying to search for an audio for reel and application got crashed. bug 2 : 30/10/2022 - Selected instagram reels audio is being changed to original audio after posting,1
"Nothing's been loading for the past month or so. As oh this of this week, every post is blurred out, and the reels are completely black.",1
"I wanted to login my account after many months, but I can't login no matter how much I tried. Please fix this. On website version of Instagram, whenever I try to request reset passwors link, it only says feedback_required.",1
"Glitches horribly , this app is so cool but when u want to post it glitches, does not show the pictures at all and basically u can not post anything unless u have a really good phone .",1
When I try to change from my different IG accounts it takes wayyyy too long to log me off. I had to continuesly Uninstall IG and reinstall it to be able to switch to my other account. This is very frustrating. Never had this issue prior.,1
I have instagram since 2011 and this app is getting worst and worst day by day. Now I can't even choose one song to put in the storys because it says that all the popular musics don't exist. Please fix this.,1
With every upgrade they go backwards now we have to be on our computer to be able to add things to our shop??! so you're telling me I had to wait until I get home to add something to my shop when I just took a picture on the go... It's like they forget how to be user friendly everyday.,1
"I keep getting signed out on all my devices and my laptop browser as well, this is beyond messed up. I sign into one and I get signed out of the others. Fix this nonsense. Before this it was working great.",1
"Bugger. Cannot pause the video. All vid are auto play. Even simple action like ""zooming"" not available. No track control at video.",1
Instagram isn't answering to my reports ! Why don't I have a reel section after downloading it? And where is pronouns? My stories got deleted without any reason . Instagram isn't helpful at all. There's no response. Every time there's a bug big issue,1
"I was logged out of my account. I have 2 factor authentication on, keep that in mind. I have access to my email connected to my account, access to my phone number, yk. I have videos which show MY FACE, but I get emailed back which states 'Your information could not be confirmed.' I have the proof (Deleted pictures specifically) that I am the owner of this acount. Please make more available options that allow us to speak with employees. This account has all my memories, I cannot lose it.",1
"Instagram is about to become completely useless. Explicit content without any justification; foolish recommendations that I truly did not signed for. What does it all mean? Basically, using this app any more is utter nonsense.",1
"No customer support. I am facing issue with post boosting. I have asked for support a month back. And I am getting the feedback. They are looking. Due to this I cannot boots my post, add any ads",1
"It's been a month now I can't post any reel from draft, can't post story, it get vanished, my 7 reels got vanished, i don't know where it went... I have raised complain also, but it has not resolved.. followers count getting decreased suddenly also",1
The Stories of others are getting skipped automatically without even touching the screen seems like a bug which have to be taken seriously.,1
I strongly dislike the algorithm. I want to see all posts from the people I follow and I want to see them in chronological order. The new update is also very annoying. I want to see older posts again without having to see that huge checkmark and clicking a button. Why would I want to see suggested posts. That's what the explore page is for. I follow people because I want to see THEIR posts. It also glitches all the time ://,1
The app is lagging alot and glitches while recording or when i want to post something (doesn't let me tagg)I have the app on dark mode and as soon as I watch a video the whole screen turns white.. I also noticed I'm following random people I never noticed and I can't unfollow,1
It was better before but recently it has lots of glitches.. and when I'm mentioning people in my story they are not mentioned only 2 or 3 people can be mentioned they are showing in story name but they are not mentioned üòë.. really unsatisfied üòê,1
Thumb nails are often wrong on the app. You idiots have also moved things that were placed perfectly fine on desktop. Do something useful like a darkmode for desktop. I swear this app has circling the toilet ever since Facebook bought out it,1
"I would give it 0 stars if I could. Deleted the app, redownloaded it MULTIPLE times, won't show me anything other than a black screen. I can log in on a web browser but the app sucks.",1
If you are running an app Like instagram it's your responsibility to keep this app bugs and glitches free but there are way too much bugs and glitches in this app. This is Not Acceptable. Please bring a new update and fix all this bugs asap!,1
"Dear Instagram team , I don't get the point that why the messenger icon is not showing in my Instagram app. I checked in settings also but there is no option to update messaging . please provide me a solution in order to not shake my interest from this app.",1
My account has been hacked. At the moment the recovery instructions in the instagram application are outdated. The hacker has activated 2 steps authentication on my account and I can't recover it. I can't find any suport email. Nice...,1
"It's been a year that I'm complaining about my problem and yet I'm getting zero results.. My instagram messenger isn't working and I can't change the theme, I can't like the messages with different emojis and I can't reply a particular message.. There is a minimum 1 star rating.. But If I could, I gave u negative ratingü§¨üò°",1
Crashes every now and then. Too many bugs. What is the point in having this kind of an app which i m not able to use for more than a minute. Solve this bugüë∫,1
You type in one person and you get 20 versions of that person it's out of control yet you let it go on probably because all that fakeness creates commerce for you!. Example if I comment on a blue icon person all of a sudden somebody wants to follow me claiming that it is the blue icon person and it's their private page or they claim it to be their fans private page so they can communicate with the fan base on this is why we need voter ID because like there people can just be someone else,1
"Never fixed, just gets worse. Every update seems to have made the app work less and less. Absolutely ridiculous to go from a working product to just trash.",1
Got hacked and had the email and everything changed on my account with no way of getting it back..! Absolutely fumming and disgusted. Have deleted the app and will Not be redownloading it ever again. Ignored at at every avenue.,1
"It's a great app but genuinely the new update of notes are also good but, i have 2 accounts and it's not showing on the other account while my activity status is opened and still it's not showing on the other account please fix it",1
Can't save stories after they get posted even when the feature of automatically saving stories is turned on. My ads are in appaeal from the last 20 days. Pathetic response,1
"Very bad services, i have a glitch in my account and i habe reported it so many times but nothing was done. It's been an year with that glitch. Very very bad customer service.",1
"So many glitches Example Network problem Post late Send late msg Show msg late Anytime it get turn off After blocking the people they are able to see our story and can msg us Always showing failed , try again Some times I can't log in into my I'd So your password is wrong I changed my password now 5th time for this only ü§¨ Pls developer I am requesting you to solve these problems because I like instagram so much and i have been using it since 1 year now!",1
"I couldn't use the app until I updated it and after the latest update, I cannot open any links from a profile or a story. Very irritating",1
Except Instagram all my apps are running on my data... Why is it glitching so much?! Please fix this glitch it's annoying... I'm not supposed to uninstall and install the app everytime to just open it?!,1
Instagram app is not refreshing for me. I don't know what's going on! It's been several weeks. I've tried re-installing it several times. Help!,1
"This app does not let me tag anyone, it keeps on saying tell us more about the error...reached out to Instagram several time yet not resolved. It's not an app for Photographers anymore..",1

And there service to customers is so poor i have sent them i think 4 time but reply till now. Dont use this app. I will give them -0 rating .,1
I reported the same problem a several times but no one did anything.....on my Instagram add back to your story option is not available after someone mentions me ......I kindly request you to solve this asap.,1
When I watch someone's story it skips everything and goes to the next one and does it again for the next stories. Please fix this issue.,1
Experience is not good it takes soo time to upload a reel and it's have soo many glitches like it's always show one reel in my every reel and i m not able to delete my reels also,1
They really need to start cracking down on inappropriate content I follow a lot of meme pages and I can't even open my phone without seeing a naked woman in fishnets. I've been unfollowing and reporting them and it's still a ridiculous amount,1
"its become a tic toc wannabe,if i was looking for a video streaming platform it wouldn't be anything by meta or facebook or whatever shady name change is in effect.like facebook its time to delete this tired old app,its time is past and doesnt even resemble instagram",1
Instagram on web won't save adjustments to multiple photos. Only one photo is adjusted and rest are returned to default adjustments... O bog te jebo isus krist mrtvi. Jebo vas bog,1
Horrible app and usability is for people who don't want to edit pictures. And deletes drafts.,1
Too many ads to be bothered using insta anymore. Tiktok's better cause it's easier to flick past the stupid ads without seeing them.,1
"I think someone hacked my Instagram account , I can't use it perfectly, they showing me some glicths like auto restrickting my friends I'd , auto log out and also buffering . Plzz help me üò≠ and check that whose using or hacking my I'd. Please reply me so I can share my Instagram I'd for their checkup . And also Block the hacker's IP address.",1
My account has been hacked and there is no way to verify that account its mine. Selfie video option is USELESS. I keep getting email from Instagram that they weren't able to verify my identity üòí Bullocks!,1
The music option is suddenly out for my post and there is not help or feedback from instagram this is such a worst experience a user could get....,1
"Worst app This app is not allowed me to enter in my insta account üòÇüòÇüòÇ 1.Log in with Facebook option not working properly 2.Log in with email id ( if the email id was deleted or change then what will do insta for their users to recover account 3.most intresting thing ( insta one option is you can log in with your past device I'm trying this one also but result ""0"" 4.now i feel like why am I created account on this app Need to remove this app from playstore",1
I am so annoyed with this app. It automatically skips the story. Like I couldn't see some of the stories. What the hell is going on with this app. So irritated,1
"My other account was hacked over 2 weeks ago. I did the video selfie, it didn't work, I filled up the impersonation form, didn't get an answer, I emailed, no answer and I've been doing this every single day for the past 15 days and nothing!! This is ridiculous!!",1
Very poor experience right now so many things are not there like music save options.showing same profiles in search option.,1
Not sure what's going on but stories are impossible to view. They're there for literally a second before rushing through to whatever is next.,1
"Very glitchy, stories only show for 0.25 seconds. Tons of issues that never get fixed. Clearly Zuckerberg and developers have stopped caring",1
Doesn't work when I click on links in people's stories just keep getting an error message with facebook icon?? Deleted and reinstalled but still having the same problem,1
"Stories now skip on their own, but ads do not. Terrible update. The auto scroll on posts is VERY annoying. Uninstalled.",1
I am facing a very dissatisfying bug as I am not able to reply any message Please resolve this issue. I had already complained 2 times but it was not resolve please resolve it as soon as possible.,1

"Besides the hundreds of bugs this app ALREADY has, it's now started suspending accounts with no reason around October 16th and none of us have gotten back our accounts despite multiple online news articles being posted. You'd think for such a good app theyd have a better system.",1
I am unable to post any reel or any photos on my story whenever I do so it shows a green screen after being posted .There is always a problem in this app .,1
"Didn't have many issues till I went to update and acts like it is going to the just wants me to keep deleting stuff to make room after It shows 100% .... I'm not able to post anything I get a ""unable to load image""",1
"When open the app, the first new post at glimpse will be suddenly ""refresh"" away and forcing me to slide down many times till I reach the post. This is very annoying. Please fix this behaviour",1
"The annoyed thing is that, everytime when you're update this App data is very used but it also has not limited data or Data save. So it's cost to used too much data so as to do it's work.",1

"I am constantly bothered to spend money on boosting posts, but for some undisclosed reason, I can't list products on Instagram. Sounds dumb, right? Let me list products, THEN, AND ONLY THEN, will I spend money on advertising.",1
Fix your stories issues. It skips past the stories of the people I follow when I click on them and it takes me directly to ads and then again when I tap next,1
This Instagram is more complex and it has also many error especially network error.I can't post on it and I can't find filters as first.,1

"It's not that good of a app like it use to be and they should add a feature where the people who unfollowed you , you unfollow them back. I been wanting to uninstall this for a while and finally did.",1
Locked out of account by instagram for security breach. Zero way to contact anyone. Face recognition does not work when it's clearly me. Meta uses this tactic to create a higher user base. I am short $META,1
Latest update has a bug when viewing stories. Random stories are unviewable and the app will skip over them to the next available story. I'm on Android 13 on a pixel 4a,1
"I can't login into my Facebook as well as Instagram account as it has been Disabled. Day before yesterday, I saw one sponsored story on Instagram about the game BGMI. There they were giving free rewards by just login in the facebook details. But after submitting the login information I got to know that the website was a phishing scam.

Not so good with freedom of speech. Keep popping up fact checking banners about things that have been main stream science the 5 decades,1
"It is a very unusual application, that app give us 0.1% knowledge and update about surrounding and rest 99.9% , give very bad effects on present generation, also distract from study and many more things, etc. I want to give 0 rating to this application but that is not in option so I give 1 rating.",1
Instagram not showing my most recent photos for me to post. Tried everything and the best i could get is selecting other media and upload just one photo at a time. Please fix!,1
"Don't bother trying to adjust a photo when editing (zoom, straighten, vertical or horizontal rotate) the app will just post it the original way...or leave wide black gaps on the sides of the photo when posting multiples at a time or white lines on the top and bottom. Posting multiples will also usually mean that a few in the group will be slashed or jumbled and unclear",1
I been locked out of my account no warning no text no email and I can't recover my Instagram account nor contact customer support to let them know something wrong,1
every update meta releases a new bug is discoverd you can see how much bugs there are by using the app for an hour (to be specific my phone is oppo reno 5f),1
The latest update made it so I cant access half of my photos to post? Like what? It was worming fine until about a week ago.. I can no longer even find the photos I want to post from Instagram even though they're in my gallery on my phone..,1
I am unable to update Instagram since few days that are bothering me to enjoying the features of Instagram please fix it soon.,1

To top it of so called white hat hackers approached me to recover account.",1
"Just when it couldn't get worse, it got extra worse with the latest update. There's now an all tab in messaging which has no reason being there. It's the first tab too and the default one. I'm sure these guys sit round a table daily brainstorming how much more to butcher this app.",1
These fkers think they are some hotshot and don't even provide deactivate account option in their app which used to be there. Now you have to login in a browser and then do the deed and on top of that they keep stupid terms even when I want to deactivate my account and even show me a guide how to uninstall like they're literally mocking people now. Worst user experience ever. Only the people there is the reason this is still going else the support and UI/UX really sucks. Fk meta fk Zucker,1
I have updated so many times but still my instagram account has not be update why .... I cant react to the messages neither i can like the stories,1
"this year with instagram i had soo many bugs, the app doesnt open, the messages in notification were seenable but in app they werent",1
This app has gotten worse and worse. I get notifications that there's a message but the message doesn't show. Can't scroll left or right to see the images from the save post. It's been glitchy. My family can't even find me on Instagram while others have no problem. The bugs really need to be fixed,1
It's good but there should be option for saving video along with the music üé∂,1
In this app so Many time problem of mention. if i mention some one that person can't be mention in that video,1
Filled with bugs that annoy me all the time. You can't type in your stories. The keyboard just pops up and goes down if you close and open through recent tabs. Some times I can't hear any sound in stories for the same reason. While texting the send button disappears. Even after years I face a lot of bugs daily. Worst ever updates. Also I can't watch some reels fully it goes blank in the middle. No matter what you do never plays fully. Nothing changes even if u r upto dateüëéüëé,1
"Please get back to the previous post layout version. This is ridiculous, it's like TikTok or reels menu all over now. Those new posts look and scroll really really bad. And why would you put Save into that three dots menu, so annoying. And also, I think it happened earlier, but why did you remove story pause. When I'm doing smth, or read long text, or just wanna stop, it's so convenient. Or it was. You're making the app worse and worse, really.",1
"My experience is not good whenever I use insta it glitches and turn off itself I don't get any message as if I have a problem in my phone or Instagram, most of the times my account gets problem and because of that I am not able to like posts and right now I can't even use this app because its not opening",1
Haven't been able to post pics for a couple of weeks. Will not locate all my photos in my gallery. Just downloaded most recent update. Still not working.,1
Some time. App. Was not. Working. Video call was. Hanging please solve the problems,1
App is very worst always bug reporting but no action taken from last two years.always getting problem in download your own videos after filter and after posting videos No message or call from app helpdesk after reported.dialoma where to report. There is no minimum responsibility from app.after posting like this I am unable to make and post new videos. Only old videos are allowed to post me. So here only paid account videos are popular,1
Can't even look at stories without an ad after every story. Killing Instagram Now all my stories are getting deleted after posting,1
Trying to post a story crashes the application. Trying to post a reel crashes the application. This app is very inconsistent when it comes to posting content. sometimes it works sometimes it does not that should not be the case. Creating content on your platform should not be this much of a pain. Your user should not expect to have to uninstall reinstall the app or restart their router every single time they want to post a reel and this has been happening to me consistently in my experience.,1
I randomly got logged out of my account so I tried logging back in then it said something about a challenge and it wanted a 6 digit code but you guys aren't sending the code and now I can't login to my account,1
Stories always stuck at loading and app crashes when trying to post a reel. Have to uninstall and reinstall app just for it to work for a month.,1
"Idk why but my Instagram is not opening up ..what all i see is only a blank black screen...i am so done with this ....i have tried every possible way be it uninstalling or installing the app, updating the app, switching off the phone and all...kindly do something in this reference.",1
"If you are logged out and you have two factor authentication, forget that you will ever be logging in, i have my mail n mobile number, not Receiving code on my number and back up codes, do not work, and after uploading the video selfie, they send a back up code, that doesn't work either, unable to contact anyone as there is no live support for thia huge company, so now it seems like i have lost my account forever.",1
The most recent update doesn't allow multiple pictures to be uploaded. Just one at a time. üòë It's tedious and time consuming. Will most likely stop using the app.,1
Doom scrolling app. Why can't you add music to stories? Reelz are dumb.,1
"When I do editing on reels using photos, It can't even put timing for the text.... just can animate which is quite frustrating, and the editing stucked a lot like when I already make a good video which really fit the audio movement, but when I'm on preview panel the vid ran away from audio... it's super frustrating and I pissed off a lot... can you guys please make it easier to edit a video or just go back to the old time when Insta is just a Photo sharing app... Thank you...",1
"Full of scam pages, bots, and distractions from real world issues and personal life. In the last 5 years this app as well as other social media platforms has become a poison to our society. One star for tainting an entire generation of kids minds and attention.",1
Getting worse day by day after updating the features changed into old version... Updating is for get new version or to ge old versions ?.. chages this glitches frst .,1
"I'm not on Instagram that often, just to read whatever my friends send me on Facebook. Now it wants my phone number to login. Nope not getting it.",1
"What did you do with the uploading? I can't figure it out but it only let's me upload one image instead of multiple, and every other option to upload just SHOWS ME WHAT IVE ALREADY UPLOADED. Idk what you guys did but you messed up. Absolutely terrible.",1
"If we want short form videos, we'd go to tiktok. We do you push people to watch what you recommend even if they are not interested? What's the purpose of having people we follow if some random, unknown human being that am not even interested in keeps on showing in my newsfeed simply because you keep on suggesting them?",1
Getting realy worst day by day once i lost my account now its complete bugs Issues likes messages getting after one or 2 days . No response from support team also,1
Unable to upload high quality photos and videos. The app downgrades.,1
"Your post editing feature is soooo glitchy, that's unbelievable. Sometimes I like to change a brightness, saturation etc even on a picture I've previously edited, but messes up with it. And when I've selected multiple pictures and I edit only one of them, the rest are replaced with duplicates of it. Ridiculous! And make option to turn off the reels! They are annoying!",1
It keeps feeding me ads from companies that I have blocked because I don't want to buy their rubbish. Also seem to get a lot of scam ads promoting fake casino apps that totally promise to pay out. Report them and two weeks later they get back to you.,1
"It's becaming full of vulgarity platform,this is all our new generation can learn from it . . . You should allow olny informative & knowledgeable video's",1
What is this rubbish new update my boomerang saved drafts are lost. There should be a notification also when anyone unfollows.,1
"Was okay but is now glitchy and crashes often, way too many adverts.",1
I just opened instagram today and then I found my whole inbox is empty except only one chat. I was amazed and shocked so I tried everything to recover everything but still it doesn't work. What an pathetic experience. I want the solution ASAP.,1
"There is a lot of bugs , specially chat replies option and chat emoji reaction option not showing.",1
"hey Instagram I'm facing an issue with my Instagram application. Whenever I try to open an Instagram application it's fully covered by a white/ black screen. so, resolve my problem as soon as possible. I hope you will resolve this problem with my Instagram application. thank you..",1
I have submitted my report many times. But instagram is not resolving my issue.,1
"Everything is good and the reels also, but the dms have issues. When I am chatting with a girl which is kinda important and I'm not getting any notifications for her messages. Please fix this issue or i will be single forever and this will be all Insta's fault.",1
Why quality of reel got decreased after posting the video....plsss solve the problem plus Now I don't get link of reel also nor can save the video because some of the videos get muted after downloading...bad experience,1
I am not able to create a new highlight from my profile. I reported it multiple times from many days. I added a highlight through my story but the new highlight got deleted automatically. Fix this asap,1
My Instagram account not updated no reply with emojis I am facing problem with messaging updated please resolve it as soon as possible,1
Worst app not able to send reels to friends and no sound in story and no emoji reaction available So many bugs this app is getting worst,1
"App stopped working. Restarted the phone, cleared cache, cleared data, reinstalled and after all that, I open the app and a black screen appears instead of the login page. Haven't been able to use the app for a week now. Can't believe it takes a tech giant so long to fix a bug that's been present for a couple of weeks now!",1
Quality of pic gets reduced to few kb for original pic of sizes 3-6MB. Same goes for videos. Pictures could not be seen in full screen nor can you zoom them. Reddit is super awesome in these terms. In insta messenger you cannot select specific sent or received messages to delete those specific messages alone. Have to delete the whole chat. There are many flaws in IG and I wonder if it is a top app only because celebs are here. It should not be a well known app for its features for sure.,1
It's a great app but filters aren't working,1
Fix your captioning problems. Its not good that you can only caption if its a photo.,1
"Horrendous customer service, being on this app makes me feel so unprotected! After months of trying to get my account that was hacked unbanned and sending multiple emails with my face for proof of identity- I got completely ignored with absolutely nothing I could do. Instagram doesn't care about its users.",1
Sub optimal... if you are looking to build a online presence don't do it here thair is little to no support so if you get hacked chances are you won't get your account back. all the time you invest will be gone and so will the credibility of the branding . If you are looking to build a brand do it somewhere with actual support for your investment in time and money .,1
Such a worst experience I'm unable to add close friend list and I'm unable to see my close friend list resolve it,1
"I use it on a daily basis and it's the only place I can post my art freely . But out of no where , everytime I open the app it just stays in a black screen and does nothing . I'm really hoping you fix this bc like I said , it's the only place where I can post my art and have it get noticed . Please fix this !! I've deleted and installed it plenty times , restarted my phone plenty times as well , deleted apps , pictures and videos but nothing is working . Like I said , please fix this problem !",1
"I can't react with emojis other than a heart to someone's DM. I reported the problem as well but, didn't get any response.",1
"Worst app i ever seen ,we can't even upload a video properly ,,, the video is uploading at the end it got stucked , upload stucked ,,,and there is no option to cancel upload ,,, we have to uninstall and again start the app to upload video , now again upload stucked, my data is 2 gb a day , it totally exhausted by single video ,,, the upload size is only 200 to250 mb only",1
Heyii it was all going good bt now i am not getting login code on my number also their is no option available to resend it or else.. not able to login to my own account..,1
i have been struggling to get into my account for more than a week now. i can't even reset my password and my account isn't hacked at all.,1
"Ur app needs a filter. All I get in my feed is violence including shootings even though i strictly follow meme accounts, my friends, bike and car accounts. And all photos i like are vehicles or cute dogs and cats. And i've reported and blicked every account i've seen post violence, yet it keeps showing up every time i open my app. Fix ur app what is actually wrong with you. And don't u dare use an age restriction because it clearly doesn't work",1
"You guys are not giving me messenger icon and i cant reply to messages, also i can't react to messages. I hope you will fix it.",1
What a downward spiral for IG. I want my ad money back. This shoot doesn't download. Absolute junk of 47mb,1
The app is acting weird unable to see the dms where I am getting notifications but the messages are not coming,1
hey app i suggest you don't show your over edited ads because i have very old insta user and your adds are very bothering me and pliz you update your search bar because i was searched my friend id but don't show his id then pliz do something,1
"@instagram please solve this issue. There's a glitch in my app, always. It doesn't even show the notes section in my and the story section also glitches time to time.",1
Story not uploading kindly fix it as soon as possible üôè,1
"When replying to someone i can't see what i'm typing. The amount of bots is obnoxious. And there needs to be an option to turn off instagram reels on the explore page. Also, half of the posts have ads in them for some crappy fast fashion store, this is on top of the standard ads from instagram itself. They're probably not gonna listen to the feedback though, because why fix these things when you can just make money while not changing things for the better.",1
"It has been kicking me out of the app non stop for the last few day, won't let me do anything, text, post, view stories, nothing at all! And it suddenly went back to one of the old versions",1
"Was working correctly but suddenly it banned me for not doing anything wrong, and now i've reinstalled it, it is not even recognizing me, stupid app",1
"For a week I can't put music in my stories again, I can't listen to the music from other people's stories and if they tag me in a story with music I can't repost it",1
"My most favorite social media. I spend a lots of time here. But there's a lots of issues about Instagram. If I wanna post something it's takes forever to process but my wifi is working perfectly. I can't story anything from the app. Even somehow I manage to do it, I don't have that damn music option. I can listen other people'a story music or whatever. Whyyy those are happening?? Just fix this already. I'm really so annoyed. Thank you in advance üò©üíñ",1
"I have the latest updates but it has so many bugs, my story and reels and in fact everything has so many glitches! Please work on it as we are expecting a good UX from such a big organisation",1
My account is not getting the latest update which includes replying to a particular message by swiping it and also I can't react to messages other than liking them. Very disappointed by this coz I reported this problem many times since I started my account and there is no response from the team.,1
The app is not responding. It keeps reloading and has become buggy.,1
"Absolutely terrible!! If I could give it 0 stars I would. Please bring the old instagram back, NOBODY wants to see bunch of trash they didn't even choose to have in their feed. We came on IG to follow people we actually wanted to follow, not to scroll endlesly through a content we didn't want to. You'll never be a TikTok, deal with it.",1
"Updated to newest version, and lost the ability to do custom emoji reactions. ??? Edit: now I need to uninstall/reinstall every few weeks to see videos that people send in DMs. But I guess the ""reels"" are working out for Facebook's business, yeah? ü§¢",1
"Story song lyrics is ALWAYS freezing, i cant post a song for that, quality is so low and instagram low that for some reason",1
After sometime song removed from highlights. And every time when we put new story on highlights it shows at last slide. The recent story should come first.,1
Horrible can't even log in and have been contacting Instagram but nothing is being done.,1
"After update i can't see the reels, and i can't open setting only i can see is buffering",1
"Edit : i just commented on some silly cats photos ""this is so perfect for my profile picture"" and tagged my friend, and then suddenly again i got suspended for commenting, i don't understand :(",1
"Bro, cool it with the ads already. One every three posts is pretty absurd.",1
Not work properly. always showing error while downloading the videos..,1
This app is soo soo cheap because when i open this app it take a minute or sometimes it take a many long Time and when i logout my acc and open it again it takes a very long time üò°üò°,1
Why you guy's gave a sorting option in a follower list it's not working all time and all option gave same result please repair it or remove,1
I updated it many times but I can't upload my story more than 15 seconds. Please solve this issue.,1
From some days whenever I open my play store and open the updates icon always there were 45MB update for Instagram please improve this bug from my Instagram,1
"I lost my first account to hackers. Hackers and scammers are not new, they're over running the app. For any larger account you know there'll be at least 10 scammers pretending to be the OG. If Instagram doesn't fix their problem soon it'll die. (I did video selfie verification twice and got rejected both times. According to Instagram I dont look like myself.)",1
"Servers are down I can't log in with any additional account Or send an email or number tell me please wait a few minutes or there was a problem logging you into instagram. please try again soon, fix it plz",1
Instagram is not working I open in my chrome browser it works properly and when I use Instagram it doesn't play any thing viz.story reels,1
"they ruined the algorithm by adding reels and making it so that instead of having the normal explore page filled with pictures and possible videos you might be interested in,, they put reels in the same place, and you have to hit a different button to get the explore page. reels are also a toxic thing not only because it just copied tik tok (nice one copycat Zuckerberg) but because theres no way to prevent seeing the same ones over and it doesnt show you what you are interested in.",1
Video is not play while watching. only audio is running on background voice.,1
Why you removed the note option after the update. I really hate this and your app isn't working properly,1
"Worst policy ever i had seen. My Instagram account (manishv_02) has been disabled i don't know why it happens to till date i had complaint many times before that my account has been hacked but due to your worst policies of communities and guidelines i am now unable to open my account i had lost it forever, not only this i had also lost my facebook account (loveMe.manish) for doing nothing.",1
"its a good app BUT WHEN I REPPORT AN ACC OR SAY THAT IM NOT INTERESTED OF THAT TYPE OF POST, I DONT WANT IT TO START POPING UP EVERY THIRD POST. PLEASEEEE FIX THIS.",1
I am unable to send Direct Messages(DMs) to my new friends since 2 days. So I request instagram to sort out the problem . The friends have not even blocked me then too the problem seems to be occuring . So please sort out the problem then I will give hjgh ratings. I can't see messages on Instagram,1
"Can't upload reels anymore, the app crashes a lot. The new update is terrible. whenever I finish editing, it always shows error",1
"I couldn't view my own stories in the highlights after several days of posting them. They kept loading like forever! I thought it was my internet connection but the internet just worked fine. Turned out it was the app's problem. I've had this problem since a month ago. I kept uninstalling and reinstalling it, but the same problem occured. Perhaps I shouldn't have to reinstall it anymore üôÇ",1
"When I upload a reel on Instagram, the upload is getting canceled, just saying ""Video can't be posted""....why????",1
"*** Day 23 --- app is still not loading. Blank screen*** App not working for 48 hours and going...restarted, uninstalled and reinstalled, used on WiFi and mobile data, clear the cache...nothing is working and unable to properly get support bc I can't assess the app.",1
There's a huge problem in the app. I cannot even open it . Whenever I do it shows a black screen. I uninstalled reinstalled for the umpteenth time now. Still doesn't work . All other apps are working completely fine which means it's not the problem with phone or anything. I have a page and I can't operate it now which is affecting my professional and business profile. Lite and chrome version are not worth it for my page,1
The worst app ever. Can't even upload or edit pictures. Disappointed.,1
Instagram is trash every time I open and close my Instagram it's the same memes and post from 3 or 6 days ago it will not update new reels,1
I cannot log into my insta and insta keep saying my username does not exist. I will change rating when it's fixed.,1
3 day I'm facing these problems.. can you please fix it... I can't see the catagories of Hastag of following section nd other person who I'm msging won't see the theme i changed ü•≤ can immediately fix this problem ü§ß,1
"Terrible, I can't reply message by sliding it from right to left on my Instagram account .",1
My video I was not getting any views only 1020 100 but my friend getting only 110000 you solve the problem and everything is good,1
I have a problem Swipe reply option is not showing on my instagram account in message sectiom How many times I report but you don't fix it,1
"The last change to the feed layout makes the app even less appealing than before. The picture backgrounds are unnecessary, text is frequently illegible when superimposed on the post, translation function has seemingly disappeared and not seeing comments and likes immediately isn't great either. Not to speak of the fact that it's now impossible to smoothly scroll through the feed and quickly skip past uninteresting posts! Not sure what they were thinking but they're really ruining the app!!",1
App is crashing while opening reels and also i dont have message on reply option.,1
App crashes and closes after a minute.,1
Please bring back the ability to snooze suggested post. Thank you,1
It doesn't give me the option to reply to specific message on Instagram Direct on my Pixel 6 Pro. I could do that on my old Samsung.,1
"I'm unable to get back into my account because ingress error, change review once I get account back!",1
App completely broken !!!! So many bugs I don't know where to start. First I'm not able to get any sound from stories until I play a video on my feet with sound. Second since the past few days the scrolling has been horrendous it's constantly bugging and freezing. Now I realize that I cannot click on any link in the bios or in stories. FIX YOU APP ASAP !!,1
Fix the notification bug. Messages keep arriving 10 mins late after being sent.,1
"Similar theme looking at feedback, unable to see anything other than 'couldn't refresh feed' then blank screen for over a week now. Not sure if I'm blocked, restricted or been hacked? No way to contact anyone for help. So looks like I will lose my account which I've had for years. There should be an email address to contact as the ""help"" page isn't very helpful at all.",1
"I've used Instagram for years. It stopped working about 3 weeks ago. I log in and the page is a blank white page üòî I've deleted, updated, installed and nothing works. No more instagram for me üò≠üò≠",1
From a few time when trying to zoom with fingers on a post it doesn't respond correctly moving aside while it's like trembling. In general too confusing menu functions always added (while the already existing have been moved with no sense) and too choppy story mode function with massive amount of lags on a lot of devices. Archive memories doesn't work to post stories. Video in dm can't be sent everytime,1
"I hear instagram is a big thing. Yet somehow it completely fails at the most basic photo/video functions that you'd expect an app that focuses on photos and video to be able to carry out... (e.g. rotate function). Yes, this can be carried out separetely on your phone, but all of this is the opposite of ""insta"". It's laughable.",1
"Great app. Very helpful for me as a performer trying to build my audience. 2022 edit: Like so many others, I tried to uninstall/reinstall and now it brings me to that screen where the lovely meta symbol pops into view for a second then turns into a total black screen. Not sure when this will be resolved, if ever. RIP instagram",1
"What is this I'm trying to login another account and from 40-45min instagram you are showing me wait for sometime you log in again, plz I'm requesting fix this problem I'm trying from a long time. Instagram plz fix this problem plz This is my request",1
My account handle got hacked. I tried with selfie video procedure and also send lots of email but no response. Can you help me with how to recover my account from scammer.,1
"The app is not working up to the standard. It's been slow for a while now and whenever I try to post a story, Instagram completely shuts off for a while. Also, most times my feed and the searchfeed doesn't refresh by itself upon opening the app, you have to renew the page multiple times to see new content... Not having fun with Instagram at all these days, it used to be a nice portal.",1
Very poor aap many problems in this aap many types of bugs in Instagram,1
"New update is terrible. It's no longer an ongoing feed but each post has its own full screen view which doesn't even fit with the post aspect ratios, just to imitate TikTok. Captions need to be expanded manually and aren't even properly aligned to the bottom. The translation feature seems to be gone and tagged people aren't even shown in the picture anymore. Also, reels suck. Try some original ideas instead of steeling from other social media and getting the features worse everytime.",1
Why am unable to download videos directly from reels .... kindly give me suggestions ..u re changes alot of things.. ... ..,1
"News feed , stories and old messages do not appear anymore after the latest update",1
Swipe to reply option doesn't show up in chat. The function is not working since I started using this app an I am also not able to change chat themes.,1
"It's not working properly! The update is worse than before I can't even saw the pictures on my newsfeed and even the notifications didn't work properly I can't send messages, my internet connection is not the problem here because it's really fast and I can use other apps. I guess the updated version is the app problem. I hope for the latest version because it's much better than this!",1
"I can't make audio calls and also can't repost, and I've updated d app buh still not working",1
Instagram crashed many times . Messages from my friends show everytime i open Instagram wherever i seen it.,1
"New video update is making the UI more complicated than need be. Sound cannot be enabled without going fullscreen, forcing you to leave the feed. Some videos refuse to play due to a recent bug. I worry the app is going in the direction FB is moving, introducing a boatload of new features nobody asked for and unnecessarily complicating the UX in a desperate bid to increase time spent on the app, unaware of the slow cultural shift occuring in the app because of it. Don't fix what isn't broken.",1
"I can't open my instagram account, I have tried everything... I clear the cache and date...Update, reinstall.... Everything has become so annoying! Even when it was working it has many errors.. filters weren't working properly and stories were turned into a black color! I used to like Instagram, but they don't work in order to fix those issues! I'm so mad and disappointed.",1
"Latest version broke collaboration tagging again. This time, you can see the request, but can't accept. The work around is uninstall, reinstall and it will work.. For about a day and any new requests will require to reinstall again.",1
"Absolutely what awful what instagram has turned into, it's so horribly buggy that nothing works, wanna like a post? Doesn't work, wanna open dms? Doesn't work, wanna switch accounts? Doesn't work. Literally everything makes this app crash, opening dms, opening camera, turning down my brightness, watching a video, opening a video/image, looking at a post, commenting, watching a story, sending a message, sending any media file (which btw doesn't work anymore either, you hit 'send' and nothing).",1
"After updating the application. Im unable to open websites on pages. Im clicking the website link given in bio. Its not opening, not clicking at all. Rest things are working. What to do. Need help.",1
"New upgrade is abysmal. Not normally fussed by an app update but this was drastic - the screen is crowded, the text overlay is awful and I can't work out how to minimise the text once I've finished reading. To scroll through it all just seems never-ending and puts me off using it to be honest. Please change it back to be more visually and user friendly.",1
So many ads and suggested posts that you hardly ever see what you actually want to see. So dumb.,1
Not working fine.. it's always say could refresh the feed,1
I have login problem I login my account but there are seeing Could complete your request please try after a moment,1
My Instagram is not working it's show application has blocked so please unblock the application I donot do next time Please,1
"Worst experience ever. Everytime I open my Instagram its shows try again.When I blocked someone and then unblocked after that I searched for his Id, I am not getting it.",1
"awful app, full of bugs, some even are here after almost 2+ years, still haven't fixed them. I can't open videos from chats until I close the app fully (from memory) and start it again. Not talking about million other bugs and problems with constant crashes, ghost messages, lags, seeing same stories every time you refresh... The list goes on and on.. Every 3rd story is an annoying 3-part ad that you have to click through. It went from the best social media to the worst in a couple of years",1
"after the last update,instagram always stopping and my reels are gone i've deleted and download again but it havent worked",1
"They keep changing their layout with no notice and seemingly at random, it updates inconsistently, two accounts in the same device don't get the same layout at the same time, and there's no choice to go back, I don't want shops and I don't want reels, but they just shove it down your throat, I get that they want to promote this features, but I feel this is the wrong way, but we all know this isn't getting fixed, and probably they will just make it worst, like changing the main page to reels.",1
"Unusable! My first account was blocked permanently without a reason. Can't get it back, it's impossible to get in touch with the support. I filled the form, got an email that I should send them my photo with a number for identity(?) confirmation, I have done that 5 times already, never heard back from anyone. I got another account and now the app is faulty. Goes blank and that's it... (Xiaomi and iPhone user)",1
Everytime I enter correct info about my account to login keep saying that my username doesn't belong to an account which is does.,1
I installed the app and tried to make an account and they immediately banned me for no reason and I lost the appeal. I didn't make the account. I meet the age,1
"Comments keep popping up while I'm watching reels, ill change this to 5 stars if a fix appears.",1
So many glitches not working properly why the META is not solving the issues that Instagram users have!!,1
After uninstall I can't even download the app again what's wrong with the Instagram,1
It's lagging behind the video and audio can't matches.,1
"This is among the apps I quickly uninstalled on my phone. Once you are signed up, it's not easy to get to your own profile should you need to tweak a setting or change any information. I have a high IQ and couldn't even make one post! They give you an option to disable your account for a week, but to delete your account you have to do it from a computer not a phone.",1
idk why but when i search for story music it gives me music suggestions instead of the music i search?,1
"Instagram used to be my fav app of all the time, but not anymore.. Its been almost 10 days since i can't post videos on my feed.. I tried after reinstalling the app, i tried it with a small sized video,but no use.. The video turns black once it get posted but the audio works fine. I tried so many times ,but all the results were same.. I asked some of my friends , and few of them are facing the same problem. I hope you guys do something to fix this problem as early as possible..‚òπÔ∏è",1
App isn't what it used to be. Sucks to scroll and just be bombarded with adds that are irrelevant.,1
I lost my account. I know the passwords and everything. I couldn't even reach out to ur support team. Why the do you even exist when you can't even help ur users. Even game companies give better services than you. I've been sending emails after emails and none get replied.,1
"@Atul_x_ 09 in my account swipe reply is not working please check and fix this problem.This problem is since from 2 days, please fixed it fast.",1
"Plagued with frustrating bugs which have been present for years despite I've always used flagship phones. For example, contents such as photos and reels often receive the ""can't be posted"" error message when uploading, and at the same time the draft is deleted, making you lose all editing progress and have to restart from beginning. This grants you a frustrating experience. Why the draft is deleted before the video is successfuly posted? That's some poor quality software engineering over there.",1
"The amount of lost ""drafts"" that I spent a very long time crafting and saving to post for later, astronomical. I'd gotten to the point where I was saving the text portion of my posts on the notes app, but dang, as soon as I forget to do that, THAT'S when Instagram decided to wipe my content off the face of the earth. This has been happening for YEARS. The insights crash everytime I try and look at my post engagement. The algorithms are constantly working against small creators. I'm over it.",1
"Absolutely horrendous update. Photos are ruined by hideous coloured bands making the feed feel claustrophobic, a vignette overlay further spoils the image. Additionally my product tags don't work. Reach and engagement has tanked, presumably to force people to post reels instead, which has a default of ""volume on"" every time you open the app. Ridiculous. My use of the app has drastically decreased, it used to be my #1 but it's pushed me to focus on other platforms to promote my business.",1
Not able to load anything on Instagram.....from last 3 days,1
"I don't want to add phone number, it's just irritating, again and again suggesting as i try to use Instagram",1
"New update: uploading multiple video not working Old update: Uploading a video will become a black screen with audio playing. App crashing when you open a picture or a video from any profile. Scrolling any post in profile throws you to the up. Message not showing at real time even your network's fast. Recording a video on instagram app, the quality is very poor. (Note 10+) So many issues and problems!",1
"The latest updates is so bad that I just want to uninstall this app, it is too glichy. I have tried to uninstall and reinstall multiple times but nothings works. My friends and I have the same version installed but if we compare the visual representation it is completely opposite, and just to add in the end about the latest version it pretty much looks like tik tok now and if I had the option to give lower rating the one star I would've done that too. Please work on the bugs and glitches.",1
"Terrible app. I got my first account suspended which I understand and take responsibility and accountability for, but when I logged on my second account, it got suspended too for absolutely no reason. I had no warnings, I did nothing wrong on that account, I just got suspended for no reason. Terrible app I don't not suggest using.",1
"I'm just gonna stand outside and yell in a parking lot if I wanna report something or need support on instagram, would be way more useful than y'alls reporting system",1
"I've been using Instagram for a while now, but ever since I've edited videos in reels, I can't open it anymore because the app suddenly shut down itself while I was editing. I tried restarting my phone, cleared data, deleted the app and then installed it again, but still it doesn't show anything like when you log in your account, literally nothing. I tried waiting for it a few minutes more, but all there is is a blank screen. I loved using Instagram but I can't open it anymore:((",1
Instagram Note Feature not showing please fix as soon as possible,1
"I came on here to see if I was the only one experiencing issues after the latest updates, and judging by the recent reviews, I'm not! The latest update is rubbish! When I select a real to watch, it just shows me a blank screen and plays the sound only! Everything keeps freezing! I'm finding myself avoiding using the app due to these issues. Such a shame! Don't fix wants not broken Instagram!",1
"Had my account taken down for literally no reason, no warning and no way to recover it even with me verifying my information!",1
Face book have much more option and control if you click. On some pictures by accident automatically like it. I hate 2 finger zooming and dont stay zooming. Videos have no control back and forward. Automatically udjust pictures after post and you find out half of pictures posted. Navigation also so hard menu and setting have no option i dont like it,1
There is no option to temp disabling the account which is given in help article.,1
"Just fed up reporting, ig team gives no response.I'm tired of asking for messenger features on my account but being such a big organisation does not listens to its customers.",1
I can no longer tap into other people's stories and I never seem to get the updates others do thought it's been updated,1
My Instagram was working well but from last two days it is not working.It is now out of order.Nothing is shown in it.please solve my problem.,1

Keeps freezing tried uninstalling and its still happening,1
"I'm only giving 1 star because stories are broken on 18:9 screens. Both left and right sides of stories are cropped out, which makes some content unreadable. Most new phones come with these screens nowadays, yet Instagram doesn't solve this simple issue. Just display the content in a letterbox format with top and bottom black borders, that's easy.",1
Why you are removing reels download option....plz add it...it's was very bad to remove reels download option... plzzzzzzzzzz add... humbly request for you @instagram,1
"Its gone really bad in the last few months! Going blank in a middle of putting up story or post, have to do it again, then uploads super bad quality pics and videos. Doesn't show full list of people who viewed your story! Add every second post. Stories and videos keeps freezing all the time. And so on and on... And there is no way of contacting them to look for help hence I came here and leaving bad review. Would have contacted privately if there was such facility. Very disappointing...",1
"Been trying to make it as an artist on Instagram for 2.5 years but my posts don't even reach people. And when i use the popular hashtags, your bots spam.me with nft account ads.",1
Instagram now requires a phone number? I wanted to use this app while giving minimal personal information. I guess those days are over.,1
"Hey, instagram support team I have been a user of your app for last 3-4 years, and I was having a very good experience with your app but today my instagram account has been disabled without any reason and I am very upset with it I don't know the reason why it has been done so and the resolution given on your instagram support website is also of no use as it says I have to login to my account and follow the steps but the app is not responding So I request you to review this matter and help me",1
Many problems üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°filters are not there on story nd reels filter option is not cming can't make the reels or stories,1
"(This app got a lot worse than it was. Not only has the layout changed into something no one asked for, scrolling has become uncomfortable, algorithms changed into something silly, and features that aren't relevant were shoved into it.) ** 2 years on from my original review above, I hate this app even more. The discover page decides to show me irrelevant things very often, it's 90% irrelevant posts. Even my actual feed where followed pages are supposed to show, is plagued with irrelevance.",1
The most recent updates are quite a bit unnecessary. Replacing the post and notification buttons with reels and shopping?? I've personally never used either of those before when they were only on the explore page and still don't think I will so it's annoying to see the most irrelevant features on my main screen all the time.,1
I had forgotten my password and tried to log in using my phone number and it just wouldn't work after trying for one hour.,1
Plz solve my problem. when I open Instagram they close suddenly and not open plz solve the problem,1
"Feed suddenly isn't chronological anymore. Posts from 2 months ago are pinned to my feed while new ones can't even be seen. No way to keep scolling through ""older"" posts (aka the ones posted a few hours ago). Keeps freezing or saying feed can't be updated. Honestly the list goes on. Never seen an app kill a running and good system (which they had just a few years back) with every update. It just gets worse and worse and I honestly can't even say how f#$/.%* mad I am.",1
Very bad service my Instagram chat has been blocked 3 days what is this,1
I never know weither the app needs to be updated or if it's a glitch.,1
Hello Instagram team I opened my Instagram account and it's showing that your account is suspended and it showed that it will give u a confirmation code and it takes up to a minute to get the code but I didn't got üò≠üò≠üò≠,1
"Not sure if it is because of an update but the text typing experience on comments and replies is horrible now. Whenever i want to type the keyboard appears and hides the typing area and I can't see what I type. Furthermore when I want to erase errors I made in the typing, it won't backspace anymore. There are other issues but this one is kind of the top priority for me right now.",1
"I was so disappointed when this app removed the photobooth option on camera feature. And now, they also removed the multi-capture option üò≠ they are just prioritizing on reels, not everyone enjoys recording themselves tho. I want to go back to the time wherein photobooth and multi-capture is still offered. Furthermore, why do we have to save a picture one by one? Filters are good but it is really annoying that we are required to save every picture one by one that wastes time of the user.",1
Many glitches in it. team instagram please fix the picture glitche !,1
Everything is working properly in my phone. When I want to use instagram processing going on...,1
Such an awful update. What the heck is that notes update!! At least create an option to turn it off,1
"In the past 3-4 days it crashes no matter what i do, i could be scrolling through the feed ori i could be writing a message. It's to the point where I can't even look up a profile because in crashes before it comes up. Also I can't even go to the settings to do something because again it crashes. I like this app but it's unusable right now.",1
"So many glitches,so many bugs, doesn't work smoothly üëé",1
"Bugs galore with a side of glitch. Literally so annoying ever since the most recent update. Stories glitchy af, won't let me share anything on my story, it shows a black screen everytime I try and does the same when I go to use the drawing tool. Uploading anything to my story takes anywhere between 10-20 min with a constant loop of 'try again' when it fails to post.",1
There is an issue with this app. Especially for android. It doesn't seem to refresh even with a good connection. I have changed my connections several time from my home wifi to personal data to offic wifi. I have uninstall and reinstall again just for it to work for 5 minutes and then the issue comes again. Please get it fixed. I have been having this issue for the past 4 days. I have reported the bug but still no reply.,1
Messages problem. Always have to refresh to see new messages,1
Why is everyone getting hacked on this app. What happened to security. People hack other people with ease and then scum their followers.,1
"can't disable Auto playing videos ... and bring back video seeker/sharing reels in story is painful, it takes ages",1
I had new phone i can't login there is glitch or something else on the other phone it i working so many people are going through the same issue kindly resolve it asap.....,1
Terrible on a tablet. Why can't the app scale properly for horizontal viewing?,1
"Horrible app , getting worse day by day and seeing issues throughout",1
"New update is the worst, can't scroll smoothly, doesnt tag people properly in the photo, save button is now hidden, sound is always on when you open the app, it favours videos rather than photos and promotes way more content you dont follow than what you do, captions are uncomfortable to read and block the content. With each update they just make it less userfriendly. Don't ""fix"" what's not broken.",1
"my videos are not progressing 4000 Even after having followers, there are fewer views Instagram.id... @baby2002ww",1
"Used to be great, but all the changes have made the app insufferable. Numerous unnecessary ""features"" with no customization. I don't care about ""suggested posts"" topics on instagram. Most of the suggestions aren't even decent, and you can only snooze them for 30 days before instagram forces it again. Same with the ""shake to report a bug"" feature. I've turned that off every bug report but instagram doesn't seem to care. If the app gave me actual control of my settings it would be fine.",1
"Someone gotta tell the app's developers to stop ruining it. It was decent and now it keeps on crushing. I can't make a story, or a post- it keeps freezes and while making a story the photo is simply a blur, never clears. It doesn't refresh the feed, doesn't show the messages- a complete mess! Just make it decent again and leave it alone unless there's something necessary to add/fix ‚ò†Ô∏è",1
"A lot of terrible bugs!!! I can't use this app from my device anymore. I can't watch videos - they're all played incorrectly: blinking, overlapping with black squares, or the picture is just full of noise. How should I deal with this? I also reported this issue to dev. team, however, a lot of time has passed and still nothing changed. Do something, please!",1
This is not good because this app is not providing the theme on my mobile üì± and also it is not comfortable to give a reply with emojis to my frnds msgs and so many problems is there will u plz update the app with better features i hope u will,1
I have a blank screen on login. I use a web browser to access Instagram but it does not have all the utilities/ease of the app. The problem has been around since the end of July 2022. One of my accounts also got hacked and developers have done nothing to help get my account back. I'm waiting for the app to come out with a new update to see if the app crashing is fixed.,1
Dear Instagram Please solve my problem and keep up your rate Please available my swipe reply option 2 year use Instagram but I not found swipe reply Please Please,1
"been experiencing problems in my apps since early morning, I cannot login via my android apps. what is the problem?",1
"I gave the app, not instagram itself, one star because it's beginning to be a problem. Three times now after the last update the app would uninstall itself from my phone. I'd reinstall it thinking some spirit forces did the job. But after three repeat, and I live alone and it is impossible for me to uninstall three times when I'm not crazy. I don't know what's wrong with the app, but this is the fourth time I'm installing it. If it repeats again after restarting my phone, that's it. I'm done.",1
"User since 2013.. every update just keeps getting worse and worse. Why do you have to keep changing everything? EDIT: Now they have recommended posts flooding my homepage feed from people I don't even follow. Also, when I click on a photo, and hit the back button - it brings me right back up to the top of the page, and I have to waste more time scrolling all the way back down to the bottom. This app is no longer user friendly.. did you guys even bother to test it?",1
"Very frustrating. Unable to recover my account due to no obvious reasons. Either in the app or on the browser, I keep getting the message that ""confirm your info in the app"". When I go to app to confirm info, I see the same message there. Its even more frustrating to see that there is no live chat or customer support to get real time help.",1
I can not play games when in call only. Because the screen suddenly blank when touch it. There is nothimg promblem like this in the previous update..,1
Very disgusting sometimes. The app got stuck when uploading stories with adding music on them. Also the Selfie sticker didn't work. I sent to my friend and it's not working. Now i am unable to send other messages to my friend because the Selfie sticker is being sent. Pathetic. !!!! Also can't logout my Account. The message showing something is uploading. But it is not working...,1
Absolutely terrible. For the past few days I have had no end of issues. Constant freezing and my messages won't send unless I keep switching between mobile data and WiFi. For some reason it keeps saying I have messages that were sent days ago and when I do actually receive a message it won't show and will refuse to show recent messages. It's awful and I dislike using it. Probably going to delete my account and uninstall.,1
"After the recent update, the application is being unable to open any posts, pic or videos. It simply keeps on buffering. Even the DMs aren't being delivered although the network is showing good connectivity. When we swipe / slide, it slides many posts making it unable to stop and read a particular post. It was way better before updating to the latest version.",1
"I always type to them about their problems, they never reply and they are never fixing the problems. I can't figure out why they are releasing updates when there isn't anything new with message-sending which most often needs 5min to be delivered, as well as the pictures which are sent need 5min minimum to be delivered, or closing the application and re-opening it. Their updates are always focused on the aesthetics, but never on the software problems which previous versions had. Not good",1
"After 8 years of using Instagram they disabled my account without violating their terms and conditions and their customers service is so poor. I had to go through facebook live agent chat to reach them and they said it was a mistake and would reactivate it, but nothing was ever done. It's best to move your gallery and lifes work to another platform where no one can take it away from you. Period!",1
My Instagram not updating properly and not showing reply option so please check and correct the mistake with as early as soon pls reply to my message not responding means I take a another action,1
"In July 2019 all my pictures were deleted and I never got them back. This was happening to other users at the same time with pictures not loading or showing up on the profile. While this issue was fixed and people got their posts back, I never did. I submitted many reports on this but I never got any response. You'll used to have a support email address and any issue addressed through this was always responded to and handled efficiently. Unfortunately this option is not available anymore.",1
"All of a sudden, I don't have anything showing on my main page or my posts. No fotos at all, just a blank page, no followers or following. Nothing loads on the search tab. Everything just disappeared for no apparent reason. This is insane! Sent a message reporting the issue through the help center and never got an email to acknowledge it or for anything really. Very frustrating!! Is there a real customer service or IT for this service???",1
Sir mera instagram nii chal raha hai pls sir or mam pls try fix the bug there is a black screen I had uninstalled it so many time again downloaded it so many time I restart my phone but there is nothing happen sir pls try to fix it ü•∫,1
"Someone help!! Maybe it's not able to update, but I don't have features in my Instagram that I should, like holding in storys to create a longer video with continuous clips rolling over, or the new one having the quizes in storys, etc. I thought maybe it has something to do with the beta testing program, but no I tried both ways. I thought maybe it's because I'm not iphone, but someone with the same phone as me has these features and i still don't! I'm confused.",1
All app is working good but My insta is not proper working some days,1
My Instagram is not working shows that couldn't refresh feeds........,1
My messages are not coming and same I also can't able to send messages or vedieos to anyone,1
This algorithm is a mess. Everything takes longer to load since reels were added. No one even asked for reels or a shopping feature either. All we want is to be able to see pictures in chronological order of our family and friends who we follow instead we get random repetitive ads. Stop adding new features and maybe listen to your audience.,1
"This app used to work quite well until a few days ago. Now it wont open, just a white screen for a fraction of a second, then , nothing. So, after restarting the tablet, clearing the cache, re-installing the app, rebooting the wifi, airplane mode, still nada. No solutions anywhere. So, I have no app anymore.",1
"theres 2 problems with the instagram that I have. Firstly, the videos that I sent or the videos that people send me dont have any audio sound AT ALL. Secondly, when I scroll through someone's page and click on their post (which is pretty far from the top), after I leave the post, I get sent back to the beggining/top of the person's profile. I've tried restarting my phone, I even uninstalled and reinstalled it. It's always there and It's so irritating, please fix these bugs!",1
hacked and hated by half the posts i can't choose not to be recommended in my search feed. the user recommendations on my profile page make it feel like a grim free-ware that needs to pay to get better except it doesn't get better. everyone's a micromarket now and it sucks. never felt so hated,1
Can't save stories as picture or videos .. is it a glitch or an update ? Bring that feature back.,1
I can't reach my sim and email I can't confirm my account although it is linked to my Facebook account. I know the username and password,1
"The new update is GARBAGE. Longer captions now appear over the photo when expanded, I can't read anything if the photo has a light background?? No option for ""translate"" on captions in a different language?? There's no indication if a post has more than one photo?? Posts by random people I don't follow appearing in my feed? And overall look and feel is just really UGLY. Please change it back????? I do however somewhat enjoy the new swiping experience, but that's it.",1
"Latest update has ruined the experience. Posts now all have an unnecessary added colour to make them fill the screen, and the order of the posts is completely random. It's now next to impossible to see the posts of the accounts you follow. Lastly the ability to save a post to a collection easily is gone, major downgrade. Stories and messages are about the only things that still work well.",1
"Can Instagram add the ""Align"" feature in Reels for all Android users!! I hate that some features are not available. I'm using a brand new Samsung, there should be no reason why all the features are not available to every user. So frustrating! Edit to add: 06-09-21 Sound and video are totally off-sync in stories/reels/lives!! Seeing it all over Instagram. Get it together Instagram and fix this bug!!!",1
Unable to login. Getting error message everytime.,1
"Randomly a few videos and reels hang while playing the video on a frozen screen of one of the frames of the video but the audio keeps playing properly. Even after refreshing the profile or post, the same behaviour is replicated. There is no pattern to which ones will hang and which ones don't. Other videos of the same profile work well. It's a mystery",1
Reels save option is not available on insta story after this new update üòµüò© so due to this issue I am not satisfied with this new update and I am gonna give 1 star to Instagram üôÇ,1
"Takes your money but regularly fails. There's no service when things go wrong. I couldn't get my money back when I tried to run an ad for 4 days, it took my money but didn't run the ad. Gave up trying to resolve it, cut to today, built up near 2k followers, spent ¬£168 in total on ads, suddenly feature stops working and there's no support. There's a glimmer of hope if you're in US, in UK, there's zero support. You can 'report an error to improve the service', but pot luck if it gets looked into.",1
"I'm really disappointed that an app this successful, owned by one of the biggest companies in the world, continues to disregard the 75% of the market who don't use iOS. There's no excuse given their resources. Recently even the Superzoom feature has stopped working on my phone - and it's not a cheap phone. In fact it's the world's first and only 4k screen, with a ppi 78% larger than the iPhone X. With more GHz and more RAM too they can't blame the tech. Highly irritating.",1
Voice message sometimes don't load! Update: now certain photos that I'm trying to post doesn't even get posted at the scale I want because it keeps on cropping the image. There's isn't even an option at the corner where I can zoom out and put the full size image! I've never hated instagram as much as I do now. They never respond to my complaints and the problems just keep on adding up. I'm going to delete instagram and I will encourage all my friends to also delete this useless app!,1
"App keeps crashing!!! Just want to post a few IG stories and it keeps saying IG keeps stopping. i see absolutely no reason why it keeps crashing. My Wi-Fi is fine, and yet it doesn't work even when I switched to mobile data. Used to be a good app but ever since instagram keeps having updates, especially recently, it's been going downhill. Been keeping one eye closed but now it's just testing my patience.",1
"Music sticker feature isn't available on my main account. It works perfectly fine on my second account but for some reason it won't show up on my main account which is incredibly annoying. All my friends have it and use it happily but I'm the only one among them who doesn't have it. I feel left out and nearly discriminated. I use Instagram mainly for sharing music, so I'm really not happy. I hope someone can do something about it. I've been a beta tester for years.",1
"Stop ruining Instagram by turning it to ticktock. Give an option to disable reels. What's the point of having an explore tab when suggested posts are showing up on the home tab? This compromises the whole UI. Why does it take me back to a page's very top when I'm coming back from viewing an image from the bottom? These aren't improvements, but rather put offs.",1
Can you please give me an opportunity to turn this stupid suggest posts in my home feed off! It is awful! All my feed is now full of some stuff I never wanted to see. If there will be no fix of this problem I will delete Instagram and install tiktok! I can't stand it anymore! Furthermore after it was bought by Facebook there are so many problems in it. For example: The app started to upload my story 2 days ago and then there was some kind of error so it is still uploading. I CAN'T STOP IT NOW!,1
"The amount of times I've had to uninstall and reinstall this app is utterly ridiculous. Clicking on a direct message notification crashes the app, photos become distorted, adding to your story crashes the app, force stopping and clearing the cache does nothing. This latest update has rendered the app unusable. This needs to be patched immediately. Update: even going on my account to report the bug crashes the app, so I cannot even show why the app isn't working. Someone better get fired for it.",1
"The app often has issues when opening stories' notifications. It also seems it wrongly accuses people (not me, thankfully) of providing false info and attaches supposedly independent research which in truth is done by mainstream media, which is not at all independent. When you want to change your phone number, it's nearly impossible to get the verification code. If you want bugs, propaganda and no answer from customer service, this is the service to use. Otherwise, move on.",1
"It does keep you connected and you can see feeds and photos but the ads are super annoying and support isn't very helpful or even optional most of the time, plus I'm not a fan of the updates where the information being updated isn't given by the developer, I think that an app that has access to personal information should be very transparent when it comes to updates as I would like to know what I'm agreeing to.",1
"I love the app but an update seems to have completely broken the video compression when uploading. Cannot use the app for videos at all because the quality ends up being unwatchable. I remember, back in June it was absolutely fine and even with the same phone now, I can't fully utilize the app. Please fix this.",1
"The app shows that it has been fully updated, yet I am having so much difficulty posting a picture, it is not allowing me to fit a picture in the frame when I select multiple photos and videos, it is also not allowing me to edit them or tag person and when I attempted posting a picture for the 10th time, it said there was an error when posting and the picture or video cannot be posted. I also had the issue of this app not allowing me to edit any of my posts and it just shuts down randomly.",1
"I'm really losing patience with this new format where once you've scrolled through new posts, you get endless 'suggested pages'. When you click to view older posts, the older posts jump to the top, losing the most recent posts. I DO NOT want to see suggested pages, I just want to be able to scroll through my timeline and see all posts one after the other with some form of continuity! SORT IT OUT!!!!!!",1
The main issue I'm facing is nt able to share stry who mentioned me nd they're also nt able to share my stry i updated several times nd changed my stry sitting option still d same,1
"Again. Every Single. Time.. You. Update. This. And don't state what you've changed? Something on the app messes up. Stories won't work or notification bar won't work, app force closes itself literally in a different way every single time you mess with it! The amount of times I've had to uninstall and reinstall.. And even that doesn't fix half the mess your developers have butchered. Sort it out. Every single update it just messes the functionality of the app. Stop rolling updates out too early.",1
"The app's UI is HORRIBLE on the Samsung Galaxy A70. It doesn't even take advantage of the screen. What's even worse is that the app works awfully with the front camera. It just zooms in and there's no option to adjust the ratio. I highly doubt 1080x2400 pictures are actually supported for stories on most other devices, so I don't know why the app would try to take pictures of that resolution.",1
"There is virtually no customer support for the app. I've now lost an account with years worth of pictures and no way of getting the account back. Tried calling multiple numbers listed for Instagram, tried looking for emails, tried reaching out on multiple social media platforms. If you use Instagram, just be warned. If you lose anything there's no support from the deva of this app. I'll personally stay clear in future.",1
"The new update is really weird. For some reason, I have not been able to get the cross-app messaging feature which allows you to reply to messages in the DM. I have two instagram accounts and only one of them got the update while the other hasn't even after repeated reinstallations. I have made sure that my Facebook is linked with my Instagram but still no update. Really disappointing.",1
Addictive in a detrimental way. UI and algorithm are not in your favour.,1
"This app used to be stable and usable at any time, but since it has been owned by Facebook, and now it's rebrand, Meta, it has been working at a strongly disappointing quality. With issues such as app crashes, inability to send or receive messages and general bugs and malfunctions inside the app. It has brought to me, and many users, nothing but many disappointments. Please, manage this app properly, it's rate of failure is starting to get annoying.",1
"They just keep introducing features that nobody asked for. I could sit here and type for hours about all the inconsistent functionality, stupid features, hard-to-navigate menus, and a plethora of other issues (not to mention the privacy-invading terms of service) but I don't want to waste my time.",1
"This app got so bad, everytime they make a pointless update the calls crash or hang up on their own, the stories freeze and crash all the time. Since the last update everytime I pass 10 posts the app crashes and tells me to send a review, but it doesn't let me send one. Also now if my friends send me videos, I click on them and the app crashes. Instead of eliminating the stories (which it was the only good thing you guys did for this app) maybe you should fixed all the bugs this app has.",1
"Must be a sign that this rating pop up. I've been sending lots of 'report a problem' to Instagram help but has not seen the light! Can someone please look into this problem and help solve it. Tried everything that I found on Google including checking a million times that allow sharing of story is enabled, uninstalling and reinstalling with latest version and restarts but still not able to see the 'add story' and other users are not able to share my story on both personal and business accounts!",1
"I hope im not the only one but it lags everytime i open it, like most of the time, it pissed me off i cant even type anything. Yes i've tried on another apps, and it doesn't lag so i'm guessing it Insta's fault. Oh and I tried to post something on my story, but it kept saying ""error"", this wasn't my first time, it happend like all the time. It took me 5 or 6 times to repost it. I hope you could fix the problems ASAP.",1
"Their support team is totally inaccessible. I've lost access to an old phone number attached to my account, and so can't reset my password. Their troubleshooting menu literally sends me in a loop in the FAQs and there is no way to contact anyone about this. When I finally found a form to contact someone about something else I tried to use it and still haven't heard back months later.",1
Check your lay out when editing. It crops no good.,1
Keep on keep on crashing and losing every features like reacting on post theme of chats saving reel option just the worst app ever,1
I keep receiving my Instagram messages late. update: app keeps closing out 2 stars to 1 star.,1
"I've been using Instagram for so many years but never felt this kind of issue. Due to some bug interruption I wont be able to access my account as its coming completely blank. I've made the complaint several times but didn't get a single response from ur technical team. This is insane n extremely non ignorant that an app with so much integrity n customer data base, still won't be able to fix the issue as I saw as many as 10 complaints regarding with the same. As of now, I've uninstalled it",1
"I have been using Instagram for some years now it's a great app but from few days it's not working. Nothing appers on the screen. It's blank and shows error, couldn't refresh. I had to make another account because of that. And the another account is also facing issues more than half of the songs do not work on reels. And the reels are not even scrolling. Please take of this as soon as possible .I hope that this gets fixed very soon.",1
"The recent algorithm is pathetic. I'm an art creator and it has limited my reach to very less number of people. It's not even the 50% of what it was in the past. This app has now turned into mini tiktok with its reels and stuff. It used to be such a great app for good content creators before. The algorithm is such a waste. There are useless dance reel videos everywhere. The app has started degrading the quality of its content, by introducing useless features. I hope it gets back to what it was.",1
Very unuseful app because I make very good editing video and share on Instagram but i have no likes and no views so pls solve this problem üôèüòû,1
"Awful. I can't log in with any account, and worst part is, I can't even create a new one. The Instagram support team is awful as they do not have this as one of their listed errors, but yet closed their email and suggest to check the help center. No help at all. I've been trying to fix an other issue where I couldn't use gifs, polls or any of the interactive features of my story, but once again no help center for that. 0/10 will never use again.",1
Reels stuck and stutter alot. Either I've to touch or swipe lightly to solve this issue. I think it's software issue,1
"Not to able to react and reply any specific message, üëé",1
"Idk how you managed to make the ui and ux worse. I feel like you are intentionally doing it. Its so buggy, videos keep freezing, muting videos is annoying, half the time i can't even text someone because the text field randomly disappears so i have to leave then come back for it to reappear, the video call button is so close to the side that people always accidentally start video calls. Its like your purposely trying to give the users a TERRIBLE time.",1
"This app doesn't work properly,i didn't do anything but it showing your account is suspended.i don't know what was the reason for that? Can anyone explain the reason for that ?",1
"Notification settings keep changing automatically for those I'm following. No matter how many times I cjange it within a week it reverts back. Shouldn't have this problem in this day and age. Translation rarely works and only on the original post, nothing for comments which is pathetic. Sounds and videos don't always play/work. Photo's sometimes appear blank and need to restart the app a few times before it works. Supprt never replied to any of my issues.",1
"Deleted this because a recent update or test has installed snap scrolling on my account and there's no way to disable it. Can't read captions without snapping to the next post, can't look at a post properly without it snapping up or down. But of course any ad posts are just the right format and are snapped to the centre of your screen. It became so annoying that it made it unusable for me and I've deleted until the test is over. If it rolls out to the whole app I won't bother reinstalling.",1
My Instagram won't update for 2 years now. Only on my account but when someone else logs in it has all the new features that mine doesn't. My account can't react or highlight messages. There is so much that I can't do that others can. Team please help. I've tried to contact Instagram via email years back but still waiting for a response and for the problem to be fixed.,1
Very hard to get out of this app when you are hacked! Beware!! No Stars!,1
"If I wanted Tiktok, I'd be using Tiktok. What once was a great app for photos and images is now absolute trash, a Tiktok wannabe, with bunch of short videos I'm not interested in. There is an option to browse reels only. But then on the Home, it's 90% reels again?! Doesn't make any sense at all. I'm not saying you should get rid of the Reels, just PLEASE bring back the option to browse only photos/posts. I'm not even browsing home anymore for how annoying all the reels on there are.",1
"Extremely frustrating UX. Why would you not let us see basic information about our account such as follow requests we've sent in one place? There used to be this feature in the settings section (where you will rage quit before you'd ever find the option you were looking for) and now you've made it inaccessible for who knows why. Maybe you want to cut server costs because of the ongoing recession. Well I wont be using it anytime soon, so congrats!",1
Where do the features of Instagram go sometimes.... üò°üò°üò° no music and other features please fix fast,1
"Videos don't play! Takes hours for pictures to load and don't even get me started on add selection. You always show me adds that are not even slightly related to what I'm following. No notification for messages and once I read it the notifications comes afterwards. Fix it once and for all, it is turning into a load of garbage.",1
The instagram algorithm only wants to show you what meta wants you to see instead of the people or hashtags your following and chats break if you send your friends links it doesn't like. üòê,1
When I am adding to story and sharing post or reel at that time it is only automatically deleting so I want to do,1
"I've had this app for years and just recently it has become unusable. It wont load and nothing shows up. No pictures, stories, or reels.",1
Filled with bugs that annoy me all the time. You can't see any stories and can't type in stories The keyboard just pops up and goes down if you close and open through recent tabs. Some times I can't hear any sound in stories for the same reason. While texting the send button disappears. Even after years face a lot of bugs daily. Worst ever updates. Also I can't watch some reels fully it goes blank in the middle. No matter what you do never plays fully. Nothing changes even if u r upto date,1
My account has been blocked from several days i cant like any post and send follow request to anyone one of them Please fix it soon,1
Worst app. Not working properly even in good network. It always take so much loading time,1
Now it's not an social app b'coz there is no section what kind of content will appear in reels or posts it has to be divided into types.,1
It's been a month and I still cannot access my profile page..this app literally sucks,1
"The algorithms literally won't show me new posts; I get one post from 2 days ago, an ad, then ""suggested posts"". Is the point to make people stop using the app?",1
Error in editing pictures when upload more than one in the same post.,1
Post collaboration option not available in most of the Android devices,1
Once again Instagram strikes with the glitches after the latest update.... locks up while watching stories now and can't even exit app.... ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,1
Worst app. The app has blocked me for 3 days saying that i can't msg anyone. Without any reason. I didn't like this app. Pls don't download the app,1
Currently unable to log in my account at all! I have a new phone but all my info is the same. I tried everything!,1
Unable to post reels...Have contacted you for helping out...never violated a single community rule.. Still not able to post.. since 5 days im unable to post reels..,1
"It's becoming impossible to use the app and I use it on a daily basis for work. Reels will disappear without no reason whatsoever nowhere to be found, neither in the recently deleted nor in the archived or taken down content. When uploading videos, they will be zoomed to such an extent the text won't be visible anymore. And all the complaints are unanswered. What has happened to you Instagram? üòï",1
Worst social app Suspend my account for no reason and it's more than 20 days even now my account didn't activated Solve my problem as soon as possible,1
"I have to close it and open it and close it again at least five times before it works. every time I open it, its frozen and wont respond, so I close it, open it again, still frozen, repeat UPWARDS of five times, as sometimes it takes way more. I dont have this problem with any other app, but I do with Instagram. fix this bug please. I'll change my rating when it's fixed. edit; It has been over a month and it literally only got worse. Thinking of just deleting it altogether. Almost not worth it..",1
What has happened to this app? Posting pictures is an awful experience now. So glitcy,1
"Instagram is genuinely the worst platform imaginable. Forget the toxicity everyone goes on about, it's just the fact it's so far away from user friendly. Can't zoom in, can't save pictures, can't scroll.. I go to post a reel and the post button isn't there, things disappear from drafts when you hit the new post button, suggestions are all over the place, comments full of bots.. the entire platform is unimaginably bad. Like it's been done by an intern with no experience. *Awful*.",1
"Instagram is not showing the Time of chats, please help",1
It s annoying. I couldnt wrote any captions. Try to find the solution but didnt work.,1
Can't be logged into two devices For some reason my Instagram won‚Äôt allow two devices to be logged in at the same time,1
"I absolutely loved this app but I just got hacked and Instagram is doing nothing about it. I've sent the selfie video multiple times and yet I'm told that it can be verified. I don't even post pics with filters so I don't look any different in the video. I've sent an email but haven't gotten a response. After speaking with friends and googling it, it turns out that it's basically hopeless and that I'll essentially never get my account back.",1
If the person i followed post anything to their ig story. I only can see the video. The pics move to fast and i cant go back. This sucks!,1
Just wish you would stop with the updates every other day your killing it and now I have to keep saving my password every time I log in I shouldn't have to,1
"I have been trying to log into my account and I keep getting an error saying ""please try again after a few minutes"". This has been going on for four hours now.",1
Translation feature broken. Lots and lots and lots of fake profiles and trolls.,1
"App has way too much issues, bugs, crashes etc on a consistent basis now. I understand your tech team is working on the problem trying to solve the situation, but it seems more than anything you provide a quick fix which lasts for a certain amount of time then another issue or bug arises again. All am asking is for an app which runs at the best optimum level. Thank you for your time reading this concern, hopefully the feedback given goes someway into a better app fully functional.",1
My account was disabled and I never broke the community guidelines.this is not at all appropriate I didn't got any message regarding it and the second I opened it again my I'd was disabled and it was saying user not found,1
No swipe option and no emoji reaction on messages .Please fix it as soon as possible.,1
Message swipe option and message reaction not working I reported many times but till now the problem is not solved,1
"I love this app but now I'm so frustrating cause the post can't seen, stories won't show, video won't play & message pending, can't change the profile picture. I can't post picture, video, story & reels anymore. I can't refresh the feed. I tried to clear cache, clear data, force stop, uninstall then reinstall again log in & it's not working. I can't update this app. I tried everything & there's nothing I could do. Please fix this!!!",1
New version of Instagram is not good they remove the download option and many more function like reply in message,1
"Constantly crashes. Nothing but trash shown on it now, too. (Update: 11/9/22). Still, to this day, it seems Instagram has done little to fix their bug issues. This is becoming a serious problem. (Update: 11/11/22) STILL CONSTANTLY CRASHES MAKING REELS, EVEN AFTER UPDATING APP AND PHONE SOFTWARE!!!! RIDICULOUS! HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO POST FOR 3 DAYS NOW!!!! WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS APP IF IT DOESNT WORK!!!! (Update 11/11/22) just deleted APP and reinstalled. Now all my reels are stories",1
"Every time I try to open the reels section, it says 'Something went wrong'. At times they do open but only manage to show around 3-5 reels after not letting me scroll down anymore. Also the reels are loading very slowly after the recent update. If I try to send reels from a full screen view, it almost always gives me the error of failed to send message. I've tried to clear cache, data, reinstall the app, restart my phone. Nothing works.",1
My Instagram keeps stopping and won't allow me create a post.,1
"STILL This app sucks, I have Uninstalled and reinstalled it never refreshes my feed always on the same post.... Obviously, no one cares",1
useless ; full of bugs and change appearance on its own,1
Hy Instagram team add a feature in which we can remove one pic from two photo of crousal post.,1
I've been updating the app but i still don't have the notes function in my account,1
Mine doesn't have any filters. I deleted and redownloaded it but still,1
My account with username _mr_ambitious._. has been disabled without any reason . They did so with their own choice . It's shame to use such kind of apps that tries to control other people,1
"Been hacked... Following the people's that I don't know, when I then check the following number rise up to 1k. When I decided to clear the following it then go back to the numbers again. Cant clear the following , bad experiences",1
I am not able to react on messages! And not able to see notes.,1
"Disappointed I had boosted my posts, Instagram disabled my account without any reason and didn't refund my money. They are the biggest fraud of the social media industry.",1
"Doesn't even open, uninstalled and tried again, app just glitches and closes won't even open...",1
Buggy- saved something now a banner covers every image I scroll to.,1
"My stories keep bombing out. The picture will freeze but the audio keeps going when I try upload. Filters keep getting removed. The icons on the top for text, stickers ect is often not there. Other people's stories will play with no audio. I'm missing messages. The icon will have notifications but no new messages. Ive cleared the cache and the data, uninstalled and reinstalled the app but still have the same issues. This is ridiculous for one of the largest apps in the world. ZERO STARS.",1
"I'm trying to post a story but it just keeps loading even if I refresh the app, force close, etc.. Can't delete the story or even switch accounts because of this, and I manage other accounts so it's a bit frustrating. DMs don't load properly, and every time I open the app I get notifications for past DMs even though I already read them. Lastly, still hoping for that chronological order option.",1
"not the best. honestly after the update to have voice messaging it went downhill. like even when i dont click on it it turns on and im sick of it. it turns of my screen, doesnt let me turn it off and is just a complete annoyance. if i could do anything about the app i would delete video messaging all together. its more of an annoyance than actually useful.",1
"I've been updating the app once every month and it's getting worse every time i do so. the display looks more like a desktop one : large and there's always missing text or part of a pic/video, the app freezes after about 10 minutes of use, uploading a video takes forever , should i also talk about the video quality? i upload a 1080p video but it looks like a 180p when it's uploaded.",1
"Since the lastest version this is having too issues like stopping and closing suddenly, takes too long to open the app and even crashing in the process, making me to close and try again for four times or more during the day which is not normal. When I try to post a photo it close or just jump to home in the app so even I try to do the process again it just jump to the home in the app again, the same happens when I try to post a story. In a few words, this has been the worst update ever on my ph.",1
"It has been wonderful using the app for the past few years, but the past few weeks have been hell! üò≥ üëéüèΩüëéüèΩI cannot upload stories and even feeds, I was advised to restart my phone but still nothing. I've even uninstalled the app but it doesn't want to install (network is good). I'm so disappointed right now because it's one of the apps that keeps life alive esp during this time of not meeting people physically. Insta please sort this problem out asap!",1
"There are a few reasons why you might not be able to add music to your Instagram Story, and they include: You live in a country where the feature isn't available. Music is enabled on the app in over 90 countries, but due to Instagram's strict adherence to copyright law, it's disabled in some countries (_India)",1
"Can't add multiple images to a post in the update that now includes two rows of stories (which I don't want). Long hold no longer selects multiple images, it just switches to the one you're currently trying to add. If this feature has been moved somewhere else, it's far from intuitive.",1
"New update is awful. I have a business account and a personal, and I keep getting notifications for messages for one account when I'm on the other. I can only scroll back about 20 notifications, comments won't load. Videos won't load in messages without closing and reopening the app. Reels have replaced a really interesting explore feature that helped with my business. Stop trying to be other platforms.",1
"The app used to be perfect, but after the last update there's something that's very annoying that the app seem to be doing. When I open someone's profile and scroll through some old posts and open it, when I hit the back button it sends me straight to the top/latest posts of that profile.. Fix this problem urgently as it's really annoying to scroll down again and again after opening a post.",1
Ahhh it's sucks..üò°üò°üò°it's like message status problem I can't fix it after deleting the app and I installed it again..but again it's like that only what the hell is this..?,1
"I prefered the previous interface as compared to this new update. I understand the need to create more exposure for stores operating on Instagram, but is there really a need to remove the button to add to the story? it is so much more inconvenient to as people have to go to their profile, or in my case, i have to login to the web version instead just to upload to my story. please fix this issue.",1
Worst possible support team out there. So many bugs and they are just chilling. I hope Elon buys Facebook and Instagram because fukarburg doesn't give damn about this anymore,1
"The latest update sucks. This platform is money hungry and doesn't care about its users. All we want is the like button in its rightful place and for chronological order to come back. We never asked for reels, a SHOPPING button or for ""suggested posts"". Even the preview image still has the like button lol. Soooo many ads. You're running yourself into the ground.",1
I can't watch reels because they are blurry and filters don't work.,1
"There's this bug in app where its not loading a group of images as a thumbnail to post on my wall. And if I select these images from gallery I'm not able to share them to insta too. I tried resetting the insta, clearing data etc and nothing worked. And it's not loading the same set of images and its damn frustrating. I'm really annoyed right now.",1
"All photos and videos need to be 1:1, this needs 3rd party editing apps. Even if all photos and videos are the right size it'll still crop bits, everything has to be the same either portrait or landscape when you upload multiple pictures. Then it still won't let you and say ""sorry there was a probelm with editing your video""",1
It's the full bugging app...I can't switch to professional account ..even I can't see connected accounts...fully glitches in this new updates..plz make sure before releasing it...üò†,1
"As soon as i enter home in app, it will close automatically. Fix this bug quick",1
"I had been using Insta for about 6 years, although I've loved it for being a great photo sharing application, I can't stand it anymore because of that unbearable amount of sponsored post and product placement among regular posts. I feel like I'm on an product survey that tries to hit me with it's algorithms with as many targeted advertisement as possible. So I decided to switch to 500px wich seems to be the best alternative to Instagram for photography.",1
"Instagram changed the algorithm to try and push people to use their advertising options more, by only showing your posts to 10% of your audience. It's really damaging a lot of people's hardwork, especially of they have built up a business on this platform. Really discouraging, and I think it's time to start looking for alternative platforms.",1
"Where did my drafts go after a recent update? Everything was moved around and I cannot find pictures I had saved to post on my feed. I have reported the issue via the app, but had no response, which does not encourage me to keep using the platform. I have to agree with all the other reviews around the recent update - it is the worst thing that happened to instagram for a while, and I have been using the app for years. Can you demonstrate your users you care and get this fixed?",1
"i dont know what you guys did but IG sucks right now!!! i am pissed to the point of deleting my account. it won't open, all i get is a blank screen, everything loads slowly once it eventually even shows up on my screen and freezes non stop. i tried uninstalling, i ve been force stopping all the time and even that doesn't help anymore. fix it before, and someone will, makes a much better and more novel app. sincerely, everyone!",1
"I am not able to login since morning. Despite of several mails attached with relevant screenshots, nobody has responded with a resolution. They send the same automated expired links. What has happened overnight. I am really pissed off since morning. Tried all troubleshooting options. No luck. Please do the needful. The new update is worst.",1
"For the past year now, I am always having some sort of issue with the app. A little bit ago, it would delete dms without me touching anything. And right now it doesn't let me make drafts, or watch videos my friends send me. There have been many other issues I've had in between, and it seems like every time they fix one thing, three more are messed up",1
"The app gets worse with each update. Then for what reason do you keep an update? My views were pretty good but it suddenly frozen and not increasing for more than an hour even after getting more likes. Please fix this. Now it has got problem with the cover images. It's showing upside down and when i post the reel, far funnier that i dont want to even mention how it looks.",1
I just updated my phone & app & now it won't let me send messages at all,1
"A weird issue has started recently where I can hear the sound of the video but I can't see the video playing. I'll have to go into the persons profiles who has posted the video to see the video playing, I've deleted and reinstalled the app once but after closing and opening the app the issue started again. Maybe you guys are pushing some kinda fix or something after install thats causing the issue? It's kinda annoying...Otherwise love the app",1
"This app is just bad now, I can't even respond to specific messages or access my other account",1
My Instagram is nOt up to date I'm still not using latest version and play store didnot shOw update option,1
App keeps on crashing when editing reels or posting photos.,1
"I don't know what happend but lately I found that the descriptions of posts are cut of at the site. like they won't break into a new line they just keep going in which case I had to scroll to the right wich you can't do... so most of them are just cut off in the middle of the sentence, cause my phone display size is done at that point and as I said before u can't scroll the description to the right... just hit me up if you need prof, have a bunch of screenshots saved.",1
"Instagram was so great before this whole reels scene came up! Minus one star. Instagram can provide an option for user to turn off reels. It would be great. Notifications arrive late! I have read the message & replied back, there comes my notification for the same message. Reactions also not working in DM. I raised help twice, no action from Instagram. Minus 2 stars. Instagram was a great platform for art & artists. Now its a platform for private services & onlyfan advertisement. Minus 1 star.",1
Insights crash when changing timeframe; currently experiencing an issue with my reels posting upside down,1
"1) Can't add a caption for each photo within an album 2) Can't have an album with both portrait and landscape photos 3) For a photo app, it uses wierd dimensions 4) Can't forward/rewind/pause videos 5) Can't even add a line spacing when commenting or adding a caption Overall a very poor quality, overhyped app. Brand awareness and associated network effects are keeping it alive.",1
"I wanted to reinstall the app because some major bugs stopped me from viewing my messages, amongst other issues. However, when I tried to open the reinstalled app, it keeps on crashing and I subsequently can not get into my account! What a load of trash, this company has billions of dollars but can't even maintain a simple social networking app. Embarrassing.",1
"I used to really like this app. Now with the changes it is almost impossible to enjoy anything. The story change is the worst. Two rows instead of the one is just too much. Not everyone is interested in stories. But also making them HUGE so they take up half of the screen makes it just so annoying. Speaking of annoying. The new ""reels"" are unnecessary. They are just a cheap substitute for TikTok, that is annoying to begin with. Please remove them.",1
"My account has been blocked , i dont know what is happening with my account ,please give my accont back ,i have created two accounts but those are also blocked ,what should i do please give my account back",1
"I have two accounts, one personal and one for art. In both of them, I no longer see who I follow as frequently as I expect, instead pushing me sponsored ads and paid content I have no interest in. On the explore page, none of it is of interest, reels only shows me reposted content and videos I absolutely hate. In fact, I have been actively trying to hide content from the explore page that I don't want to see and it keeps popping up. Instagram really is going downhill, and it started around 2017. Awful up, no, downgrades have left me looking for a better photo sharing app.",1
"I Don't understand why in the list of people that is shown to send posts to, there is none of the people who are my common contacts. And no groups. No close friends. I can't send things to anyone anymore. Every update is worse. And if you look for them, they don't appear. Always with the "" Not found"" . I'm Very frustrated and disappointed in this app. I don't even use it as much anymore",1
"I've got an galaxy s8 and the stories on Instagram are always cropped so I can't read what people are writing, I've sent several reports to you and it doesn't seam to work.... I really like the app but some bugs are just there since forever!! Ps: my personal account don't have the questions as well, I've created another one for my band and I have it in there, I've tried connecting my account in another person's phone but it doesn't seam to work please fix this!!!",1
I've been using Instagram for years and I haven't had too many problems up untill yesterday when I decided to update the app. I've tried 9 times to post somthing and everytime while I'm adding photos and editing them it crashes. I'm getting really frustrated because I've never had this problem before and I don't know what to do,1
"I tried to upload a picture more than an hour ago and it still hasn't worked. It won't let me delete the attempt so now I can't log out/switch accounts ect until it's 'finished uploading' which it never will as I tried restarting the phone, cleaning the cache and updating Instagram. I think it's stupid to have to delete and reinstall an app in order for it to work it's too much hassle!!!",1
"Seriously, idk why Instagram doesn't seem to care for Android. Updates keep getting worse: opening Story mode shows black borders unless I switch to my other account and go back again, then it will be in full size. This hasn't been fixed, and now with the new update, I can't tap on the navigation bar (Home, Likes, etc.) unless I close and reopen the app. Searching for a specific user in my list shows Top accounts, none of which I'm following. I have to go through my list just to find them! WHY?",1
It gets crashed down every time I try to scroll down. So basically I can only view the first post on my feed list! It hangs! That's the worst thing of all! It hangs my phone and freezes the screen for minutes altogether! It's getting annoying to even operate it! I don't even think I should use it anymore!,1
"The app keeps crashing. It isn't able to refresh, nor is it capable of showing the message requests, even though I constantly have 9+ requests in the inbox. No recommendation whatsoever, until they get their act together. So I've got the latest update and none of the issues are fixed. Screw you, instagram",1
"Your UI UX has been only going downhill with all the recent updates. Moving the explore page and forcing reels down our throats, messages not going unless we quit and reopen the app, and now I can't watch videos in peace because Instagram decides I've seen enough and automatically scrolls me to the next one! And not to mention how the posts has to be alligned to the top of the screen! I can't have them in the middle of my screen or read a long caption, it always takes me to the next prev posts!",1
"I can't even see anything it's a black screen and I've tried everything and by that I mean yes.. EVERYTHING!! Updates, uninstalling, clearing the data and the cache but so far it has been showing 'couldn't refresh feed' for so many days now and I don't even know what's going on nor can I talk to my friends on the other side of the country!!! Thanks a lot Instagram you ruined everything at the wrong time!!!",1
'Your edit can't be saved. please try again' Seriously?! This is more than just annoying! I just want to edit the text to one of my pictures and I can't! I already logged out and in again and after that I tried to deinstall the app but even after I installed it again the bug stayed! I love the app but this is just really frustrating and annoying. Fix that please. Soon,1
"Maybe the app is good...I don't know. Signing up an account is absolutely horrible. I tried to create an account for the very first time, with 2 separate email addresses and was unable to. I followed the ridiculous arrangement to get it unlocked to no avail. Turns out this is a common complaint online yet nothing is being done. The Help centre is downright horrible and unhelpful. The customer care is the same.",1
"The latest roll of updates has totally ruined this app. I use it all the time and feel the new look is not user friendly. I hate that the most used features have been moved to the scrolling news page, both the button for me to make a new post and the likes notification. They should be on my dashboard on my home page. Where they were to begin with. Replaced with a sales button?? Get stuffed. I'm not interested. Also lots of ads I feel. Can't post tonight either,just crashes.",1
Camera filter very bad and app work very slow,1
"Whenever I download it ,it shows that your account is disabled and you have 30 days to disagree with decision what could it be",1
"What a nightmare, tried to turned off all ""push notifications"" by clicking ""off"" in all sections one by one, just to find out when I exit it they will be back on all the notifications. Tried to turn it off again, and same thing happen. Quite frustrated with this app's fixation of pushing notifications non-stop. Hence, I uninstalled the app.",1
"Please, why did the music application disappear from my Instagram account? thank you",1
"Instagram keeps crashing, it has been almost a week now, I've done everything, restarted phone, reinstalled the app, cleared cache, still nothing. After the most recent update, instagram has not been working at all. This so far is only affecting my business page. Very frustrating as this is where a lot of our customers communicate with us. Please find a fix asap",1
"Tried to sign up for an account. But the system showed that the email address and username were already in use. However when I used the forgot password option to try and recover it, the system said that the user does not exist. Sent a request through the help center to remove the email from the system. I received an email saying that once I reply to it, the email will be removed. Replied to it but didnt work. Very poor level of support. Disappointed even before I got a chance to use it!",1
"This app becomes pathetic day by day. Whenever I want to post any photo or video, it shows blank in my gallery, and from today, I can't see the share (+) option at the bottom of the app. Even when I want to post 2 photos together, one vertical and one horizontal, after selection it shows both the photos vertical. So, I decrease my rating from 4 to 1 and eagerly waiting for a good competitor app.",1
"I am unable to login in Instagram account. I have tried everything updated my android version, updated apk but It is still not working , It is just showing black screen when I am opening the Instagram app.",1
Blank Screen Issue - After I tried redownloading the app I have had a blank white screen for nearly 2 months. It worked for a week and then stopped again and I have tried all of their trouble shooting options. Not having any quick response to aid it from the team st Instagram. The new updates aren't working at all!!!!,1
What's wrong with the Instagram....from past few days I am unable to see any post. It just shows blank posts and it doesn't get load. Neither someone's profile picture is showing. They are all just blank .I have tried refreshing the page and also installing it again . I thought it might have some network issue or might be down but no it's not. It's happening from past few days and other apps are working fine.,1
"Pictures and videos are not showing on the app anymore. I already cleared cache many times but it didn't fixed the issue. I 'm afraid that if I uninstall then install the app back, I won't be able to log in again just like what happened with my bf's account. He couldn't retrieved it anymore as he was having the same issues like mine with the past few days. Please fix the system!",1
"What's wrong with my instaüò°. It's not opening evendo net is super fastüò°üò°. At first I thought it could have happened due to server's failure, so I waited for many days but it all went in vain üò°. Then I decided to uninstalled it and reinstall it from play store, but same problem happened againüò°. Dear insta team try to resolve this problem as soon as possible.üò°",1
"Hate it. I've been having an issue for soooo long and i never get an answer at all!! Update January 18th 2021: Every time I'm starting love this app it does something that makes me frustrated all over again. I have 2 accounts, a private one and an art one. I can use any artist and their music on my art account but I can only use ringtone type music on my personal. Anything I look for in the search bar come up as ""No Results Found"". It's so annoying. Please help me enjoy this app fully.",1
"The new update is just so horrible. The videos pause without a reason. I'm not getting all the notifications. Also, the instagram gallery is showing blank pictures. I have to post through the phone gallery,which is pretty much inconvenient. The recent update has nothing but bugs in it. I've never faced too many issues in the app. I love Instagram... PLEASE DO NOT SPOIL IT AND FIX THE BUGS!",1
Fix the damn themes in the dms!! They won't stay & screen goes back to black.,1
"I keep trying to sign in, but I just get a ""dismiss"" button pop up every time I do, without telling me what the issue is. I've tried deleting & re-downloading the app, re-starting my phone, clearing my history. Nothing will make it work. I've tried contacting the developer as well & haven't heard back.",1
The new version is horrible. Been trying to login for the past 72hours but my screen goes blanküò≠. Installed it over 10times still nothing!! üöÆ FIX THIS BECAUSE I HAVE A BUSINESS PAGE TO MAINTAIN WITH CONSISTENCY haiii,1
It's actually disappointing that ig has refused to send me a code n I've failed to sign up n it's heart breaking üíîüíîüíî,1
"Won't let me open. Every time I open the app, it closes out on me. I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it, I've only logged into 1 account at a time and nothing works. Stupid.",1
Its not logging in I'm sure my username and password is correct but its not logging in I'm still logged in pc and idk what to do,1
"Damn!!... It's not showing the option of save reel, plz enable the option!!!",1
"This app sucks now. They put suggestions for content in your main feed essentially making it a second explore page. Also, they made browsing somebody's account very inconvenient. Everytime you view a photo and return to the account's gallery, it puts you back to the beginning. The new direction is now meant for you to consume as much content possible instead of curating your feed.",1
"Well it was fine until, i want to open a new business account. Instagram ain't sending me the verification code LOL",1
Getting Worse To Worse After every update. Not showing online friends Not refreshing feed.,1
Please improve chat active showing option because sometimes a person is inactive but his/her account show active for upto 7 minutes So please improve it .,1
"It isn't even letting me login from my other device I have put everything right password, username everything but it's not logging in",1
"I gave only one star because when I'm send a story that time I can't music was coming so I don't want like this app so I give only 1star so, don't download this app _THANK YOU_",1
As of the update done 2 days ago the app opens & shuts down immediately - please investigate & advise me... Many thanks in advance üôÇ,1
No new updates after updating. Quickly checking and solved pls nxt update properly changed the problems,1
Instagram is just a step away from changing its name to tiktok first add reels to it n now removed igtv from app in some days Instagram ll be changed tiktok official......,1
It's not good because there are soo many problems in my account and now it was not showing any bodies thoughts aur no I'd is loggin,1
On the z flip 3 the app runs terribly storys are half the size of my screen so upsetting,1
"This is horrible. Instagram DOES NOT work for Android. Such a huge company and yet incredible amount of bugs in the app. From stories, messages, posts. Literally in everything there is an option that doesn't work. What's up with message recordings being slowed down? Not able to upload stories... I could go on and on. My account doesn't even have new font for stories. Shame on you, honestly. What is the point of having an app if one can't even use it?!",1
"**UPDATE** App worked again for about 2 weeks - than a month later has done a full crash again. Garbage. Haven't been able to refresh feed for almost a month. Already cleared the cache and the data. No updates to be found. Honestly just might delete Instagram- the new updates to the upload function are garbage. I never want to upload to my story, but that's all I was able to upload too for a while, it over-rode the create a post function. App has gone severely down in in last 3 weeks.",1
"This app has a lot of bugs. Sometimes when I call someone the screen is all black and I have to restart the phone because the call doesn't stop, neither the phone ringing. Also, when I call I can't see the camara of the other person (it's all black AGAIN) even though they tell me that they have the camera open. In addition, sometimes I can see the the story bubble on some profiles even though I have seen them already. The stories are glitchy too.",1
So nice filter and effect. Nice reel to art's . i favourite app is instagram. Instagram is so so so so nice.okey i like instagram.to cute filter and effect and cool filter and effect,1
"Literally the worst UI update I've ever seen in my life! Please bring back the old layout! The new tiktok/reel like layout is not only annoying but also really and I mean REALLY inaccessible for neurodivergent people. It's so difficult to read the captions as they're directly on top of the pictures. Not to forget how frustrating (and ironic) it is to not be able to ""scroll"" freely on a social media app! Absolute bonkers.",1
"I have been having a bug for the past month. When I try to open the posts that people send me on DM, the app takes me to the homepage instead of the post. It's really frustrating. I already cleared the data, uninstalled and installed the app again and it's still happening. Please, help me fix this. Once I click the post, whether is a picture or a video, it takes me back to the homepage, so I cannot se what people send me. Thank you!",1
I have reported a problem and still it's nkt solved There's alot of bugs I am not able to add music to my stories or even to post,1
Every 4 posts there's an ad sometimes even 2 posts so you get mote ads than posts you want,1
"I have Instagram for Android and I'm now redownliading it for the umpteenth time because it won't refresh or loaf any content when I 100% for sure have internet and data that work for other apps. This happens so often, it also crashes and some of the features just don't even make sense like by slightly touching the top of the screen it scrolls all the way to the top of the reels I'm watching causing me to lose my spot and having to refresh again. Just so many inconvenient things",1
My account got disabled for no reason ppl who violate community guidelines u don't take any actions. But a simple girl with a account u PPL desable without any mistakes. And when I try to login u PPL without sending any opt to my number decide that I have exhausted my chances. This is completely unexpecteble. Insta has gone downhill and disables account without any reasons and this is not only with me it has happened with many others . Instagram u have to take appropriate actions about this,1
To much tough features restrictions try again later etc to much difficult app,1
App is getting stuck after getting updated.,1
"Before I upgraded from a note 8 last month. I couldn't respond to messages. Properly as the send airplane wasn't even there. Now that ive upgraded my phone to the s22. It doesn't want to notify me properly that someone messaged me. I hear the notification. See the red 1, but have to go in and out of the messaging screen to make the message appear. Used to be my fav app. But patience is running thin on this one. I've restarted phone. Everything is up to date. And reinstalled the app IG please fix",1
"I am really irritated with the ad where a guy speaks he doesn't have time but asks us to give money on his telegram, it shows even after marking not interested and spam repeatedly FIX THIS üòí",1
"Absolute trash. Tried to upload a new profile picture and it will only load the first 10 pictures on my device. I restarted my device, reinstalled the app, and tried a different internet connection multiple times each. It shows that there are other pictures there, just won't show or select them. The UI is jank as hell too. I thought snapchat was bad...",1
Instagram and Facebook are supposed to be completely separate. Putting me in Facebook jail means Facebook only and not Instagram. #DeleteFacebook #DeleteInstagram,1
"I cannot get instagram to access my camera via the plus button. It only let's me upload photos from my albums. It's been like this for months. I've tried logging out, reinstalling, clearing the cache. I've reported the bug several times with no response. This makes the app pretty pointless if I can't take photos with it. That fault rectrified itself after several months. But now it's saying photo can't be posted and then keeps the error displayed without being able to clear it.",1
Been trying to log into my account the whole day. Keep seeing a message about my username not existing üò≠üò†. Really really bad experience.,1
This app totally frestrating without any your mistake he disable your id and when he need to verify you and verify your documents and you provide all your documents what he need he forget for again enable and no problem how much you try for contacting him he not reply your any message and you realise that you do mistake for make a account on this app.ü§¨ü§¨üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°,1
Wrost app ever. I use dramatic cloud in my video but boom when i upload it is vanish .its showing that i use that filter but in video filter is not applied ...nice insta very nice just delte your app from playstore,1
"The Era of Instagram is shortly coming to an end. New features and tools won't change the numerous amounts of bugs and lags. Thinking of changing my messaging experience to another app. Overall, I think it is all about it's name and not the experience you can get in comparison with other applications when talking about texting and lots of adds!!!",1
Very bad app. Girls always block me whenever I talk them. Either send them friend request they reject me. Please delete two options (reject and block) first.üò¢üò¢ Thank you.,1
"Instagram although a nice app, the recent changes are horrible. The shopping tab replaced the post interaction one and I hate it, I check those like crazy and now it's harder to. The reels and igtv button replaced the post button which is now also harder to access which is also bad. The algorithm does not work for artists which I see alot of on Instagram. I'm also an artist on Instagram and it's hard to do much with the current algorithm. Insta needs to fix these issues.",1
"Instagram was great until it added reels (an exact copy of tik tok, which isn't surprising as Instagram often tries to copy other social media platforms), I get distracted by them so easily and the content isn't even interesting, currently there is no way to turn them off. I am probably going to delete Instagram until the ability to turn off reels is added.",1
I haven't been able to access the reels feature since it was rolled out last year. There's just no option. The reels appear as posts. I've always updated the app and even tried the beta version. No assistance of any kind was provided despite numerous bug reports. Uninstalling the app because I'm DONE!!,1
Good app but now it is bad app When i loginig my account insta asking Eight digit backup code but i am setuped Two factors aunthenification so what I can do plzzzzz help me,1
"I am disappointed with the application. Today, using insta as always, at some point I couldn't comment on the post, then I couldn't publish stories, then I couldn't send messages to my friends and now it only shows me a black screen or it writes something like: unable to refresh or error. Fix it up and maybe I'll give it a higher rating. I am totally disappointed and pissed. I don't want to lose that acc, it's important for me",1
"This app has lots of issues wrt to chat. When I type the 2nd line i couldn't see the 1st line, and couldn't tap on send or give enter. For that I should always come out from the chat and open it again. I'm not facing these issues with any other apps. It always shows me active, even though I'm not online. Frequently, crashing even after update. Horrible app hv bn facing these issues for a long while Idk what the app developers r doing. Instead of bringing new features. Pls look into existing bugs",1
"1. Instagram keeps crashing for no reason. 2. Reels layout is so annoying. You have to go into reels view mode to play a video for the second time. 3. Suggested posts. Why do you keep adding pointless & annoying features? I followed accounts for a reason, and the explore page is there for a reason. 4. Littered with ads. You get IG story ads every 2 accounts. 5. Everytime I redownload Insta, there are so many ""tutorial"" pop-ups and you can't turn them off. They're so annoying.",1
My messages are not open and account is not working suddenly it's stopped so I'm not happy with insta,1
"Continual regression in quality seen at each and every update. Now unable to mute and unmute videos on the fly, tapping a video now places it into an unwanted full screen mode entirely separate from reels, rather than just muting it as it did before. Only way of muting these new full screen 'videow' is if you enter a reel and toggle the sound through that. Clueless as to why reels now dictate the volume of normal video posts. Very unimpressed. Nobody asked for this change. Revert it.",1
Well.. Instragram would work better before. but now I am having many problems. Its soo irritating and annoying. It doesn't show the messages I have received. It shows the notification of me receiving the messages and when I open it in app it shows my old messages and nothing new. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app many times now. Fix it.,1
"You seriously need to sort out the problem when watching insta videos!! There's a horrible pixelation after a couple of secs then lasts for a while before it's clear. There obviously seems to be an ongoing issue, as it looks like I'm not the only experiencing this problem. Even the last update hasn't changed anything!",1
"Hey Instagram! I can't view my older saved photos, I could see all of them a year ago. I've been saving photos since the SAVE feature was introduced to Instagram. The saved photo that is showing as the last photo was saved on 4th July of 2019, but I'm saving photos since 2017. FIX THIS ISSUE ASAP INSTAGRAM. I don't see the point of saving photos when I can't even view them.",1
"Please sort out all the fake Jason mamoa , Keanu reeves , Katy Perry pages! There's now people pretending to be their online managers as well! I've just deleted a ton of messages . They are all following me ! Please just look at my followers on craftywoo333 . At least 30 fake famous people! Sort it out! It reminds me of that year we all had the porn followers!",1
"This app is getting worse with every update! My explore page is full of random posts that have nothing to do with the posts I usually like or with the accounts I'm following, filters started to disappear and now I can't take any pictures for my stories anymore because the filter I was always using is gone, the way reels are working is annoying because when I tap the screen I want to mute the reel, not to make it bigger and the music feature is not working for the pics/vids I send to someone.",1
"Horrible app, constantly adding updates that further ruin the platform, notes being the most recent.",1
"My four-year-old Instagram account evaporated from existence with no violations or explanation and no opportunity for recourse, let alone a phone number to call for assistance. Why should I ever trust this platform again?",1
I'm troubling form 2 months Instagram was not showing proper massages and chats nt working properly. Please fix this.,1
"I don't know what is wrong with the app, its always denying me from logging into my account. That it doesn't exist",1
When on a call on messenger I can't use Instagram as it crashes my phone. Sort this out.,1
"Sometimes i don't get messages that are clearly there, but get notifications for them - earlier chats take forever to load or don't load at all - certain posts are unlikable - the algorithm is messy and favours the wrong stuff - almost none of the music i listen to is available, the synergy of Instagram and Soundcloud is non existent. Also, focus on your app being used for photosharing! Not reels! This isn't tiktok and it shouldn't be. +Haven't been able to post any captions for about a month.",1
I've been having this problem where I put a song in my stories and when I see the highlight of it it just doesn't play the music. Or when my account doesn't have the new things that the new update has. Yes I updated insta. And the reels are over and over the same again just like the suggested posts. Please fix this. Thank you.,1
"Every time I open the app, it loads a post, then that post dissapears below a bunch of new posts. EVery time that happens I'm closing the app. Fix it",1
Zuck share post on Instagram about the new feature Notes and i have this feature before update and after update this feature not showing üòÇ,1
"I update this and still haven't received the Note feature, I have an Android 15",1
It's starting to shadow ban so many accounts its not even worth posting on here anymore unless you have a business account and you are going to pay for your reach. So done with this app sticking with tiktok,1
Instagram is an perfect app and help younger grew up with they business online,1
funny_memes42084 This was my another Instagram account I forgot the password and now I want to reset the password but whenever I try I don't get any OTP on my mobile number,1
The explore page keeps on showing irrelevant contents,1
Crashes constantly and won't let me edit pictures in posts with more than one photo,1
I am facing so much problem regarding Instagram acc login. I recently changed my mobile and I am trying to login my account in my new phone but they are not sending OTP.. and they not giving any solution also for this problem Instagram getting worst app day by day,1
"Most worst app since last 4,5 months i can't find Hindi, Punjabi and others songs only i got here English songs üò§üòï",1
Friends that tag me in things now goes straight to messages which is terrible i hope they u do whatever they did instagram is starting to suck. Please fix this asap!,1
I cant able to use properly there are sooo many bugs and its not properly wrking,1
"So many technical problems, way too many bots, won't remove scam, nutidy or gore accounts",1
"Cannot make reels- have cleared cache, uninstalled and reinstalled. Still not working",1
"The app isnt optimized properly. I have few accounts logged in to my device and each account shows different feature. Kindly look into this issue, it is very irritating",1
"I can't login, every time I want to log in it always says ""please wait a few minute and try again""",1
"Coming back to do another review. Okay, so again, those bugs still aren't fixed, anytime you go to upload something it either fails, and I've tried using mobile data and WiFi connection. Most of the time, your only option is to log into the website every single time, which gets very annoying. A new recouring bug that happens is the: ""Can't refresh feed"" error messege. This hasn't only happened to me too, so this is Instagrams fault. Please, and I mean please fix these issues.",1
My phone Instagram is not working I'm still waiting for 3 days plz sir fix this glitch I'm using Instagramlite is very poor experience,1
Chat Bugs Can You Fix this My chat List gotta Stuck everytime I can't do With Anyone new Update Have New Type of Glitch this Is To annoying,1
I've never written a negative review...but Instagram makes me wanna scream in agony. IGTV upload app doesn't let remove the preview from the grid neither before nor after the video is uploaded. I may live with it in the grid and tried adding a slide with a frame (I have grid frames which are visually connected) to the video - it's not centered and 'choose the cover' option is really useless as it is not square and you can't be sure it will match the previous frame on the grid... User-friendly?!,1
Reply to msg option is not ter..notification doesn't showup fast..,1
"obviously, in the search page, there are lots of girls' posts and videos showing breast , so i really hate thiss..........ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ",1
"Reels are broken af. About half of them work fine, but the other half just turn black 2 seconds after you start watching them. And if I upload them to my story, the reel just paises where it would turn black (also no sound on these). And it's specific reels. I once tried rewatching a broken reel i saw months ago and guess what, still broken. Also new feature: Instagram stopped working on my phone. Lovely.",1
Instagram no response when I report a problem and doesn't even fix the problem I don't like this app now bcz it doesn't work properly üò°üò°,1
I have updated but still I haven't received the updated features. I hate this app now a days,1
"When I actually need the reels to work, they don't. Can't upload one reel across any of my devices and the option to upload just randomly disappears until I clear cache again but still doesn't want to upload a reel. Just checked on someone else's phone, reels work perfectly fine and can upload but as soon as I login it doesn't work. Instagram doesn't seem to like my account. Wonderful; Top notch, thank you very much.",1
"Disabled my account says get sms code they never sent code tried again said too many codes sent wait 24 hours yet I never received one single code checked server all good do not disturb off internet connection perfect even tried on mobile data Nothing . If i ever get back in will be deleting this account and will NEVER use Instagram heres their message to me Hi sabapequori, It looks like your account was disabled by mistake. Your account has been reactivated. Seriously ?",1
It's suck ! after update I can't see my own highlights and keep showing loads !,1
Instagram suspended Hindu pages without any reason. So I'm giving 1 star here. And also you can change it's name to islamgram. So the next time we will create our own app.,1
Typing experience not good showing glitch... Like she send msgs but show me later,1
This app is the worst. There is no customer service whatsoever. Everything is for ads or for profit.,1
The message notification is too slow. This is irritating! Before some days i was able to pause and skip the reels using the running point but now I'm not able to do so! And during some periods of time it was able to arrange the background photo while sharing a post! And that was so nice but now intagram removed that option. This is soo irritating. Please do the needed. This is still my favorite app Do the needed,1
"Feels like this is some basic level app made just for some school assignment purpose. Too many bugs and no heeding of reports. One of the irritating ones, followers keep on decreasing automatically (they are not unfollowing themselves).",1
"When I open the Instagram app, I cannot see reels, post etc. What will appear in my screen is color white and nothing more. Please help me to fix this issue.",1
"All my friends can put a 30second story but not me, why??? Even though i just updated my Instagram and i have Android 12 üôÑüôÑ",1
"Instagram is one of the best application. I am using is since long however these day I am facing an issue while posting. I. If I post a story it shows ""posting"" till 6-8+ hours but doesn't work out and I have to restart to get rid of that notofication. II. I cannot upload a reel. When it is a preview time, it stucks there. III. Similarlly, normal photo post has the same issue. Overall, when it comes to post anything, instagram doesn't work. Hoping that this bug will get fixed sooonnn.!! ü§û",1
"Why does app now force me to post videos as reels >""< ? i dont like it. Btw, after choose pics & vids to post, i dont see the bin to drag photo into it anymore? Where the Bin?",1
My followers cannot reshare my stories when I tag them. I have all the correct settings updated and have enabled the resharing button. Instagram does not get back to me about this issue.,1
It cant be opened. Its warning: there is a bug in this app !!! When will you fix it?,1
Suspended and deleted my account for nothing after the latest update. No response from support. Pretty neat.,1
Had to download this because the web app message feature doesn't work. Awesome.,1
I have been trying to switch my account to professional but it says there is a problem and it is being solved but it really has not been solved because i always trt it again and again nothing happens,1
"Not working properly after update, so deleting it would be a good option.",1
Worst... Always showing ads after scrolling one or two post,1
"Things have been fine with this app until these past few months. But now I've encountered these problems: 1. I always have problems uploading stories, and have to uninstall and reinstall for a *chance* of it to work again. 2. This time however, reinstalling absolutely removes my close friends option. It doesn't even exist anymore. I want it back.",1
"Just admit that facebook is getting desperate and maybe people wil ltake pity when insta makes garbage decisions like adding an entire row of ads followed by accounts you don't follow on your main page. Stop doing so many stupid things all at once, maybe? Or just accept your fate. Either or.",1
Not much security. My account has been hacked 2 times already. Poor security.,1
The new scrolling style annoyed the hell out of me. Because of the auto update s**t i can't even go back to previous version. Instagram is the app where i spend most of my time so I'm really upset. And they don't even fix the problem of saved files stucking when you find a place to save and you have to go to setting to load every file again and again to appear on the bar.,1
Some inappropriative I'ds like my story everyday and i request to Instagram please stop this nonsense I'ds but Instagram doesn't take any action so i give 1 star only they deserve üôè,1
"It was an awesome app until it started crashing everytime I try to upload pictures. It's so annoying when you finish selecting all 10 pictures, finish tagging everyone & writing the entire caption, it just crashes without even saving a draft of the work. & Not just once, it literally happened 8-10 times! Please fix it soon.",1
There app is quite poor and if you've problems good look getting it solved or even a response.,1
Bad applicationüòíwhen i comment someones video I can't use GIF like Facebook and when i likes the someones comment i can't use lol emoji or other emojies like fb please solve this problem on the next updateüò≠üôè,1
"Why is you name instagram. Change the name to bugstagram.If can't handle this app stop running it.can u please look after the glitch . If i click on a particular reels video , Instagram dont open that. I have to close and open insta 10 times. And guess what instagram don't open reels videos wow what a update. Please look and solve this problem üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª yrr ye instagram h ya bugs ki duniya yrr ye reels kyu nhi chl rhi had h yrr üò°üò°",1
Scrolling now snaps on a per post basis in the latest update. So you can no longer scroll past multiple posts with a single flick of the finger. Forcing you to scroll by ads manually. Sending pictures and videos via messaging from your gallery compresses them terribly. The new layout sometimes covers the bottom text of the video with the video description. Wheras before the description was not overlayed on top of the post you'd be viewing. This was the final kick I needed to delete the app.,1
"In my instagram account,Chat session is totally freezed and i dont able to recieve messages from any one,One of the worst problem i faced.",1
It became worst app it is not allowing to follow and continuous likes before it was very good app compare to all apps,1
"It freezes all the time, so annoyingüôÉ",1
"worst app operation in India, so many bugs while editing creating even on surfing not eligible for 1 star also",1
"Big company trying to copy the success of another big company but doesn't have the agility to do so, while in the process destroying what their core audience was there for, no protection against scam bots, also allows for scam adverts that you'll have to report yourself and at the moment their failed attempt to copy tiktok has them forcing vids on you (I got like 10~ in a row) despite you being on mobile networks basically eating up your data quota",1
Too many glitches after the update and doesn't show new followers or following in its section,1
Instagram is a perfect example of how a social app should be like .. i recommend you download it and enjoy the life of celebs and friends,1
"Have been using this app for years, but is now just rubbish. Doesn't save pictures to the app, so you can't even try to download them. When it does work for like 5 minutes you save a few pictures, and then download every time there's an ad. See you later. Was good when it worked. But now 98% of the time it doesn't work. Can use an app that doesn't work",1
"The main problem that I hate about the app is that the stories are being split into many halves,,,, As of new update we can put max 90sec story but the bug is that I can put only 15sec,,, please solve this issue.",1
"No support for account recovery... It's been 15 days and numerous emas sent, my account was phished and asked for support and no response at all..",1
"Absolute garbage. Posts are all mixed up together, it's impossible to see them in chronological order, I keep seeing posts from 2 days ago together mixed with new ones, what a terrible mess. PLUS this app is slow, I can't scroll down the search/explore section. It doesn't load, ever! I wouldn't recommend instagram to anyone these days.",1
Why my Instagram is not working properly and it's working like instagram lite not working properly and even after installing again n again,1
My followers are decreasing day by day but I post reels stories regularly please check this issue. thank you.,1
I am very disappointed with Instagram story time limit......its time is too short please increase Instagram story time limit,1
"Extremely buggy. For some reason, it uploads automatically full, over 1 minute videos as reels, cutting them short and giving you no way to upload videos as regular posts. Uploading videos as reels leads to them being squashed for some reason, so can't do that either. Only fix is to reinstall but it soon switches back to reels-only. Instagram gives you no choice in this.",1
I am unable to see Access Data under security..,1
"Really hate the new update to the feed. The way it scrolls is awkward, the colours that border a post are NOT aesthetically pleasing, and it is much more difficult to read captions. Instagram, WHY? I much preferred the clean white borders around images and the smooth scrolling. That design considered form and function. Bring it back!",1
"Instagram is getting worse day by day. I have a quote account which is a public account. I'm unable to add songs to my stories. It simply shows, this song is currently unavailable (actually the enitre Playlist is unavailable). Secondly, earlier my posts used to get a good reach, but since this pendamic started, my reach has gone real down, which is kinda demotivating. Idk why is this happening. Please try to fix this issue as soon as possible. Thank you.",1
"Some stories don't fit to some phones... in some phones you can't even see half the story from right to left... just make them fit to every phone or just cut some of the screen on some phones... Also I have like 3 accounts... and all 3 of them have different interfaces like.... why? just let us have an option that we can choose from a classic interface, newest interface and the simple interface...",1
For the past month stories have been slow to skip (delay after tap) and for long stories that take multiple slots audio and video do not match up. I will scroll through my feed and it will say I am caught up even if I've been away for a day or two. Very irritating as your advertisements seen to be working without audio/visual errors.,1
"App routinely breaking. Used to be really clean and relatively bug-free, now the app is constantly broken or buggy. Videos will not load or play despite uninstalling and reinstalling. This has happened intermittently for months with updates occasionally fixing it for a few days. There is at least one significant broken feature in the app at any given time.",1
It stops working suddenly after updating to new version,1
"I really used to like Instagram, and to some extent still do, the way I traditionally used it for a long time. As a photo and video Sharing app. The algorithms and all the ads every other second are extremely frustrating, making my experience with Instagram now just flat out annoying and not pleasurable. We should be able to choose what we want to see and not what Instagram's algorithms 'think' our interests are. If Instagram could at least gives us back that liberty, IG can be good again.",1
"I'm not too sure am I the only one experiencing this situation but ever since the new update, I can't post multiples in one post. Especially, boomerangs. I can only able to post one boomerang in one post. Which sucks. Everytime I want to post something, it'll either ""unable to edit"" or ""couldn't post"".

Edit: this new trial ""reshare sticker"" thing is very inconvenient. It was way better and much easier to such simply tap on the share option and reshare the thing on the story.

Slow-mo videos appear in the preview while selecting. Once you move to the post now button it reverts to full speed 3. While viewing a post with videos, it appears as a photo in the scrolling tab. One has to goto the main gallery and click the post again to show as a video ???",1

"The new Instagram has a lot of issues that makes it not a user-friendly app. A- cannot wide screen videos that are 1 minute. B - cannot select pictures at one go. Have to repeat the selection process on second go. C- Have to use different apps to fit in the video to screen, which wasn't the case earlier. Please look into this. This is so unnecessary",1
"I've sent an e-mail regarding this already, but I've been having issues uploading pictures to my story. Currently, one of the two posts I've attempted to add to my story has been ""posting"" for almost 24 hours. This isn't the first time I've had this issue. Both my phone and app are up to date. Instagram is my preferred platform for Social Media, and these issues are making the app frustrating to use.",1
It getting worst by upadates can't login . Always error occured .something went wrong,1
"don't know what happened to insta. suddenly everytime I post or create a story it doesn't let me choose pictures / videos from my photos and I don't have a full storage. plus effects doesn't work, even saving effects! and seriously, the reason why I don't like facebook because of it's messaging method and now ig syncs message to messenger as well???good gracious. I'm done.",1
"Such a ""big"" app without a real help center. Someone that can help you with bugs, false reports etc. Inexcusable. Also, there are so many bugs that haven't been fixed for months! Fonts in stories work one day, they don't the next day. Specific old posts are stuck in my home page and I keep seeing them for days. They need to actually work a lot to make it a decent app.",1
"Using this on my Galaxy S20+. There's this incredibly annoying habit from the app to play videos that are only partially visible at the bottom of the screen while I'm reading/watching the post above it -even the post above it if fully visible and on the screen. Worst yet, it automatically scrolls down whenever a video is over, which I hate either way. Another frustrating thing is, when I read long captions of certain posts, the app jumps to the next post when I scroll to read more.",1
"Last update completely ruined the use of effects on Stories. The new effects browser doesn't actually let me use any of them. When I click ""try it"" it just goes back to the stories main frame like the effect it's loading, the dots dissapear after a while but nothing happens and then it won't let me take pics of videos or even use other effects. Not good.",1
"The pictures are somehow going very blurry, not only the pictures but also the videos that you are willing to share.Even if you take it by your own phone's camera or you take it on the apps camera. Somehow the result never changes in the end and some of my friends even thought that it was their phones problem but not at all.The other thing that must be changes is that how the page re-news itself when you looking at the pictures of a profile. You have to go down and down again. Nonsensical BUGS",1
"I cannot believe the 'save draft' option has been taken away.. if you have to put your phone down for a few minutes, or you quickly jump to another app, when you attempt to continue editing your photos to post, you lose everything and have to stay over again! What a bloody joke! This goddamn app gets worse with every update!",1
"I have used this apps for years and it was really good. But over these 2 weeks I couldnt record any video from story. Everytime i record it always say ""something went wrong,please try again"" it is really annoying. i have tried to clean cache, uninstalling for many times, restart my phone, updating my phone and it still not work. Please fix this bugs.",1
"Everything is about iPhone. I'm having a bug where I have 3 messages unread(that are read) all the time when I switch the accounts. It's a little annoying. A time consuming app. Can't listen to all the music in stories. When I edit a post, I can't delete specific photos(not all but just some) As for the good: memes, I can like messages, I can video call using masks",1
"You've ruined it. It's a massive ballache finding anything now you've moved everything around. It won't show comments and likes, it freezes, it crashes. The changes make it more difficult to navigate. Instead of clicking once to go direct to my comment, I have to click 2 or more, same as when I post, I click to post and the stupid reels thing opens up instead. Before the update you could post, check comments, look at your page, look at your feed with a single click. Now it's ruined. Well done.",1
"I have been bothered by ads, every time I want to watch a video, ads will appear ,. So I had to wait about 15 seconds before watching again, as you can see, if that was my first video, so what about the other videos I wanted to watch. When I watch an interesting video, then at that moment an ad appears. So the feeling of watching a video is gone ..",1
"I don't know how this app got so popular. it sucks so much! 1) you can't post photos of multiple sizes and the whole point of the picture goes away many-a-time 2)I use a Pixel 2 and backup photos to the cloud. the app doesn't let me pick photos from my cloud storage without going through all the images I've ever uploaded, or downloading all the ones that I want, one by one and then creating an album 3) There's no option to get my older albums on it via a deaktop environment",1
I'm enable to select my own choice song for my story and it's happening from more over 6 days hope will be fine soon...,1
"The primary feature of this app is to let you post photos of moments in your life that you want to share, but it's been more than 4 months now the app won't allow me to post anything I kept retrying yet still end up with the same message ""your photo wasn't posted"". Already unistalled and reinstalled it, cleared the cache and updated it, still the same error message. The only way I can post is through a browser.",1
I m facing issues since 1 week. I cannot refresh new posts n new reels after opening the app.,1
Too many ads. Hard to see my following's post anymore because of these ads.,1
Having huge issues with the app ever since I made and linked a second account. Nothing will upload on my new account (even after deleting and re-installing the app). I can't switch to my original account as I'm unable to log out while a post is uploading (although it never does). The app keeps opening and then just closing before it has even loaded. Hopefully Instagram can fix these issues soon.,1
"For the last few days the app just doesnt respond at all. Like other people, the ""couldnt refresh feed"" problem i have encountered here too, but now, if i go into the app it takes ages to load and when it boots up its just a blank screen with cutouts for stories and posts, and thats not even the worst, i cant even interact with anything in the app, none of the buttons work. The app is basically a $h!tty screensaver. The web version works fine though. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP UNTIL IT IS FIXED",1
Photo upload options is disgusting.. Couldn't cover my whole photo in one frame,1
Any time you go to edit a reel it crashes...,1
App keeps holding in pixel 6a. Not loading content sometimes,1
Terrible app no support. Get hacked that's it done. Useless processes to recover. Joke.,1

Needs A update cause messages don't show up until a day later or disappear,1
Many bugs after this update my account can't run on slow network,1
"Do you have a complaint? Were you trying to share some wholesome memes? Don't worry because Instagram is a safe place and will make sure to shadowban you and reject your account from getting engagement unless you post nudity or suicide photos. Because unless you post nudity, you won't get verified. Thats how safe and fair Instagram is to users. And dont worry because support will definitely respond to you.",1

"It's ridiculous. russians massively report harmless posts of Ukrainians (for example the photo of Ukrainian passport or simply post in Ukrainian) and they get deleted or blocked for ""breaking"" the guidelines. However, when Ukrainians report real hate speech from russians, Instagram team does nothing. They wait for a couple of days and get back, saying that their team had no time to review this complaint. Absolutely ridiculous! UPD: Instagram team does absolutely nothing about the reports.",1

"Absolutely awful, before they started it to be basically Snapchat it was great but as well as this some security and hair handling has gone wrong. I had an account which was great nothing wrong with it and loved the app. Until a few months ago when I got hacked 22 times in like 2 weeks!! This is awful. So much of 3 times on one day! I had to change my password so many times it was ridiculous so I got in contact with customer services explaining the issue and that I do not intend to be changing any name,password or email so they said they'd sort it. Of which this means they no longer sent me emails when things on the account changed so I decided to delete that account and make a whole fresh one. Even though I lost all my followers, likes and photos i wasn't too bothered about that until a further few weeks when I got hacked another 4 times and I now can't get back onto that account either. I've tried emailing and nobody replies. It's caused so much stress to me so I'm just deleting it now. I think it's awful. Do not recomend at all",1

After that i tried to reset the password by requesting a email confirmation but for some reason i couldnt find my email there and then i tried to write a support ticket but these useless individuals didn't even bother to create a support team to look at the tickets. Long story short I didn't get my account back",1
My account got suspended for no reason. My few posts are all cosplays and they barely show any skin besides arms \(‚Ä¢-‚Ä¢)/ I don't get how there are actual bad accounts that have been open longer than mine but those ones haven't been taken down yet despite reports.,1

Instagram used to be about pictures and creating themes to make your account cool. I don't see any of my friends and it's basically a reboot of tiktok and Amazon. I don't want to see random influencers and recently I seen women just half naked like if Instagram just went back to pictures I'd use it more but now its pretty trash,1
"This App is garbage ... I used a 3rd party app that may have tried to hack my account, and when I tried to recover my account with my email, Instagram eventually makes you do a selfie verification video to prove your actually a real person..yet..once I take the selfie video ,I keep getting emails from Instagram saying that they can't confirm I'm a real person ..so I can't get into my old account even with the proper email ,even with resetting the password, even with using the 6 digit code!!B.S.",1
70% of the messages do not appear unless I refresh the chats tab but every time I refresh the chats tab every group dissappears from it and it's so irritating,1

Just joining the chorus telling you it suddenly stopped working days ago due to a bug from the last update. My current version is 249.0.0.20.105 I can't get past the loading screen before it blinks out. How about an update to fix this issue?,1
I like ig bt after the last update there's a bug in create story option . I have given all the permission bt still it wants permission of storage and microphone. I can't create any reel or any story. Plz fix the bug,1
Instagram was beautiful but now it is pathetic it forces you to see reels if u like any particular content your feed will be full of those content no customisation at all and if u give not interested like that still it forces you show more posts and reels related to that content mainly it chooses the thing what you have to see not you..,1
What was once a fun photo sharing app and some video sharing has turned into a wannabe TikTok. I don't have a TikTok account nor do I want one. So thanks for the fun while it lasted because this transition to be more like TikTok has me ready to delete this app.,1
"This app is impossible to reset my search history despite telling it 1000x I don't want to see this anymore. Also, the colors shift randomly, making it difficult to use.",1
I was watching my draft reels which I saved to post later but suddenly my videos stopped opening then Instagram closed by itself then I opened it again and went to search for my draft videos but there was no videos all videos are gone I didn't understand what happened and still now I haven't got my videos back I want it back worst experience,1
"My experience with Instagram has been almost solely awful and annoying and I cannot overstate my growing hate for the people running it. You cannot call, reports are not handled or taken by bots with no understanding and that don't help, you cannot email, and their website offers only complaints on pre-determined problems. You can't make a unique complaint. This app is nothing short of garbage",1
"These idiots deleted my account and I had to restart from basically scratch. Total arse Years later and the app is no better. Still constantly violating your privacy, still breaks at least once a month. Seriously you're better off with Twitter now Elon owns it",1
"App keeps closing, please look into this. Reinstalled it and didn't fix the issue.",1
This recent update has totally ruined my experience. App is not responding again and again. Search options not working in App. App crashes too frequently. Have a look into this matter ASAP.,1
"My instagram won't load message. I get notification that people dm me, but when i open it, there's nothing and i can't load",1
"Why can't I sign in? I noticed that i can't log in into an existing account and then i uninstalled my insta because last time i fixed the problem by uninstalling it. When I opened it, i couldn't even get into my account...no icons, no sign in bottons. Only black screen! Fix it immediately, please!!!",1
Blank screen appears as I open the app and can't login. Worst experience. Tried re-installing it since last 2 weeks but the didn't get fixed till now.,1
"Sucks!!! I unistalled this app and upon uploading it again there's nothing but a black screen. I've restarted the phone, cleared the cache and it still won't work. Pure trash!!",1
"I keep refusing to sync with Facebook contacts, but it eventually did it anyway. NOT HAPPY",1
Instagram is very careless...my Instagram is not even opening since last week it's only shows a black screen not even loading...worst experience ever.. Instagram be careful towards user and recover the issue as soon as possible,1
"I logged out my acc once and since then I can't open the app. It's just black screen. I tried everything; restarted my phone, uninstalled the app multiple times, cleared cache, nothing.",1
The most annoying possible interface; when you try to took at a post it jerks up and down . Can no longer view posts independently and content is automatically jerked away from your vision in either direction,1
"They blocked my access because they are thinking that I have given my credentials to an app to increase likes. I have just installed instagram after a month of hiatus and this what I have come to. I have reached out to support but the only help you get is to go to FAQs. Bring back the old instagram team please, this one is just making this app worse by the day.",1
I'm having trouble with logging in to my accounts since yesterday.....i rarely review apps but this one really let me down because i have work i can't attend to,1
"obv sucks. reinstall a lot of times already, clear the cache, and update but nothing happened?? it just shows me full black screen everytime i open the app no options of logging in back, pls fix it. it's already been weeks since this happened",1
My Instagram app is not working not open any reels and video,1
"App isn't working properly. I got notification about message requests, but when I open them it shows no request. My restricted accounts are also not showing in the message requests. Please resolve this problem.",1
Poorest app in user satisfaction Now it shows too much ad than before and i used to click on not intrested on any reel it does not effect onymore by the way it does'nt show any effect before also. I want you to solve the problem ASAP,1
"the new update is disgusting, edit: it's been 2 years now, it's embarassing how you still haven't taken care of glitchy reels, what is your team even doing??",1
"The best feature is to be political: depending on which candidate you support, your posts and comments and likes may be boosted, or your profile may be blocked. The ""independent"" fact checkers are as parcial as they could be. Sponsored ads are just as biased as the app. Support team is a joke! It's probably the worst app I have! Could only belong to Facebook group!",1
I don't like the new update features please give me back that old Instagram and that the video call is not so good it is very very bad I do not like that please change back,1
Instagram is time killer but.... Instagram get have more and more crashes a lot of cash memory and frezzing. Instagram need big update.,1

"Last account was hacked. When I tried to consult with IG to fix it via email, they just told me that due to covid-19 blah blah blah, they weren't able to take 2 second for me to verify that the account in question was actually mine. The way that you handle these kinds of situations is trash IG, do better.",1

Instagram is getting worst day by day after an update. Im not able refresh my feed even after refreshing it is not worth . Such kind of update was not expected from Instagram . Glitch issue is an worst issue . After un- install and re- installing facing same issues . I'm not satisfied with Instagram.,1
Doesn't deserve even a single star but unfortunately there's no option to give a zero star rating. Pathetic Security!!! Worst customer support or infact no customer support. Easily hackable by hackers but extremely difficult to recover the account even for a person with genuine identity.,1

I've need to log a report about being unable to log into my account. But its frustrating when the app won't allow any report to be logged. Keeps showing an error message that feedback can't be logged now.,1
It became more video centric than photos. My attention span lasts as long as looking at a photo,1
Can't even scroll through a friend's page without seeing 5 Facebook ads. 1/10 comments will get you flagged and disabled with no proper appeal.

What a joke. NEVER WORKS. Uninstalled and reinstalled and it worked for like a day but now every time I load my feed none of the images actually load. Oh but the ads sure load every time. Zuckerberg ruins everything he touches. All anyone ever posts are reposted tiktoks. Cut out the middle man and just use tiktok.,1
"Please, fix the problem when opening a certain link the screen will go black and white.",1
"Full of ads and trying to become tiktok, the app has been losing its identity more and more. If you're not on it yet, don't even bother. Go to tiktok instead.",1

Having trouble logging in. Two factor verification not sending code to phone and back up codes does not work either. I have sent selfie videos twice and still you can not verify my account. Security is good but this is just crazy. How am I ever getting back into my account? And getting no assistance from Instagram.,1
It doesn't have option of song when I try to postüòë and no notes option is available I had report this problem but get no solution,1
"Necessary evil. Never was able to create account as myself. Only app that can crash my entire phone, regularily",1
"I open the app and I can only scroll for a bit before the app closes itself. Open again and if I don't touch it it's fine, but then I start scrolling and viewing stories and it closes again. Annoying AF",1
After updating ig few days ago I can't delete a comment once I did it's not going to be deleted or edited . Also I cannot save any reels or any story which I like because the option of save above draw option is not available . I'm not happy with the new updates .üòëüòë,1
OK the reason why I give this a 2 star review is because there is a problem with Instagram I do not get why... Whenever I get followers they do not increase they only stay between 1350 and 1380...incase u will need My Instagram account it is @Junior._.rna please fix this..... Thank you,1
So many glitches üò• nd since last 1 week my I'd is not opening. When I'm open Instagram it's not opening. So team Instagram i hope you will look out that matter ‚ú®,1
"The once trendsetting social platform seems to have lost its luster, in large part due to Instagram‚Äôs insistence on pumping more content from accounts that you don‚Äôt follow into your main IG feed.

"As a content creator, I try my very best to create and upload high quality content. Not only instagram compresses the content to low quality but also don't give android users an option to enable High Quality Uploads just like it is given in iPhone app. Didn't expect this type of discrimination for android users.",1
"Whenever I tried to open this app the logo wi show for a few seconds then it will went blank, I keep on installing and uninstalling, restart my phone, cleared the cache but nothing happens ‚òπÔ∏è Please fix this. I really need to use this now ü•≤",1
Previously Instagram used to work very swiftly. Now it is getting bugged every other day.,1
Whenever we upload story or post the quality is decreased so poor that photo or video will become so blur,1
It keeps getting worse. More creepy adds referencing conversations I had in ear shot of my phone.,1
"Very bad experience with this app, shows me active when i am not active and people just hack accounts easily.. i don't know how thy do that bad experience",1
Instagram page written letters are not showing clearly and missing letters and new fonts and symbols ...and also sometimes the videos are stuck,1
There's nothing wrong with it It's just that whenever I try to scroll to my very first message in the chat it would load foreverrr And I couldn't back read,1
"I am not able to swipe reply in messages,my messenger is not to update . already i sent a report but messagenger not updated",1
"can't open app, barely today did it start doing it, as soon as you tap to open it closes. doesn't say anything. just automatically closed by itself, like if it can't open at all. can't do anything",1
1. stop updating useless features 2. stop changing the layouts 3. what is wrong with the fonts recently??? 4. bad quality videos and pictures uploaded everytime,1
Too many meme accounts posting nudity and porn. Most ads are scams. App is not great as it used to be.,1
"I can't open my Instagram. I have tried to fix it several times but it still doesn't work. I deleted everything but it didn't fix it. I hope you make it right, I won't see the Bangtan Sonyeondan's update. I'm late, Im an angry person you know. üôÑ",1
Worst app I've ever seen. Don't install this app otherwise you will regret. My account got temporarily locked from 2 weeks. My Instagram account is very important for me. There is no other option if you've lost your access number and email üò†üò† Again I'm telling you all don't install this app otherwise you will regret üò£üò£,1
It Glitches a lot I am an old user but my messages disappear and i have to refresh to get my new messages and the messages I sent and photos and vids too Please fix it,1
My Instagram app is fully updated on the Play Store but the new messaging function is dissapeared please help to or I'll quit Instagram app because I have reported this problem for hundreds of time but I think you guys don't have time for your users. And I'll remove the one star rating when you'll fix my problem. üò°üò†üò†,1
I can't add notes please fix this problem as soon as possible i've been updating and reinstalling for many times,1
"I cannot delete a notification without an error: ""failed to delete notification, please try again later,"" and I cannot reply to a comment unless I open the post, exit it, and reopen the post. This is ridiculous! I have Android",1
Very poor app not updating to its latest features even after taking so many attempts and there is no response to complaints as well,1
Suddenly my account was disabled without any prior intimation and when i try to login to same account it was not showing the user id üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò° I want my account back immediately with a proper explanation üò°üò°üò°,1
Finished all uploading but showing this error üëâüèª You Can't switch accounts While you're uploading something.,1
Earlier till I did not update Instagram I was able to create reels but as soon as I updated Instagram I am not able to create any reels nor do I see the option of reels.,1
My Instagram keeps stopping. Please fix this bug it was alright few hours before. I found new features and some re placements of buttons today maybe it's because of this update.,1
it's Ok until they ban you for no reason which seems to happen esp. if you're a small account. support unreachable. save yourself the headache and don't use,1
I am not able to upload high quality pics on my story even after switching on the option of high quality uploads in settings,1
"Instagram app is horrible. Difficult to navigate, impossible to do what you want. Access Insta via a web browser instead. Uninstalling this piece of junk.",1
App got much worse. Buffers the whole time even after eating cache and storage. Too many bugs,1
So many I report for the cross app messaging option is not available to my account.still they cannot fix my issue.and so many glitches.no respond till now.,1
"I would have given only half star if it was possible because today along with me, the draft videos of many other Insta users and the entire draft option are disappearing from the account.And I have reported this problem five times since morning, still no help from Instagram.That's why until Instagram does not solve this problem, give it all one star.",1
the whole apps shuts down by itself after I scroll through a few reels. my phone says its a bug and to update the app after its been fixed by developers. happens 9 out of 10 times,1
I have facing an issue from one week my internet speed so fast but Instagram is not working it is still buffering i can't still see an single pic in my account please help me Instagram,1
Its so difficult to sign up always saying pls try again later unable to process your request. i regretted ever installing this app in the first place,1
It used to be a very good app. But from few days it is not working properly. I am not able to login my account. Whenever I open Instagram the screen goes blank and white in colour.,1
"My Instagram app in not working recently. I did even try to post a complaint but i didn't receive any reply from Instagram team. The problem with my app is whenever I open my Instagram, just a blank screen appears and I'm unable to access anything.",1
"An endless feed of advertising and garbage from accounts I do not follow. This app isn't a waste a time, it is mental slavery. There is no useful content. I don't care to have an endless feed if 99.9% of the content is unwanted content and/or paid advertising. Your loss, idiot.",1
The App is really bad not as good as it used to be posts show from like 3-4 weeks ago new posts don't always show and thinking about deleting my account,1
I hate this feature of instagram when i add my story with song lyrics are not available of that song those my favourites songs have not lyrics please fix this immediately,1
With every new update your app gets filled with bugs and glitches. It's not optimized at all. It's just sucks. I don't know why the font size in app increases at night...I checked whether it's a feature or something but unfortunately it's a bug. There aren't 1 or 2....there are plenty of them. Then what's the difference between XIOAMI and Instagram. Both are filled with bugs with every update 2 or 3 bugs free,1
"It's a very entertaining and popular app though I'd prefer if there were more editing tools and features for posting pictures and videos. I felt very limited while doing that. I just updated the app and its considerably slower than before. I'm quite disappointed. I thought updates were supposed to make the apps better. It hangs all the time and the ‚Äúnew posts"" notice doesn't leave the top of the page till you click it. I seriously dislike the new updates. Take me back to the previous version pls",1
"I don't usually bother with reviews, good or bad, but this is a special case: this app was always intended as a photo/content sharing platform; there is absolutely no need whatsoever for a shopping tab. Instagram has always been my go-to for connecting with friends, but it is becoming impossible to use - just when I get used to where everything is, a new update comes out that moves things around for no reason. Just quit while you're ahead Instagram. I beg you.",1
"Absolutely hate the app. It's done nothing but ruin my mental health. If i were to rate the app itself, it's about 3 stars, not more. Hard to use, prone to breaking and bugging, servers very often crash, i could go on. This one star (ideally 0 but oh well) is the rating of my whole experience. I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy to try and get noticed on instagram. It's a painful experience. It's as if the goal of the algorithm is to ruin your mental health. The problem is there's no competition",1
"I used to love IG stories. But after the latest update, I can no longer post a long video that is usually divided to 15 secs each. The quality is also affected. Photos are also being flipped and stretched to fit the screen when it's originally vertically wide. Quality sucks. It's so annoying. Plus, it made it confusing to find what button to press just to post stories. Really not a user-friendly move to implement the latest update and it's so disappointing.",1
"Hate the new upgrade. So hard to navigate through as it is soooooo different from the previous version. Unfortunately have to use it often for work, and am already so put out by having to use it with constant algorithm changes and continually being less prioritized as a small business. Struggle street! Action banned for no good reason and no one to get in contact with. Less and less supportive of small business, so disappointing.",1
Don't you love it when you select and edit 10 photos ready to post and the program just crashes. Then it doesn't autoload your last selection. Half an hour gone. Select and edit again. It's been doing this for the past couple of years. Here's an idea: maybe work on this. Word lets you recover documents you've worked on if it crashes. How hard is it to implement this?,1
"I love instagram I really do, but, it has been playing up, I can't seem to back read my messages at all it just keeps loading. I get message notifications and when I go to click on them and return to the app I don't see them so I have to keep closing the app to repoen it again and its very annoying because once I've done that I end up with so many messages that I can't read them, ive updated it and still doesn't seem to work, it was working fine until I updated it , please fix this issue",1
"The latest update is dire. They've clearly fully transitioned from displaying quality content in a way that allows the user to appreciate it, to a text overlayed mess. To make it worse, it doesn't seem to remember the preference to mute videos so every time I open it it plays some awful music from many of the terrible ads spattered through the feed like so much smeared excrement. I've been looking for an excuse to ditch this app that's now a shadow of its former self, this is the push to do it.",1
"The app has gotten more and more bugs recently.. At first it suddenly didn't detect my gallery, i had to redownload it, it had all permissions. Then i managed to get it to recognize my gallery again, only for it to completely mix things up, and change the thumbnails of recent pictures and videos, with random old ones i have on my phone, causing me to have no clue what i was gonna send. Please, it's such a simple feature. Fix these type of bugs.",1
"This is coming from a content creator!! So even after trying all the tricks and tips online, the app isn't allowing me to post a long handsfree video. Any video be it in normal or handsfree, if it's more than one 15 second clip, fails to upload and doesn't save either. I've tried reporting it repeatedly, hopefully this gets your attention! Also I had to roll back to an older update since the new update is horrible and has screwed up a lot of stuff, including no audio on going live!",1
It's really annoying and frustrating to see that everybody else that you follow has the music option for their basic personal accounts period but when you have a business account and it doesn't seem to work for you EVER even after installing reselling logging in and out multiple times. This is extremely annoying especially for somebody who's just trying to run a small business and keep up with all these Trends you keep putting out. Fix it.,1
"So many features are missing for so many people and even after reporting the issue, instagram just doesn't respond with a proper solution. It won't allow me to repost the stories I ha e been tagged into, it just shows that I've been mentioned. I don't get the ""Add this to your story"" button itself and it's been more than 6 months since this feature has been released. I am not able to manipulate the photos in my story meaning I can only post the full frame or the full photo. Pathetic service",1
"I have two instagram accounts. One is working perfectly fine but the second one is where the problem is. I could not open links from the messages. I checked my network connection, tried switching off and on my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled it but nothing worked. It would show the same thing couldn't refresh feed"" Please fix this problem. Thank you.",1
"IMPORTANT!! THEY WONT LET YOU POST A REVIEW IF JOIN THEIR BETA PROGRAM FIRST. So I just bought this new phone and looks like instagram is not compatible with the phone. It's just cutting the edges of whatever I see, when I open the app. Also I can't upload anything on my story, the screen just goes blank and never goes to normal. Condition of the app is worsening day by day. Seems like it can't cope up with people's requirement. At this point they might just downgrade to a previous versions.",1
"Since the update I basically can't update my stories at all, whenever I try to put a story up it says 'Uploading...' for ages before coming up with an error. Tried several times, nothing changes. EDIT: I tried to uninstall and install the app again, and of course. This made it worse. Now I can't log on at all, which seems like a common problem after the recent update.",1
"New UI is not user friendly at all, it's clunky and it doesn't let you scroll through the posts any more so revert back to the original. Also you can't stop auto playing the video or sound. Even you turn off the sound, it comes back up again in a couple of minutes. To make it even worse when you download the old version it goes back to Original view for a couple of minutes and then reverts to that glitchy dirty new interface. Design fail. 0/5",1
"It sucks now. First of all is the interface, it is really crappy now, too many features now. You could find everything before without a million tabs. Second is when you're at the explore page and it pops (or snaps as an other review said) the post at the top of the screen, really annoying since I want the picture/video in the middle of the screen. Can't scroll as you want anymore. And third is the auto-scroll in explore when watching anything at all for ""too long"" it moves on to the next post.",1
"I hate it thanks. The update has made it far worse and overly commercialised and not at all relevant to what it was intended to be. If you're going to include all of the shopping nonsense, please just have it as an option as an addendum to the main functions, don't push it over them so it becomes completely warped. Now the buttons or anything you want are completely in wrong or unintuitive places and it's far less accessible.",1
"The latest update is the WORST ONE EVER CONCEIVED. The feed looks like a giant wall of reels, it's all patched up together, you don't know when a post ends and the other one begins basically. It's too many videos moving up and down, the second one starting when the previous one is still rolling. Too many things happening altogether. Plus, I don't find it user friendly like at all (some stuff is harder to find now, while it was way easier before). Please go back to the previous layout.",1
"A lot of annoying bugs. The back arrow clickable area is really small, and I need to try too hard to press it. Also, sometimes it works incorrectly and returns to the top post. New messages are awful. I do not understand how modern massager has not to edit option. Telegram already has implemented all that is needed - just steal it. Anyway, just usual facebook style.",1
"The new update where you are force-feeding reels to its users is probably the worst update ever brought forth. The ""upload"" button is the most important feature in your app. You need content, and that is what runs you. And now you guys have put it on the top right of the screen, which is hard to access on a big device, and also far from your field of view. You guys have broken what was a fixed software! Terrible update - worst yet! I don't want freaking reels in my phone, it's a waste of time!",1
"It's the flappybird of social media. An app which allows you to send photos and videos and nothing else. You can't choose who can see them, message on desktop, or download anything. Now thanks to that people only share bad quality screenshots of stuff. And even then it eats your data by the gigabyte. Further ""features"" include: you can't see anything more that a day old, see images you've sent in a chat (even once), or create two accounts w/ same ip because you get an ambiguous error message.",1
"It is way too easy to accidentally delete conversations with no way to lock or restore them. If you accidentally press too long and tap, entire conversations disappear without so much as an ""are you sure."" Make it so they can be restored, and make it more difficult to delete them. I lost two years of conversation in under three seconds because of a shoddy interface.",1
"Update is terrible. Smooth scrolling now disjointed. I like seeing the text and the picture/video but now I have to open up the text. Videos play with volume (I don't always want volume on) and they seem to keep playing until you scroll far enough for the next video to start playing, so you keep hearing the audio even if you have moved onto other posts that are just pictures. Trying to work out if I can get the old version back. If not I think my Instagram use will significantly reduce",1
"Not only has the app been glitching out like CRAZY, but there is also the added issues of the new fonts not showing up for me. I was logged into two accounts. And initially I got the new fonts on one of them. To try and get it in both, I uninstalled and reinstalled it but to NO AVAIL. now I've lost the new font on both my accounts. This is ridiculous. Since I joined this platform roughly 6-7 years ago its only changed for the worse. Please fix this.",1
"Every time i try to get back on the platform, a new update is imminent. But it's never for the better. I'm a creator and i like to post when i use social media, but the current update does not make posting very accessible. On top of that, and the layout now looking worse, they have removed or otherwise made it difficult to access the feature that let you make and edit posts for later. A feature i enjoyed and used a lot. Feedback and report system is inaccessible and hard to navigate too",1
"Until recently instagram was awesome. It worked perfectly, and was one of my most used apps on my phone. Now, it loads super slow (20 mega bits per second internet connection, it's only instagram that has this issue, it's not my network). Sometimes it doesn't load at all, pictures don't display or are extremely pixelated. Updating/restarting doesn't fix it. I've read online that it ""might"" be caused by a anti botting feature, but if it is, it's restricting a LOT of real people. Please fix this.",1
"I like using the app, mainly just to talk to my friends. However, how can I do that if every single notification I get does not come through?? I've tried resetting the app, redownloading, turning notifs on and off multiple times, literally EVERYTHING. But it won't work. I've had this problem for nearly a year, please fix it. Edit: its been down for 3 hours today. Just wow.",1
"Instagram is changing the algorithm once again, you have to do more video focused content for maximum reach. So I want to make reels. The problem is that every time I add my second clip to the reel, Instagram closes. So how am I supposed to make a reel if it doesn't allow me to. It's really frikken annoying. Especially since so much of my business depends on doing well on Instagram. Please fix the reel bugs!!",1
"When I'm filming more than one video in a row, only the first one works. It has been happening for over 2 months... Because of that I just stopped posting stories, only one was uploaded the content was always interrupted and the other parts not saved, meaning to record again. If I don't want to record the same thing multiple times I need to interrupt before the 15s myself. And today, all the stories from my friends stopped showing, turned into a big area empty...",1
"The app is tepeatedly crashing even before i try to open it! I can't get on the app, even after deleting and reinstalling. I don't know if anyone else is suffuring from this issue, but it's really annoying as i used Instagram as my main form of communication. Please fix this ASAP. I have sent feedback before and reported the crashes, but nothing seems to happening or being done. I'm really annoyed with this problem and I'm looking forward to when the apps updated so i can use it again. Thanks",1
"Never had an issue with instagram until the new update that changes the UI. All the buttons have been shuffled around and the focus seems to be on ""reels"", which is just a tiktok rip off. An option is needed to revert back to the old layout. The ease of use is gone and no longer can I hold my phone and browse using the same hand. It should also not default to stories when trying to make a new post. That saying ""if its not broken"" really applies here. Quit forcing these unfriendly UI's on us!",1
"I selected the Dark option, but it seems that there's a problem, when I'm whatching a Reel or a video itself, the dark mode turns into white from nowhere. And it's annoying. I hope you be able to fix it up. It's starting to break my balls, seriusly. I have to restart the app over and over again. And also stop showing me content that I'm not interested in. Thanks a lot.",1
"Honestly I love the app but for the last few months it has been performing horribly. It crashes non stop (up to two times in the span of 20 minutes); I have it updated automatically and yet some of the new features just randomly disappear (like the music sticker, which I used for about two weeks when it first launched before it vanished); not to mention the countless times that I got the ""error"" symbol in my story saying ""unable to upload. Please delete"" for no apparent reason.",1
"Hello! I dislike it very much that within the new update the two main functions of Instagram for me (post publication button and the user interaction updates) were moved from my bottom navigation bar to the homepage only. I am a content creator and I need these two to be easily accessible. I hope you might re-consider the UI structure. I understand that the current structure might be good for the average user, but not for the creator. Thank you!",1
"Sharing w/you my experience w/ the new IG update (May 12): 1. Bottom Gradient overlay on photo - I can no longer see the natural color of the photos since you placed this overlay. I understand this is needed for the text to be readable but it affects how I look at photos. 2. Hard to read long captions because of the fixed height scroll - There are times I wanted to screenshot posts with captions but I have to do multiple screenshots because I can‚Äôt capture captions as a whole 3. The new carousel makes me think that the post is a Story and not a post on the feed anymore. I also thought that it has an auto transition to the next post. 4. Overall, the new IG post UI is a visual clutter to me. There's so much going on in one glance, I do not know where to focus my attention anymore. I know you are still in the testing phase. Please hear our concerns. Thank you!",1
"I absolutely hate the new update. The layout is horrible and too commercial for a social media site and it's much harder to navigate for a non-commercial user. Most importantly, the hardest part is that the pictures which gets auto adjusted by Instagram. Both on feed and stories, it adapts to whichever mode it likes (without any filter). All the time spent on lightroom gone to waste by Instagram trying to overdo it !!!",1
"The app has peaked its worst. The new button placements are annoying. Since the update, I've never touched those two buttons and have to reach to the top of my screen just to look at notifications. On some of my other accounts, I can't post at all for some reason the plus button on the home page doesn't exist and you can't seem to fullscreen when using the browse post button. Theres so many things wrong with this update and alot of added ""features"" that nobody asked for.",1
"I follow a bunch of really great photographers. Now, I'm lucky to see their posts. Buried between ads, and suggested posts, which are linked to tracking by Facebook. It's a hot mess. All I want, is to keep updated on the content i subscribe to. But, now, the amount of noise - ads, irrelavant suggested posts based on tracking, I'm lucky if i do. Instagram, really sucks now.",1
The application and its options are good. Does so much. But just by providing so much they need to work more about keeping it functional. It lags a lot. Hangs and errors are increasing. I'm unable to post a picture and it doesn't explains why so? Can't rectify or chose another option if there's an error? Not done. Reduce the functional aspects if you'll can keep up with the growing database.,1
"Yeah its one of the biggest media for sharing pictures and videos.. But it has zero customisation while posting.... Can't resize content. if u want to upload one at a time, can't trim videos to be shared to your story. So you have to trim using a third party app, drastically reduces videos and picture quality... It's really annoying, to be honest...",1
"The new update makes it difficult to read the caption since it's overlaid on the image. Sometimes the caption, when minimised, even covers part of the image so you can't see it properly. I prefer being able to scroll vs seeing only one image on the screen at a time. In regards to posting, there are many bugs especially when trying to edit multiple photos or videos in a post.",1
"I've had no issues with this app for over a year. This month, however, I have been unable to use it on wifi. It will only work reliably on mobile data. I've done all the so-called fixes - rebooted, cleared the cache, force stop, uninstall/reinstall etc. But nothing has worked long-term. I've noticed that the reels option does not appear straight away after reinstalling. This is when I can access my account. When reels appear, the app crashes. I'm on Android. Please sort this out.",1
"It was great, until they started to take away photographic features like the grid of thirds in Adjust Mode, and removed almost half of the feed filters. That was still bearable until the final straw when suddenly the app locked up while I was using it, asking me to verify that I am human. What's more absurd is that the app crashes when I'm trying to submit the selfie video they asked for. I wrote to Support, they said they cannot unlock my account. What good is an app that you cannot get into??",1
"I have been using Instagram from a long time. And trust me it's one of the most amazing app and I really like using it. But after recent updates, I am really disappointed with the functioning of this app. Whevever I update a story, the pixels automatically gets low as soon as I share that. Also, I am facing issues with the dark mode as the screen gets white and suddenly half of the screen gets disappeared. There is definitely something wrong with the app and that needs to be fixed ASAP.! Thanks",1
"Poor poor Instagram slowly going in the bin! Starting to get more and more problems ever time, and changing stuff dose not need to be changed! So at the moment i can not use the app because when i open it, just shuts straight off! Like it is crashing all the time, I uninstalled it to see if that would fix it. But it just made it worse, that's with the newest update.",1
"Stop updating the app so drastically, it kills the entire user experience. Not happy with the change of the home page where the basic sections were switched by reels and the online shop. Not happy with the way I have to use story effects. Not happy with the fact that the app tells me I have a few messages and can't find them. Can't fix something in the settings if I don't know in which section that issue is. So many bugs when trying to upload a video story, can't show my reels on feed etc.",1
"This app would be fine if it wasn't so glitchy!Making reels is the most frustrating part-- don't try to take a video within the app, it's not worth the time trying to avoid the bugs. I have to make and crop each clip separate from the app, insert them as a reel, and PRAY that Instagram doesn't crash/glitch out and lose all my progress! Never try to save a draft because no matter what, your work will be lost. It's a different glitch every time, but always the same story. Really not happy!",1
"An app repeatedly crashing can seriously spoil your mood. And if that app is Instagram, then you‚Äôd want to patch it up real soon. Fortunately, through the methods mentioned above, you can have Instagram back up and running without any crashing errors or ‚ÄúInstagram Keeps Stopping‚Äù messages in no time. There is an excellent chance that the app is just misbehaving because of a random issue that can be easily solved by either restarting the phone or reinstalling the app. Then there are more severe",1
"Have been having problems regarding Direct Messages and Feeds. It keeps lagging especially when there's a lot of notifications. My feeds turned into a black screen that I could not refresh, however my explore page is fine. New Direct Messages are showed up later than they were actually sent by the sender. At first I thought it was my connection, but other apps seemed to work just fine. I tried to log into my second account and the same problem is still there.",1
"I have been using this app for years, it is my favourite app - always worked perfectly, good for communication and keeping updated. Then, like a lot of other users, the app has suddenly crashed. It repeats the notion 'couldn't refresh feed,' however I am connected to the Internet - I am able to use other apps right now that use WIFI, I've tried everything to get the app going but nothings working. Would love to see a review of your system happening and getting this problem fixed.",1
"I have updated this app to the latest version but still it shows the version when reels were not started. The reel feature isn't there. Also, i can't seem to play any of the songs in people's stories. I have logged out and logged in so many times, even after that the issue is same. All the latest feature are not available. Kindly do something about it .",1
"For at least the last week I haven't been able to log into the instagram app on my Android smart tab; I tap on the icon on my home screen, the whole screen goes white, and then back to the home screen. I have uninstalled & reinstalled, but the problem persists even after almost daily updates. I notice other people are having the same problem. At current, I am using instagram through the browser, but it's not as good as the app was when working! Please sort.",1
"No longer lets me take pictures on the in-app camera, the only way I can add anything to my feed is by taking a photo or video on an external camera app (i.e. my phone's built-in camera app) & then uploading via my gallery. The option to take a photo or a video has completely disappeared! The strange thing is that this has only happened on my main account - it works perfectly on my secondary account. I've tried deleting & reinstalling the app. A photo app that can't take a photo is pointless! :(",1
"I don't know why but this problem just appear. FIRST OF ALL, when I watch a person's story: When Im at the middle of the story, it usually replayed to start without any touches or something else. SECOND OF ALL, when I want to take a video: Almost all the time it gets cutted in the middle, there's a fade before the cutted part, and also the video is gone. I hope u could fix this problem as properly as u can! *I dont want to get stress over and over again cause of the newest problem.",1
"Honestly there's a lot to like about Instagram (as we all know) but it seems to have gone downhill sharply over the past year. I've now lost all of my drafts at least 5 times, and the rather essential grid that used to come in very handy to compose pictures has now inexplicably been removed. Whatever you're doing to mess around with it, please stop and just focus on getting it functional again.",1
"Doesn't work properly on my device at all. I can't send videos in DM's, I can't do fullscreen, I can't post anything on my story (it shows a black screen), I can't add videos in my posts since it says that there's an error, the app sometimes freezes out of nowhere and I have to re-open it, the images are very low quality in DM's. Etc. Please fix and change these things. The web browser version is missing a lot of features the app has too, so it's not ideal to use that either.",1
"Every year it gets worse. There are countless bugs that never get fixed and the most recent one for me is that when I scroll far enough on the explore feed then I get literally only ads. I don't even have to scroll that far, only about a dozen posts. On top of that the crashes are still around, stories glitch out and show that you haven't opened them (which has been an issue for at least two years). You should fix existing things instead of copying other platforms for once.",1
"The latest update killed it for me. I cannot read the overlay text at all. Scrolling is impossible. Sound on video starts playing automatically and I can't find anywhere in the settings to make it mute by default. (Or change anything of value related to the appearance for that matter.) Looks like I'm the only one in my household unlucky to receive this version in the ""upgrade"". I'm begging you both as a user and as a web developer, to please roll it back.",1
The new update is awful. Cheapens photos that aren't full screen ratio so much you don't want to look at them. Makes no sense having the feed be in reels-style yet the reels are still separate and break up the flow of the feed? What sets instagram apart anymore?-Nothing. It doesn't do the job we want it to do. It doesn't do the job its trying to do. The only option is to uninstall Instagram. It's that impossible to enjoy now. I can't imagine how badly this will impact business profiles.,1
"I have been using Instagram for more than quite a few years. But lately since 1 month or so, I shve been facing a lot of performance and functional issues with insta. I try to post my pics or reels...at times it's not allowing me... it keeps on showing processing and then nothing happens. Also while posting my stories, if i try to add a saved video or pic, it doesn't loads up many of times. Yesterday even I posted a story, and it automatically vanished after some time. Highly disappointed!!",1
"The latest update makes it look crowded, unorganized and messy. It has become very difficult to navigate, and I never know if I'm seeing my news feed, a reel or someone's story. The captions have to be one of the worst parts of the update. I have used Instagram for several years and I used to really like it. It has lost most of its appeal for my private account and also my business account. If I'd wanted TikTok, I would have downloaded TikTok. I'm seriously considering deleting Instagram.",1
"When a video is playing and you scroll (even a tiny bit), the video freezes with the audio still playing. You need to go to the next post and go back to reset it. Videos in full screen are also stretched to the aspect ratio of the phone. It is impossible to view the full 16:9 video. Edit at 03/09/21: The app now constantly freezes on the S21 ultra. It gets worse and worse...",1
"Latest update awful. More than 50% of the time I can't make a post with multiple images. It picks 1 out of the 5 images and repeats it 3 times instead. Also occasionally corrupts the image and the saved to phone images. Don't even try to upload 2 videos in 1 post - it ain't gonna happen after 6 attempts. Sort it out Instagram!!!!! (Don't even get me started on the new layout, meaning you cant read the accompanying caption.)",1
"This new Instagram update is so annoying! Whenever I watch a reel to a certain limit, it suggests I tapped to continue watching, only for the video to start all over again. To add insult to injury, the function to seek reels by 10 seconds ahead or behind is no longer available. It's so frustrating that I no longer even take time to watch anymore. There's also a new option to react to stories, but whenever I do, it just remains stagnant so I either exit the story or restart the app. Fix ASAP!!!!!",1
"Constantly failing to update - regular white screen with 'could not refresh' message, also when trying to save an image it takes ages to provide a choice of where to save the image. This is not a data/speed issue with my WiFi & mobile data as all other apps work fine (also no issues when viewing via laptop). This has been happening on and off for at least 4 months and has been noticeable since switching from IOS to Android.",1
"The app is good, but it's been glitching a lot. I can't watch all the stories because the videos freeze after a few seconds and I can only listen to the audio. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling a few times, but it didn't work. Same thing happens to reels, only difference is that if I scroll down and back up the video resumes alongside it's audio. I also keep receiving notifications from dms I've already seen and answered, but I almost never receive notifications from the ones I haven't seen.",1
"This app is awful now layout is terrible, false notifications that can't be cleared. Activity page sometimes loads sometimes doesn't. I always get the impression Instagram don't care about user option. We are changing it and that's that. Then they chase the bugs for ages. Finally get it fixed and change it again. Also Fold 2 optimization is AWFUL!!!!!!!!",1
"Been having major issues with the app for several weeks, if not months. Editing photos in the app before posting always ends in some sort of glitch. I don't dare use the native editor anymore, which is a shame cause I used to like it. Even small edits, like cropping, is impossible without encountering issues. And I can't seem to post more than one photo at a time without one of the photos getting duplicated on top of one of the other ones. It's infuriating.",1
"I wish they'd stop messing about with the app, changing sh√ót all the time, creating bugs and glitches in the process... I haven't been able to post stories in 8 days, just nothing. As soon as I press submit they just dissapear into thin air. This started out of the blue, overnight, and I've tried everything from different internet connections, data/cache clearing, reinstaling, log off/on, nothing... Yesterday the Reels option was gone, now it's back... fix the bugs and stop messing with it!",1
"The latest update make scrolling through the feed an aweful experience. The continuous scroll is removed, the backgrounding of images makes them look worse and is distracting, the captions cover parts of an image and there is no way to just see a picture for what it is. Plus to read now the caption comes up in front of a pic, so if it light, good luck reading the text! Really bad update to something that was working so well for so long before.",1
"Instagram before the little visual overhaul was good. No bugs or anything. Now, there are so many bugs and issues, and now I have to reinstall the app because whenever I open it, it crashes. For example, it lags just scrolling through reels sometimes. When I chat, my bubbles become grey often. and sometimes when I enter the app from another app on home, it has the suggested posts header at the top, blocking some of the stories pfps. And it's not a phone issue. I have the s22+. Very annoying.",1
"The app hasn't been working for several days at all. It's just a white screen that says ""unable to load"". I've tried everything, logging out and in again, deleting cache, uninstalling and reinstalling, sending feedback, asking for help... No answer and no change. So disappointed. Not to mention all the annoying pop-ups about Covid and censorship of various content related to various topics. If you haven't had it until now, DON'T GET IT.",1
"New update is terrible. Very difficult to read text over the images, as well as commenting. Impossibe to see the posts and captions at the same time. The scrolling is so clunky, it forces you to look at every post, instead of scrolling past ones you don't want to see. Photos don't look good with the strange gradient in the background. Everything looks like forced sponsored content with how it looks. Please change it back, it is not user friendly at all, it makes me want to close the app instead",1
"This app is poorly supervised and maintained, despite its huge popularity. For the past two months I've been unable to post messages, show appreciation, or follow/follow back other members. ""Reporting a problem"" does nothing of the kind - there certainly hasn't been any resolution of my problems, and there doesn't seem to be any way of contacting whoever/whatever is charged with running the app. It or they are completely inadequate to the task.",1
"I absolutely love Instagram and think it has dome great qualities. However, I am constantly having issues with reels, my sound goes out of sync, font distorts or moves, the quality is blurry/pixilated, and now when I edit a reel it will not save. Also, for some reason I'm unaware of, all my reel drafts have been deleted and I can't see a way to retrieve them! Insta, get it sorted, it's not acceptable.",1
"The latest update is awful. The text is hard to read and if it is long enough, it covers the picture. The gradient is distracting, the posts clipping to the screen ruins the scrolling experience. Don't try to fix what's not broken and bring back the old layout! On the plus side, I am using Instagram less which means I am not on my phone a lot. So, yay, I guess?",1
"Highly dislike the updated UI for the news feed! The worst part is having the sounds play automatically, and I have no idea how to completely turn it off for all posts. My phone doesn't allow me to view a single post on my screen but when I scroll to see the rest of a single post, it automatically scrolls to the next post. Please revert back to the old interface, or at least give users the option to do so if they wish. This makes me want to stop using Instagram entirely!",1
"So many things wrong with this app. I get it's a big platform but seriously fb, do your servers run on Windows XP? Posting videos on your story, even when recording with the app camera gets stuck in ""Posting"" sometimes it goes through after hours but most of the times it doesn't. Comments would fail to load and video quality dramatically decreases to the point of seeing pixel corruption. At one point the 2nd blue arrow when posting a video didn't even work. Seriously looking for a new media app",1
"The latest update has made instagram completely unenjoyable, it looks awful and it is so much harder to interact with things. For some reason all the videos now will auto play audio, no matter how many times you turn it off, the next one will pop up and still have permission to play audio. The way that they have hidden captions is awful and makes it really difficult to read a caption and look at the post. You can do one or the other but not both. Fingers crossed this update isn't permanent ü§û",1
"This is ridiculous. All of a sudden I'm not able to use the audio on reel. When I am creating reels I choose the audio and then post it....up till preview i can hear the audio. But right after posting the reel, there is no audio. This is becoming super annoying. I need to know why is it happening. I searched on the internet and tried different solutions too, but nothing works.",1
"most recent update is the worst one that has ever been rolled out. the full screen feed is terrible, and does not work for anything other than the reels tab. scrolling is inconvenient and annoying as you can't stop in between posts, it is terrible for artists and photographers as the captions are over top of the photo, and the overall feel and usability of the home feed has drastically decreased. every time I open the app and begin to scroll I almost instantly close it.",1
"Totally garbage. I know Meta is a large company and the have really talented developers but their app is full of bugs. Sometimes I reinstall the app, then I can't react to any message. It opens reels in weird way, sometimes I can't even see the search button or reels button in the bottom. Videos don't repeat automatically in the feed, once finished I can't like it by double tap and there are lots of other bugs. üò§ At last, we all know they don't care about users, only money.",1
"Stop rolling out new features and start fixing what's already there! The Story is completely broken for me right now. The camera roll automatically pops up and I can't select anything. If I manage to add a picture, I can't add text or stickers. The options go blank after clicking on the respective buttons... Thinking that Instagram is such a big long-standing platform and seeing how malfunctioning it has been lately makes me worried for the future of the platform.",1
"What a mess of an app. It wasn't good to begin with but now we're steadily making out way to rock bottom. Multiple stupid crashes and bugs, missing features (the latest victim is the mysterious reels that are not appearing to multiple people including me), trying to post anything is a war of attrition, every 3rd post is actually an ad (forget trying to watch any video as well, you get another ad) etc. Either fix your app or commit to this mess.",1
"Shocking updates. Forever getting blank screens of saved items, saying there's nothing in the saved folder (when there definitely is). Click on my homepage and it takes me to my ('empty') saved folder? Click on the heart icon to view recent engagement and I'm faced with a blank screen. Constant problems since the update... Sort it out guys, this platform is becoming frustrating to use!",1
"The past few weeks (maybe longer), the app has been freezing whenever I open it. It is very frustrating. It only shows the the first post, and I cannot scroll. Closing and opening does not work. Force stopping the app works sometimes, but it may simply be a coincidence. I am on android (Samsung S8)",1
"The new update is absolutely shocking. Clearly they care more about money than user experience. The most used features of the app (post a photo, view likes) have been moved out of the way to the top corner to be replaced by a shopping button and a reels button; never used reels on Instagram and for me that's not what it's for. Instagram is losing its appeal to someone who uses it for posting art, if this continues I will be uninstalling.",1
Watching videos in explorer the sound from previous video gets stuck and it will change to the next video before the current one finishes. Try to swipe back up and it keeps going to next video automatically. Need to update the screen ratios. Stories get cut off the edges. Apparently this has been a known issue for about a year on different phones. It's pretty basic. Get on it insta,1
"After the latest update, the app keeps crashing and I can't open it! Like other people said, too many ads and suggested videos when I have already declined seeing it again. It would also be time to figure out how to upload a picture without it cutting off parts of it. For example, if you picked landscape, your pictures are all stuck in landscape and zoomed in",1
"The update has made the app much less user friendly. For some reason to add a photo and check the likes has moved to the top of screen out of reach even though they are used the most. What a shame. Also, the saved drafts function doesn't work at all, sometimes saved drafts are shown and sometimes they aren't. I've tried to upload multiple pictures at the same time and some videos to the story, the app hasn't uploaded anything and it's impossible to figure out why and you can't contact anyone.",1
"Used to be good. Now crashes when scrolling. Restart and it crashes again. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, but I'm now waiting for a text with a code in it. Twenty minutes so far. Rather fourth rate now but not surprised as it comes from the failbook stable. UPDATE: Still no response from ""developers"". Still not working. Just glad I haven't had to pay for this selling platform (aren't there enough of these already??)",1
"Love the app, just fix these bugs (please!): 1-Dark Mode glitch; whenever I leave the app and go back in, without closing the app completely, it makes everything light mode and also makes some icons not visible. I then have to close the app and re-open it again. 2-Reels Glitch; sometimes I will be scrolling through reels and all the reels would stop at a certain amount of seconds in without completing the full video. I have to close and re-open the app again. *p.s* all my friends have these too!",1
Update: This is the 2nd time I've had to uninstall everything to upload to Reels. Why so many problems? How can I use the feature if it don't work? Update: Instagram lacks good UX and UI. Just the wrong press of a button deletes everything I've been working on for the past 10 minutes. The buttons or slides are too touch sensitive or hard to use. OR the buttons don't work + you can't get back out to finish the photo. I was also not impressed how the app resized and squished my text on Reels. :/,1
"This is too much. Every time Instagram made a UI change I let it go cause I'd probably get used to it soon enough. This is not the case with the new update. Now, with regular, non-video posts taking up all of the screen, the app is unusable (not just painfully ugly). I can't scroll to see the description of a post, I can't even click the like, send, or save buttons because it snaps to the closest post if it detects I'm between two of them. The UI was fine, leave it alone.",1
"I've been using Instagram since 2015. Back then it worked like a charm and everything was fantastic. But eversince you changed and tried being like Tik Tok, it has been breaking the application. Refreshment issues each and every minute, the app keeps on freezing and I'm unable to do anything and forced to shut off the app and reopen it. Problems with the typing. All in all, your application is a huge mess right now. Fix it please",1
"I have not been able to load videos on story or posts for over 3 weeks. It freezes & does not allow me to switch to my 2nd account. I tried turning on / off phone but in the end, I had to un-install then re-install IG. I did it several times to see if it would correct the matter but it is STILL happening on both accounts. Extremely inconvenient & annoying. PLEASE ADVISE OR FIX ISSUE.",1
"The app is so buggy. The Reels tools are so broken! The preview looks completely fine but once it's uploaded, the text doesn't follow the timing you set, or gets scaled up for some reason, the gifs don't load properly... Just to name a few issues. Restarting the app and redoing the reel doesn't fix the problems either. Thought it'd be convenient to use the built-in video tools, but that turned out to be a huge mistake that wasted so much of my time.",1
"I hate the new interface. Instagram is killing one hand accessibility. It was easier to reach to options by touching the 3 dot button, but now you have to wait for that dreaded slider and change your grasp if you want to use any option. Moreover I absolutely hate your reel feature and that you have moved the discover button. No matter how much you push it on me, I am not using it. It is just a matter of time that I will switch over to Twitter completely. At least they have a better interface.",1
"Instagram surely is a great app, but here's something you guys should check-up on, firstly, The viewers of the highlighted or archived stories should be brought back, because thats something we use as a memory. secondly, the quality of pictures we send to eachother wether in DM or stories is greatly ruined, kindly let us share pictures with same quality as it has. Thirdly, the instagram has many crashes and bugs kindly improve the reliability of it, making it smoother to use. Thanks",1
"Lately there are a lot of buggs. I can't see if something is a reel or if it's just a post with text, and then when I click it it starts playing but with no sound, so I have to click it again, which makes it full screen while I prefer watching it in my timeline. Posting takes a really long time to load, and the draft I saved was gone. I used to love this app, but the bugs are making me not wanting to use this app",1
"Since yesterday my explore pages suddenly refreshed and all of my curated posts which I actually want to see, turned into random scenic photography posts. Apparently it is a bug on their end that has been around for a few years they just haven't fixed... On top of that, I feel like I haven't been able to see any of the posts from the people I follow/it only shows half.",1
"Use to be my go to app but everytime they update, they ruin something new. Tapping on a video should not take you to the reel videos, I just want to watch that one video and move on. And, it's annoying as hell that feature on the discover page that scrolls to the next post once a video has finished. I'll be reading a text post and an ad just below it will play, finish, and then scroll down. Which also, everything is an ad now. They just want to be a mix of a shopping app and tiktok.",1
It was running fine until just recently. I don't know if there was an app update but all of a sudden it's now glitchy. Live videos and Insta stories make the app crash. My feed is constantly freezing while I'm scrolling. My screen goes black as soon as I tap on a notification. And I cannot visit profiles as their feed doesnt load at all.,1
"After all the bugs and the crashes I've had on this app, it's finally decided to kick the bucket. Now it won't open no matter how many times I delete and reinstall it, I've restarted my phone multiple times and searched the Internet for ways to fix it, and it stoll refuses to open. Now whenever I click on it I'm welcomed to a black screen with no way to get past it. Thank you instagram, loving it",1
"It's seem like not compatible with HUAWEI NOVA 3 phone. It doesn't works well when I use Stories function to record a video, and after I posted the recorded video in Stories, the video will have no sound at the behind part of the video. In other words, the sound of that video is partially missing. Quite disappointed as this has happened many times when i recorded the important moments, but the sound of the video is gone.",1
"Every time I view a post from a DM, the keyboard automatically opens when I return to the chat and which is incredibly annoying. If I want to type a messages I'll open it myself. I really hope this is just a bug that will be fixed and not an intentional feature because it's so damn irritating. And now the share to story feature has been removed as well. Great.",1
"This is my favorite social media by far.. But for the past week i haven't been able to open the app, whenever i try to it just goes black and nothing happens.. just gets stuck. I tried to clearing the cache and data. Uninstall and reinstall. Turning my phone off and on. I did all of these and more in different orders as well but no use.. it still didn't work. I'm really sick and tired of it. The version i download from the galaxy store ( from Facebook ) works but it lacks so many features..",1
"Terrible and exhausting. The outage was one week ago but seems like the after effects of it are still going strong. The max I can use the app, without it crashing again, is a meagre 5 minutes. I have to keep uninstalling and installing in a vicious never ending loop! What on Earth is happening??? Absolutely horrible. Has Instagram suffered a permanent damage? No posts on my, feed are loading!!! No explanation whatsoever too! -_-",1
"Please fix this it's very frustrating!!! I can't see pictures, reels and stories on Instagram! My internet connection is good and stable that's why I'm confused why is it like that. I already uninstall and reinstall the app, yes it fixes the bug or glitch but once i close the app, this problem will appear once again, I can see the options but I cannot see the pictures of it. It's all black boxes. I do hope you can fix this glitch or bug or whatever it is. It's bad.",1
The app has degraded in terms of user experience. There's too much control over what the user wants and what is shown. Stories and reels are frustrating and keeps looping forcing you to keep scrolling. Touch some grass people. You won't find it here. Social media will never be the same. It's worst than ever. Thanks to Instagram and other apps with same trends.,1
"I really don't like the latest update! If there is a chance I can revert to the previous version, I would. Why is there suddenly a colored background for each post? It's waste of time when I can't view the photo and the caption at the same time. The photo gets a bit darker when i want to read the captions which is such a nuisance. Also, it seems that i can't translate the captions from different languages any more. ""Clicking"" analytics versus user experience is a road you dont want to go to.",1
"Posted a video for the first time in my life, black screen with only audio. Tried again with a filter to force some processing, same result. In addition, editing the caption puts the keyboard over the text field without an ability to scroll to it, so you can't see what you type. I'm an Android dev myself and I'm stumped that one of the largest companies in the world would release something this buggy. Uninstall it is.",1
"With new update app crashed and doesn't even open.....after no. Of repeated attempts...results are same.....not able to use it...black screen shows, nothing else.üëéüëéüëé",1
"Random crashes keep occurring. It won't let me post stories anymore. Having this problem for a year now where random things stop working and the whole app crashes. It often crashes when opening stories, posting stories, sending messages, commenting on posts, and a variety of other reasons. When one of these problems stops, a new one starts. Still waiting for a solution.",1
"App got more and more user-hostile over time... Deleting it so I don't try to use it any more. Textual content and photos seem to be an afterthought now. If I scroll I don't want it to auto-jump to the next video. If I'm playing a video I want to be able to mute or unmute it. Panning and zooming photos would be nice too, that seems like a pretty low bar. Most importantly, I want to be able to *read the text* that accompanies or overlays videos and photos.",1
It auto deleted my account for no reason with no way to recover. It keeps crashing everytime I try recovery,1
Swipe reply and message react option are not working. This are ver irritating.Please solve this isssu as soon as Possible,1
"There is an issue occured when I try to share story from the other who has tagged me. I cannot find share-story-button. Please help check again if this is a removed feature or bug. This should not happen when the product is released. Environment : last product version Mobile and os : pixel 4, android 13 Account id : yuwmumu",1
My Instagram is not working I have checked with all the possibilities but it's not going on what should I do now very disappointed with this.,1
Becoming worst my insta is not opening correctly from past one week but in the older version it is opening some glitch in it,1
I am facing lots of problem and glitches even payment option also not working for ads and also not showing upi options for payment it's to bad üòû,1
"no longer fun to use because when im viewing stories, literally between EACH USER there is an ad or an obnoxious sponsored thing . also when i am scrolling through reels the same thing happens between 2 to 5 scrolls, there is always an ad or a sponsored thing . im glad these people are getting sponsored and shared, good for them, but its way too much for me to have a good experience",1
"TERRIBLE costumer service, I've reached out 3 times in various ways and i havent gotten a response. Its been more than a week. I have a problem with my account and i cant get it fixed without instagrams help, but they just keep ignoring me.",1
"Instagram is the worst. So I'm just minding my own business when all of the sudden I try to like a real and it won't work. Instead the redirect me to an image saying that ""we limit how often you can do certain things on Instagram, like liking, to protect our community"" the real I was attempting to like was a small business account.",1
This app is overall very good but the feature to swipe left to reply on any reel is not working on my Device after this update I also tried reinstalling the app but still the same please fix it and almost every song is unavailable for me whats wrong with this app,1
"According to Instagram I gave someone my pass code to someone, tho I have not. Then it's requiring me to change password. Then I put in password and it's the wrong code. Then I tried to do forget password and go to my email, but it kicks me off and shows According to community guidelines. Then freezes. Please have something done about this.",1
"Incessant pop up boxes wanting me to post across social media, automatically edit pictures I post so they're awful and washed out Now I know why I've not been on it for ages",1
all my posts highlights and followers disappeared suddenly and my account does come up when I search on somebody else's phone it's just gone.,1
HELLO!!! FIX THIS PROBLEM!!! My Instagram feed is not showing or refreshing stories or feed it's just a blank page but my other account isnt! This keeps happening ! Same blank screen with no feed or stories!!,1
I can't reply and react like others do. Instagram lite is better. I reported this problem several times still no use. For my account it still shows the Instagram direct symbol but for others it's the messenger symbol. Its features are great and mine is not so good. So I don't like it.,1
"Many glitches happen. My ID keeps on going out for community guidelines, I don't know why. It unable to send any messages",1
Yall better fix this many accounts are being hacked and this makes people not wanna use it no more the help center dosent work for the problem im having on instagam,1
"It really stinks how I can have almost 5,000 followers but my reels will only get 100 views. I used to LOVE Instagram. I play by their rules. They want me to do more reels than pictures, I do reels....still, no more views. Instagram is hurting my business. I know I'm not alone in this. I see and hear this same complaint again and again. Please listen to your consumers Instagram and let our posts be seen.",1
Theres a bug it started last week when i went onto the app and it showed nothing but a black screen ive deleted and reinstalled it multiple times ive restarted my phone multiple times and it just isnt working they needto fix it.,1
I find it very strange that IG has updated the app well over 16x in the past 2 months. They are collecting data and and keeping tabs on your location.,1
"I feel like i don't ever enjoy to use instagram anymore.It is because after instagram update a new features about (reels) in this July 2022.i don't really like reels at the first place.And now, i can't post a video like usually i've been posting before cause instagram have removed that.It is hard to get a viewer when i post any video with using reels.This change are the worse for people like me who doesn't get a lot of followers in instagram or for a new in instagram.Very poor and frustrating!",1
It is not working properly and it is not showing photos properly to put on story because of this I can see my photos properly and post is on story it is not working properly improve your app,1
"Suddenly stopped working, asking to confirm that's it was me, more bugs and glitches very bad performance üò≠üò≠üíûüò≠",1
"Ig is really annoying my old account got hacked and despite everything I tried to do and every complaint the old account remains. and now whenever I get a nodfaction of a text it dissapers after 5 minutes I tried fixing it but to no avail , ig really sucks. Now the app won't give me a nodfaction at all if I get a dm I reinstalled turned on everything still no nodfaction I hate this app so much",1
Few days back my account got suspended for no reason and later restored now there is techinal error in accessing my account. Instagram is getting worse due to these glitches.,1
Can't upload anything now. Shuts down when you try to post just a regular pic. Forget trying to post a reel. üò°ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,1
Insta is too good I have good experience on Instagram too good too high too amazing too fantastic too nice Its a good way of communication it's too good for us and a better way of communication for our community I wish you well all Instagram users God blessing to all of you with billion of prayers it's a way of knowledge all new updates about all over the whole world it's rating is too high it's one of the most popular apps for all people 80 to 90% people of the world are using this app & enjoy,1
"My account has been banned without doing any suspicious activity. This is very bad, i have lost my all connection. ü§¨",1
Instagram keeps crashing...its been 24 hours insta is not working at all ....posts are not loaded..i can't see anything...please fix my insta,1
I have a problem in my Instagram chats I can't reply by sliding an message or pinch ü§ètype and I also can't react any emoji on any message like other's only heart react is available for react I have reported many times but no one here's üòè,1
A My instagram is not working what does it mean why it is not working I request you to fix it as soon as possible.,1
"Hate this app. I made a profile to get people who want to bring the game ""Gex"" back. But this site glitches like crazy and I never get any help. They even suspended my account when I was adding people and never told me why. This site is more of a headache then anything... I have to prove Im not a robot almost every other day üòë",1
"It was good until it just stopped working. Now when I try to use the app it just shows the logo and a blank screen. I've done just about all I can to try and fix it, nothing works and it's been this way for a couple weeks. At this point I think they just don't care to fix their app.",1
"I cannot tap ""reply"" on direct messages in instagram and I see on youtube that millions have this problem. Why does instagram not fix this? Awful",1
"It's broken. The app keeps quiting by itself. Especially when I'm on home page or trying to post. Quit after 2 seconds. Tried to re-install, doesn't work",1
My account got suspended for no blimey reason what for? As I don't use it much but it's always on my phone. And now it told me it got suspended today without a valid reason. Not a happy camper at all with this. If you do that at least send an email and explain why.,1
Constantly crashing when trying to upload multiple pictures to one post.,1
Bad!!! For some reason ddis not let me to go to my profile part for some reason everytime it crashed it. I tried downloading it and now it goes blank. Does not open at all! Pleaae fix this!,1
Instagram is creating some error whenever I tried to open my Instagram black screen appears I can't use my Instagram please help me to solve the problem it was creating too much disturbance to me please help me as soon as possible... still my problem haven't solve please do something as soon as possible I'm still waiting for your response üôÇ,1
"i cannot share or reshare story in main account but other accound works fine. Tried every possible solution which includes restart, log in and out, uninstall and reinstall and nothing works. i sent report many times but no response from ig team...PLEASE RESOLVE!!! edit - i doubt the devs even read our issues. issue still not solved edit: logged me out for no damn reason and i cant get back in",1
I suddenly can't get into my account. I have emailed Instagram and NOTHING! I created a new one and all I see are suggested posts and no way to stop it! Considering deleting everything. This is a disappointment as there are too many sexual accounts that pop up and if ypu block one 5 more come up!,1
I loved using this app to share music on my story but then all of the songs on my highlights stopped working and I couldn't even use the songs because they were completely removed from the song kiosk. :/,1
Always disable my account without any reason üò°üò°. Even I followed all community guidelines on support system availabile here .my account got disable without any reason my all important documents are in the account only.üò°üò°üò° What can I do now.,1
A Reel which is restored is not available in the Profile and whereas when the app is reinstalled then the same reels are visible for creators but not visible for others. Also after sometime those reels get disappeared from Profile for creator as well.,1
Used this app for over ten years now. Got rid of facebook around 6yrs ago. Now I think its time to get rid of insta. I can no longer upload more than one picture and tbh its been having upload problems for a while. Im done with social media ‚úåüèº,1
"Constantly breaks, currently crashes whenever i open the app and dms. also unpersonalizable you can watch a single video that vaugely mentions a subject then absolutely everything in your feed will become that",1
"My account often logout from the app suddenly. Instagram also forbids me to tag other people's accounts in comments on a post, if I keep do that there will be a warning and my comment will be deleted immediately. Very strange, even though I didn't write anything, just tagged people's accounts. I created a new account because my old account was deleted by Instagram suddenly and I couldn't recover it because the number I used was no longer active, expired. I HATE YOU",1
The app is slow and unresponsive.,1
The UI is extremely annoying. I don't enjoy using the app like before. Stop trying to fit every feature into the app. It's overwhelming.,1
I am entering perfect Gmail adress and password but it is showing that this user name did not exist. Please solve the issue,1
"As I can't rate this at all and if I was it would be a negative 100. As I know it's insta, but it's instant b*******. Would not could not allow myself to introduce for invite this app",1
Instagram sucks from last two days i am unable to operate it i cant watch reels cant watch stories my network is in a good contidion but instagram has some glitches.,1
Hey this is renish i request you plz remove this remix in reels becoz the one who hard works and creates the video the remix one is just copying and pasting it and he is getting more likes so i request remove this remix version or else donot public these remix video...,1
I've used this app for some time and now it's like I can open it up but then it stops and goes back to my home screen on my phone not on Instagram it just keeps stopping I've uninstalled and installed and still hasn't worked I've had to use it through Google not the app.,1
It's an ok app but glitchy and the feed under the search bar doesn't ever actually refresh. You swipe from the top and the same posts are still there even after hours of not using the app. This app could be A LOT better,1
It was a great app but now it is having a glitch I tried logging in but it is showing username doesn't belong to anyone plz improvw the glitch,1
"Reels won't display on my page and the feed won't refresh. Terrible experience. For 2 weeks, the audio wouldn't work on my reels either.",1
"Its not loading, feed not refreshing, stories i cant see, its loading n loading. Search or notification also not loading. Message also not loading.",1
"Since the latest update the entire interface has been reordered to show you as much media as directly as possible and keep you addicted to the app. Even the button to create a new post has been hidden away up top, only visible on the home screen, since it doesn't matter anymore if you create anything new as long as you keep consuming ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I guess that's it for Instagram. Thanks Mark.",1
"The music feature is having problems. I can never find the songs I want to share. Basically it's working on singular words rather than the whole title, which doesn't help at all when the song title has a word like ""a"" it comes up with every song that has ""a"" in it rather than search the full title. I can't share any of the songs I used to share because of this. I don't know when this happened but I really hope it gets fixed soon as I used to share songs daily. Cheers, Galaxy S8.",1
"After the new terms, a window keeps popping up about the terms having been approved (""You're all set!"") making the app unusable. Everytime I try too look at messages or try to exit the app, the message pops up again. I have tried clearing the data, and when that only worked for a bit, I tried re-installing it but nothing seems to fix it for more than a few minutes. I would like it if this issue could be fixed soon.",1
"Instagram used to be an app where photography was the main focus. It became a business and as such, for business, being able to keep track of the analytics provided in-app was a good tool for us who care about organic growth. Now, it is TRYING to compete with Tik-Tok as it implemented reels, at the same time it removed the chance to organically grow. Really bad. Really, really bad.",1
"THE NEW UPDATE IS AWFUL! It's so clumsy and confusing. Also the icons up so high at the top of the screen are impossible to reach erganomically holding my phone in one hand. I want to be able to see my likes easily and instantly, as well as make a new post and story. Instead they're all in different windows and places. You've complicated something that was simple and nice to use.",1
"Can't post any picture in my profile since last night. Yester night it's stopping repeatedly and from today morning (after update the app) no pictures loading! So horrible!! Once I had really loved it, recently feeling terrible",1
"Instagram used to work great for me, but as time goes on, more issues pop up and I'vee waited years to see if an update fixes them, and none have. About half the people in group chats I'm in can't see any images/videos sent, nothing seems to fix this, and it isn't an issue with apple vs android. On top of this, sometimes the screen goes blank when I try to view a post or account, and I have to uninstall and reinstall the app to fix it (temporarily). I hope this review does smth but I doubt it.",1
"It's been 3 months since the Instagram Reels feature was released in my country. I've updated the app multiple times after that, still I don't have any access to making Reels. It does not appear in the create story window, where it appears for most users along side 'Live' and 'Story'. It only appears when I go to the '+' sign but there it doesn't work at all. Clicking on record button does absolutely nothing. It doesn't load up any short videos from the gallery. Please fix this ASAP.",1
"Bad. Bad experience. 1stly it takes up so much space. There's no option to be able to clear the cache, which is silly. 2. The app crashes alot. U try shooting a reel and the screen goes blank. 3. It feels like instagram is just desperate for the users to try the new features. Storage is the main problem, and its silly no one else is talking about it.",1
"This latest update is totally ridiculous. The key features of Instagram - posting, and reading notifications - which have been in the same easily accessible place for years has been moved to the top right hand corner, where they sometimes literally can't get accessed??? And been replaced by shopping. Who shops on Instagram of all places????? These changes to the UI are just totally unnecessary and impractical, the app is just becoming harder and harder to traverse.",1
"Been unable to open the app now for 5 days! Tried un/reinstalling to no avail; just a white screen for a couple of seconds then it kicks out to main screen again. I'm tempted to just give up! Here we go again! App has done an update and yet again won't open. On the plus side, I've got used to not having it, so it's no great loss. 8/9/19. It's gone again! Just says 'Unfortunately Instagram has stopped' when I try to open it. Might just delete my account. I think I'm done with it.",1
"This app has become my go-to app for awhile now, I actually spend more time on it than Facebook. But lately, Instagram has dropped down my list hugely - for only one huge issue I am having. The issue - every time I post a photo to my page, the caption/description & hashtags completely disappear. Only the picture remains which is highly frustrating. If I edit the picture and try add in my caption again - it says 'your edits cannot be saved, try again later'. I have been 'trying again' for 2 days and no change whatsoever. Instagram - please fix this problem!!!!!!! I need this to work!! (note: I have uninstalled the app, and reinstalled it - does not help. It's been updated, closed properly - nothing is working). üò´üò§üò≠üò† Thank you.",1
"My music sticker feature has been missing for several months now. I've tried everything to get it from uninstalling and reinstalling the app, logging out and back in, clearing the cache of the app, still nothing. I've seen I'm not the only one with this problem, many more are missing this feature aswell and yet the problem still hasn't been fixed. Also my app hasn't been fully updated. I don't have the newest look of the profiles.",1
We ith new update i can't even post my video. I have been trying for past 5 days. It says can't post now every time.,1
"It's happened a few times where I attempt to upload a story and it just gets stuck uploading. Internet connection is fine, other apps work fine, but Instagram is frozen trying to upload a story that it won't allow me to cancel sending. Which means I can't upload anything else. This has happened on two different phones now, and the only fix is to uninstall and reinstall the app, so it's clearly an Instagram issue. But why fix it? Not like it's limiting functionality...",1
"All of a sudden a few months ago it started glitching like crazy. I can barely do anything anymore. Can't like anything, save anything, can't follow and every few minutes an error message pops up and won't go away, making me close the app. Now it won't let me post anymore, if it does it's without a caption. I've reinstalled it too many times, sometimes twice a day for it to work for 2 minutes. Only reason I'm keeping it now is for a couple DMs. Pissed off.",1
"I've had the app for years, and it worked well for me, but just recently, I was not able to post something on my account nor stories, even after updating it, clearing my cache, uninstall and reinstall the app. I have a good Wi-Fi, I can't see the issue, so I left the account for some days, and when I came back, I could post stuff again on my feed but not in stories, I could barely post few words, no stickers, nothing, it just keeps saying ""Error"" and that's it! Any help would be appreciated!",1
"Why can't I change my profile picture? I've already reported it months ago, nothing has changed. Still, nothing happens. Repeatedly saying that there was an error occured and to check my internet connection and has only one option but to ""DISMISS"". Please fix this. Updating the app doesn't help and even clearing data of it and logging in again is still not working. I can't even repost the stories that my friends tagged me. Hoping for the fast action to this concern. Thank you",1
"This app was on a steady decline with its changes in algorithm, persistent bugs and glitches, or inconsistancies in features, but it's probably hit an all time low with the recent inability to refresh the feed. I've seen SO MANY reports and reviews that mention that people are experiencing this issue, and yet you've done nothing to fix a feature that's integral to the usage of your app. UPDATE: You've now removed my stories and highlights. Thanks for making the situation worse.",1
"Hello, I was using the beta and had this problem where I wouldn't be able to slide on the posts at all that contain multiple pictures, it becomes impossible to do unless sliding ultra fast, and even then its like 30% responsive. I'm using a one plus 6 and its brand new. this is happening in both your beta and this version, please fix it. I can send you a recording of my screen in case you can't reproduce it .",1
"After the new update, not only is the interface terribly cluttered by unnecessary features, but the ones I actually want to use the app for ‚Äî like, I don't know, posting a picture? ‚Äî are in an inconvenient place and way less organised than they used to be. The explore scrolling has a horrible snap which makes it difficult to read captions. One of the biggest caveats to me though is that I seem to be unable to send posts to friends - they're not in the list and I can't search for them. Yikes.",1
"I'm having an issue which I think is linked to my account, I did report the problem many times but never had a response. When I log in, my feed loads and suddently the app crashes after 1-2 seconds. I say it's linked to my account because I tried on different devices (Android 9.0, 8.1, 8.0) and the issue continues to occur. When logging in with another account, it works well. I think something in my feed makes the app crash, so I can't do anything atm. Please support, reach out!",1
"I've had a post stuck for a month and a story stuck for two weeks. It doesn't allow you to log out whilst it's trying to post, so troubleshooting tells me to uninstall and reinstall. Now it won't reinstall. Facebook, why did you come along and ruin something that was once great? Joined three weeks after it started. Soooo much has changed. Not half as good. Not even close.",1
"Please sort your app out! It keeps ""posting"" to the home screen after I've uploaded, but is nowhere to be seen on my profile. I was advised to uninstall and reinstall the app, which corrects the situation only temporarily and then it happens again. I have seriously lost count of how many times I've had to do this now. I'd really like to post my photos!",1
"Half the filters disappeared recently (everything to the right of Nashville) along with the option to manage filters. I've reported it multiple times and no one bothers to fix it or even respond. Edit: It's somehow worse than it was when I wrote that. The filters are still gone but now it won't load any of my photos so I can't even post anything. This issue happened intermittently before but now it's stuck. Fix your damn app, instagram.",1
"I am very disappointed by this version of the app. It turned out to be a major time-waster. The app puts a lot of emphasis on the explore feature that shows an endless series of posts made by strangers, a little bit a la tik tok. The search function displays way too many erotik contents that shouldn't appear so easily in a supposedly family-friendly app. I would totally enjoy using a ""lite"" version that lets me do just what it used to: share pictures with family and friends.",1
"Very disappointed. Loved it when it first came out. Could see all my friend's posts as soon as they posted them - now it's completely random, I miss a lot, and there's more ads than posts. For the last few months I get the ""Instagram has stopped"" warning CONSTANTLY. I have restarted and re-installed so many times it's ridiculous - no support and no resolution. It is now uninstalled again - maybe for good this time.",1
"Like the app content for the most part, but Instagram is constantly auto-updating. Even though my auto-update option is switched off and no other app behaves this way. Firstly, I haven't given permission for the download. And secondly, it is incredibly irritating to have to constantly move the app from phone memory to SD card. Please fix this!!!",1
"The last update is very useless and whenever I scroll, it doesn't happen, there is only one post on scrolling. And full screen does not work in this update. Whenever you click to stop the audio, the audio does not stop but the video is played on full screen. So, looks like everyone else here is having similar issues. It's tiring. Why do you have to keep changing things and make them worse? We can barely use the app now. And we've all I'm sure just wanted to enjoy the content. But you can't view",1
I'm so disappointed with instagram since I updated it the last time... Each n every video saved in draft has disappeared... The moments n memories captured can't be done again...very much disappointed with it...üò£üëé,1
Being consistent user still reachability is getting low everyday. Not getting any proper guidance. As an entrepreneur not clear about any features or any update. Not get any response from Instagram. Please help to understand instagram features clearly. Also help to understand the app easily.,1
"This time I am not happy with the app.. I asked the support group of Instagram regarding some problems.. But they hadn't yet answered me i.e, not given response and not given no solutions..",1
"Worst app üòë when I downloaded it just now as I have changed my phone so a blank screen I'd coming I have waited for 30 minutes that now I will get a screen from which I can login to that app, but still it is not coming. Please solve this issue as soon as possible.",1
"I got banned 7 times and Instagram isn't telling me what I did, love the app hope the computer responsible for this malfunctions and stops working ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"I gave Instagram one star is because Instagram is trying to copy tiktok which is sad. Since Instagram is all about helping creators share their story, their talents, a way to express ourselves but unfortunately Instagram forgotten where they have started that was from the people who made Instagram blow up. So Instagram stop changing the algorithm to save over like because not everyone will save the post to promote their creators and what the point about likes anymore.",1
"I don't know how much time it will take to give me the transition effects in the reels, Instagram Sucks",1
My acount was hacked and the support team is non-existent. There is now way to contact them.,1
Unable to create reel on saved audio... frustrating even after trying multiple times,1
"I can't even reply in dms. The app is updated, I've done EVERYTHING, it still won't work.",1
Nowadays Instagram is crashing so bad even in gcs we can't remove anyone or do anything and always crashing and showing Instagram is not responding and the amount of crashes are just hard to deal with kindly please fix this issue.,1
I love to use this app I was saved any videos on Instagram without any app but from the last week I can't saved any videos the saveüò©button disappeared,1
"With the Latest update, you made the icons bigger and added more space to them. The result is that all the content we can see together is now smaller. In the era of borderless screens, I don't find it useful that we got bigger icons and less space for content. It should be an option to choose in the settings for people who cannot see that good. It should be not the standard setting,just after an update. Very uncomfortable with it.",1
"This few month my company account has been hacked multiple times. I have reported to Instagram but yesterday someone still hacked even already updated the security. And sincr yesterday I tried open my own account, but the screen is blank until now. Please fix it and update your security system. Thank you",1
What wrong with the app yaarr.. Not working at all not even a bit.,1
"unable let me react message and reply message that send from my friends, seems guilty and the conversation is same color,unable to see my friends story",1
"this app is by far the worst on my phone. Since Meta took over everything started to bug. Lots of ads and NFT bots that avoid getting banned by covering themselves in a short video. As a content creator, posting something is tremendously hard. Lots of bugs in reels which Meta is trying to push in my face. They need to fix this app.",1
"Since the latest update, 9/27/22 I believe, I cannot access my full gallery. It shows some pictures but not all. Seems to be no rhyme nor reason as to which gallery photos I can view. Certainly not recent pictures!",1
Unable to login or reset password. Password reset email or verification code was never received. Is the server down?,1

Soooooooooo many glitches. After 1 or 2 minutes it automatically stop working. I uinstalled and redownload but its not working. And there is also problem in story . Whenever I want to post a story it take more than 30 minutes to upload so please solve this problem.otherwive i will delete it,1
"I can't deal with this anymore. When I delete and re-install Instagram, videos, reels, and stories will play and load perfectly fine. But once I close the app and re-open it, reels won't play, videos won't play. I'm left with a frozen frame and a refresh button. I have seen a lot of people experience this problem over the past couple of days. Cant post anything either! I really want to watch reels smoothly. I've tried a lot of ways (clear cache and data) no luck. FIX IT!!!",1
"I go through instagram reels a lot. So many times it get's stuck and I have to switch tabs to either 'home page' or 'my profile page' for the reels to start working again. Why the hell is this an issue??? I have missed so many videos just because the screen gets stuck on reels and when I come back, the old video is gone and now it's refreshed. Are you serious? Why is no one fixing this issue? Instagram is such a well known app. How can you ignore issues like this? This is frustrating.",1
"Once they removed the chronological order of posts (quite a while ago, actually, but they do not seem to be going to fix it), the application became totally useless. Before, I used it for keeping in touch with friends, which is now entirely impossible with their smartass sorting. Recent posts don't show up, instead I see all the same 'popular' photos from three weeks ago. There is no way to be sure you've seen recent posts from someone.",1
"This latest update isn't very well thought out. You can no longer post 16x9 videos, you're forced to a square aspect ratio that cuts off half of your video image. Not sure how that was decided. And now we have an extra step to post something to our story. Use to be one click. How is that a good thing? Does Instagram want to slow down the use of stories? And the likes button disappears when you click it, as well as the post and message buttons.",1
"The app has not been working on my phone since months, i randomly get logged out of my account and cant log back in. I tried uninstalling and then reinstalling the app but that wont work either. Its a humble request to fix this problem",1
"On iphone, you can use sounds from videos recorded. Also, you aren't allowed to upload gifs to stories. Haven't tried to post gifs on post but it's probably the same result üëéüèæüëéüèæ. Also very glitchy",1
"I hate your IA, it isn't really intelegent because it only give us limitation of friend list that we can see. I added my following list because i want to an update from their product etc, but this IA makes me only see such story of friends everyday and i feel bored with it. And if i see following list, this IG doesnt show many of friends sign of story , only if we choose their profile and direct to theirs , we can see the story. Bad IA. I hate your ads and your suggestion.",1
"Because it keeps on lagging and for my account the update will be so late, I wanted to view my friend's story but this app swiped it so fast and I tried to hold it but it was not in time so I couldn't view it. INSTAGRAM PLEASE UPDATE MY ACCOUNT TO.",1

Anything i do leads back to the ""your comment has been deleted"" page and it wont let me apeal or ask for help.

"No chronological timeline. Every other entry on your feed is an ad OR a recommendation for content I'm not interested in. An absolute struggle to simply view the content/accounts that you actually follow. Suggested reels are full of stolen content from other platforms & accounts. Instagram thinks that it knows what you want to see better than you do. The app squashes true creativity to cater to paid ads, big businesses, & content farms. The user unfriendly experience you can expect from Meta.",1
"Can't upload any videos. Yes, it's updated.",1
In instagram im not getting emojis if i click on video and then if i drag any messages i doest drag,1

I even did the video selfie verification for 7 times but it doesn't recognise me as the owner. Anyone had this problem? Know what to do for it?",1
Another cool app that Facebook/Meta bought and ruined. Full of all kinds of glitches that never get fixed.,1
Forces you to add a phone number and then refuses to send you a code to verify with. Immediately became useless,1
I don't like this app anymore üëéüëé üëé scrolling has become more irritating . I will be happy if I don't get to see any reels . I just wish if it introduces one feature where we can opt for 'do not show any reels ',1

"I have to reinstall the app everytime I want to change my profile or highlight's cover picture. I have had this issue over a year now ane reported it many times, it's clear that you don't care about bugs reported, since I know I'm not the only one - there have been articles over this issue and you still can't fix it. The reason why Instagram is dying it's because it's so slow, if you can't take care of a simple bug, shut down, your time has passed. Also stop compromising pictures' quality",1
The app isn't working well. The screen gets Black and it shuts down the app immediately. It gets impossible to have a good experience.,1

"The new notes update doesn't work on only one of my accounts for some reason, also the app has become generally annoying bc it often has bugs that they don't fix no matter how many times you report them",1
Very high data consumption Look into this issue as soon as possible,1
"after every update it's not working properly,, Totally rubbish & useless app.",1
Respected Sir. In this app i am unable to use the feature to reply on a specific msg on chat...its not working. Pls help. It will b highly appreciated.,1
"Glitches glitches Make a sofisticated app rather than hiring someone, paying them over 10000 dollors just to make your app settings complicated for users.",1
"I'm sick and tired of Instagram political correctness. It's so-called ""Dating site"" is nothing more than an online Cathouse...a Brothel. I had one woman actually charging $300 dollars just to chat. The rest try to hit me up for money in one form or another. Ridiculous!!",1
What the hell man i log out from my old account and try to log in my new device but i forgot my password when i tap to forgot password the code is not coming to my mobile number or either my email. Iam trying this for last 1 week and still iam not getting the code. I hope you'll fix this soon.,1

A big defect in community guidelines and disabling accounts. Some people indirectly using violent languages still aren't facing any problems and i try to explain such people in their way and instagram disabled my account. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,1
"I cant get to my gallery to upload! It's only showing me the folder that I already uploaded which is ridiculous. If I use the other option, I cannot upload multiple pictures. What is the point of a photo sharing app if you can't actually share photos?",1
"Absolutely full of child exploitation under the reels, there is no way to stop it. I've reported multiple accounts and none get banned. It makes me genuinely sick. Awful company.",1
Picture and video cropping is very annoying. Uploading and selecting pictures and videos are too difficult. Make the uploaded more easy to use like Facebook.,1
Overall a good app for entertainment. Nowadays I am facing problems regarding messages. Even after updating and reinstalling the app many times I am not able to reply to messages and can't even react to them. Please Instagram look into this matter,1
"This is the 3rd time in the past 4 months where I've tried to open the app and it just crashes, this is my primary mode of communication and I don't want to move apps but I might have to if this keeps happening.",1
"To be honest, this was a good social platform but i really hate this app because it has many issues i don't know where to start, this app has suspended my account i don't know why. I know I've been using this app for so long but never had any problems but now this app is a worst platform for me. I even filled my username and email but it still doesn't working.",1
I have updated my app so many times but still I haven't received my notes feature yet and I have reported a complaint too but still I haven't received my notes feature üôè,1
My Instagram isn't working.All i can see is a white screen . Instagram lite works but it's interface is nothing like the main application.Many other people are facing the same problem. Please do something immediately. thankyou,1
Everything was amazing until Instagram flagged me as a bot and blocked me from liking posts. This is stupid when your whole social media revolves around likes and interactions.,1
So many bugs on this app lately. I suddenly don't have the reels option and i can't reply to individual messages. Maybe it's time to get off Instagram ü´°,1
"Very slow loading other post . Not because the line problem ,other apps working fine. Only insta apps having this issue and keep popping up ""reels can be post at the moment"" n i unable to remove it.",1
It's been more than 2 months since the app started crashing and I've tried every possible way to fix the problem but it doesn't work at all. The lite version is also not good as it does not have a lot of features of the original app. Hope this gets solved. I wouldve given a 0 rating but play Store does not let you,1
Msges are coming very slowly and not working properly this update,1
"My posts are not been able to open whether my old stories, archives, posts even stories highlights in which I have put background music are not able to play, I think instgram doesn't care about their users facing worst experience.",1

"I downloaded this app but all I get is a blank site screen. I tried deleting and re-downloading the app, rebooting my phone, clearing cache. I tried everything. It seems to me this app is only working on iPhone but not androids because my wife is using it just fine and she has an iPhone.",1
"Too many things not working properly with thr latest update, all mentioned in previous reviews. Edit: Too many advertisements! My feed now also STARTS with an ad! I loved IG for a long time but now it just irritates me whenever I open the app!",1
"Its Instagram, what can I say, its quality has slowly been downgrading trying to be like every other social media platform, the worst part at this point is the almost constant bugs, glitches, and overall failures of this godforsaken app",1
"I uninstalled the app couple days ago, now I installed it again but it's not opening only a blank screen shows up, I've tried to uninstall and install a lot of times but everytime i open the app blank screen shows up!",1
My recent post feed is not updated from last 4 day's....but its visible in following section...this glitch is not appropriate pls work on it...@instagram,1
"Edit my review. This app is the worst. I want to see pics of my friends or thing I follow, instead I get the worst worst worst reel suggestions related with disease, body modification, awful topics that are visually unpleasant. In tik tok I get so much better recommendations, fun, interesting, SFW videos.",1
As soon as I start this app I am always getting the Black screen. Very disappointed...... It has been more than one week and I am still facing the same issue. Really disappointed.......,1
"like previous comments ive seen, i have a samsung 20 and my insta wont even open, and when it does everythings completely reset with all my dms and its always like i just signed in. even after deleting and reinstalling it and trying to fix it in a number of ways it just wont work. today is only the first day thay its happened and im worried that itll end up being like everyone else experience and still not able to use it after weeks. which really sucks because its my main way to text.",1
I can't sign into my account. It keeps telling me there's a problem. I also can't ask for help logging in or resetting my password.,1

Am facing issue while watching reels.. I can only see 4 reels after am getting error vlike no internet connection.. how come it is possible,1
I uploaded videos just a few days ago like I have always done on my app. And now today it won't allow me to select any of my new saved stuff I have in my gallery for some reason. I have checked everything to make sure something wasn't touched that allows me to upload them but nothing. So its the app. When will this be fixed?,1
I'm trying to send reels to my friends but after some time it says failed to send ...this is too much off irritation ... Some time this happen with the text message also which we do... Can this be fixed sooner as possible,1
Easily gets controlled by spammers. I asked for assistance yet there is no response.,1
I am not able to see my latest following ID's... Instagram is full of bugs now a days...it is not like before... Fix this issues asap,1

It won't let me do anything with my account after I updated it. It keeps leading me to an unsupported link. Please fix this.,1
The recent update similar to messenger is terrible. Don't feel like using instagram anymore. It's highly disappointing,1
I do like being on there Instagram but i hate digital bugs it should have something like dark mode but they should have bug report and problem like hacker alert also there should be something called bug problem like saying cant get into our accounts and if someone is being mean we can press something called person report where we can report someone off Instagram forever also hate digital bugs reels everything should work,1
App suddenly just stopped working. It wont open for more than a few seconds and then it shuts down. This just recently started happening.,1
Nowadays Instagram is going very bad I can't add audio while posting reel and I can't crop the audio . Sometime the caption doesnot appear after posting .this is really annoying plz try to solve .,1
STOP changing the video features from IGTV to Reels and even the Cover image dimensions for videos are changed again and again! And why remove the Video SERIES playlist feature?? This is so frustrating!,1
"If I wanted tiktok I'd download it. I really think instagram has lost sight of what made them great. Instead of trying to be tiktok, maybe the developers need to look at grass roots and what made them big to begin with. Such a shame to see it become what it is üëé",1

There should be a way to block specific emails or phone numbers! This option is just for show! And btw this platform is deleting so many videos for no reason. Instagram is not the same anymore.",1
I've enjoyed Instagram till I got hacked among it impossible to retrieve my account. Very upsetting as I had some beautiful people in my network.

"Am unable load any story , reel messages . Even I have Wi-Fi good internet connection and have good mobile data",1
"Black screen issue : App has black screen when I tried to add account or login for first time , I tried every possible method as clearing cache , storage , unistalling and reinstalling app , restart the phone ....etc I have the issue on both pixel and samsung phone",1
"How can I disable the notes feature on Instagram, it's annoying for me, and I'm not satisfied with this update.",1
I have tried to delete my payment method but I couldn't find it in my setting and Instagram have been debit money from my bank account ever 6 days.,1
"Not working on my 3 android phones after the update. Tried rebooting each of my phone a couple times, and now I was forced to reset one of my phone and nothing happens. Instagram still won't load. Update sucks",1
I'm having problem in replying and reacting to messages. Idk why even after updating this app isn't working properly.,1
Hell of bugs. App is getting crashed every now and them. Cant even use properly.,1
"Permanently locked me out of my account. Says it's sending me code via email, but I have received zero emails. Phone number is an old one I haven't used in several years, never thought to update it because this is the only time in the 5 or so years I've had Instagram that it's asked to send a code to my phone. Now my account is locked with no possible way of getting back in. Not wasting my time creating a new one and starting over from zero followers... Not happy at all about this.",1
"I have losted my hope from Instagram!!! I don't know what's wrong with it's algorhythms... At first i used to get good views on my reels !! But now they're not giving ne proper views ,even though i post content daily... I post story daily, i always use trendy songs and best hash tags , i do various kinds of contents!!!",1
Such a wrost app my all data base get cleared automatically when I restart my phone and I can't connect with server having good network. Always fail to connect with server. Please try to solve it. And one more thing it buffle too much having 5g network.,1
if you have 2 accounts or more you might have problems like i do to switch in between accounts. Used to work fine. Now it is a nightmare. Update. Reels drafts diasapear and absolute no help.,1
üòíStill not fixed The quality of stories decline once you highlight them. Dark theme keeps glitching Videos,1
"Totally broken most of the time. Can't believe the team is larger than 3 people. PMs need to focus on functionality of main app features like posting, boosting posts that have locations, and reducing post failures.",1
"Too many ads and suggestions - mostly unrelated. It takes 3-4 swipes up to refresh the feed. New posts are shown in the old posts section. Buggy. What a heck is going on, Instagram? Oh come on! I even have the duplicated posts in the feed. 0 of 5!!!",1
"Been down for 2 days. Every time you open it it closes out. Or if you open and try to report problem, or look at video or basically anything the app closes out again. The app is currently worthless",1
Instagram just keeps asking me to enter a verification code that I never recieve. Extremely annoying.,1
It has been a good one.. But since 3 days it's been a disaster.. It juz shows certain songs to be unavailable in myegion when the person next to me can hear it.,1
I haven't received the update since months about the notes please fix it as soon as possible because I have been waited patiently not anymore.,1
hi! I have a problem of saving reels there is no option of save when i wanted to save a reel this is so irrating for me i hope instagram would take a action on this problem but although the app was good cause of this thing i can't give this good ratings!!,1
I like Instagram but after the previous update i didn't get the note feature so am really upset,1
Instagram is frequently not responsive ND freezes while using.... really annoyed and frustrated üò°üò°,1
App only shows blank screen when opening. Tried deleting and redownloading. Deleting the gache and data in settings. Restarting phone. Restarting wifi. Nothing works at all.,1
"Positively horrible. No originality, dark mode doesn't work correctly. UI is non responsive at times. As a Former QA Manager, I would fire the ENTIRE QA team and begin anew. Boring APP.",1
"It's been a month since I've last accessed my Instagram. Because it would simply load and turn completely white after I waited for hours, I couldn't really do anything with it anymore. Please fix it, cause it seems like I'm not the only one having this kind of problem.",1
"Too many unnecessary changes of previously good features, too many bugs, not enough control of the content posted (too much gore, graphic, +18 stuff that you can stumble upon without even following questionable accounts). Still a good app and much better than Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat or whatever. Keep up the good work Instagram Squad and for the love of humanity itself stop changing good features that you implemented into annoying things.",1
"As horny as I can get, I would not like to see soft porn everytime I open an app. Due to this, I have strated to look for alternatives. -SexGod",1
This is horrible ü§¨...At 9pm my Instagram didn't work properly i don't even post my story on Instagram app....i don't know what happens but i want my problems solution,1
So many bugs.. Too slow to upload story and reels. Report so many times but there is no use,1
"I keep reporting the account whose pretending to be me, but i never get the feedback from Instagram. It's really annoying!!!",1
Wrost app.. when i dislike content..but it can't allow to dislike any content.. I'm facing this problem still 20 days..,1
i literally can't open the app. a black screen appears every time i open it and it doesn't load at all. i've tried ALL troubleshooting techniques to no avail. it's such a hassle.,1
"* In the home page - Every 4th photo is an add - way too much! * In my friends pages after pressing on a picture and then pressing ""back"" it scrolls all the way to the top - very annoying bug * In the search page ""Reels"" is taking the entire screen on the top with very annoying irrelevant videos. Sometimes simplicity is king. Growth doesn't come from mess, it comes from strong focus on value. Look what happened to FB, you're taking IG on the same route.",1
When someone sends me messages it doesn't show me any messages. hope you fix this issue soon :(,1
"I hate this app tbh it is so hard to use and the constantly changing ""rules"" of how to actually get your posts seen are insane lmao. For the love of god pls fix the annoying photo size requirements that crop all my pics badly and the compression that makes all my pics look like they were taken on a 2000 Nokia once they're posted. Also like 80% of my posts are ads or ""suggested for you"". Don't suggest things you think I might want to see, show me actual posts from people I chose to follow üòë",1
"Current version is extremely buggy, can't post new content and my feed I never Current, always a week or two behind",1
"I'm an digital content creator. I'm getting buzz of followers, but it's not showing in the followers numbers, Even after showing followers, again it's reducing the number and got stuck at the same number, this is so discouraging to new content creators like me and to many. There is an another big bug that is if a group people are reporting the account it's been deleting by Instagram. People are using Instagram loop holes to target the growing and blackmailing many people like influencers etc..",1
"Can't post videos on my story, app is broken and they won't do anything to fix it!",1
I'm unable to use my insta account even when I have a good network idk wts wrong there many new glitches so please Instagram take care of this nd please resolve it ASAP if you have balls üòè,1
"Automatically logged out of my Insta ID without my knowledge, and I am unable to Log into my ID so I request you to find faster Solution.",1
"Very buggy these days like a cheap social media app. Has lost all its dignity, new bug everyday.",1
"A day or two after my new update, my reels draft just disapperared. I tried restarting switching off and all possible ways. But still not able to get back the drafts.",1
"My instagram app isn't working for last few days. Its completely a blank whenever I open. I've tried so many things like restarting , reinstalling , clearing my data nd cache..,Its not at all working So Please fix this issue as soon as possible",1
what bullcr@p is this ?? instagram ruined.... can't even edit and upload reels...u will have to like just upload the video. any editing like attaching sound track or trimming the video just crashes the app. Nonsense app,1
App not working since two days. Unable to view stories and posts. Please fix.,1
"Giving 1 star for the millionth time 1.

"Damn bad service. Seriously, how many times a month you have to glitch? Sometimes it shows that my activity is suspended even if I did nothing against the rules, sometimes it just shows less followers. What the heck",1
Showing too many ads and too many suggestions on who to follow. Facebook really screwed this app up.,1
I created a business account and i have no options to use hindi audio for my reels. Instagram was really good before but now it sucks,1
Waste for business people we can't upload more than 15 posts perday I don't know how Instagram thinks it will workout for business vendors Mailed about the issue for Instagram But no use all time waste . They will never respond there was so many bugs .,1
"Earlier there was a save option whenever I would upload reels on my stories. After the latest update,it disappeared, it's not there anymore. This is really frustrating",1
"Can't refresh in 2days ,not working properly, worst experience and never find any help",1
with each update the app has gone more buggy and makes it hard to use.,1
"My reaction to chat doesn't work , I cannot add Music to my post , it glitches way to much , useless app",1
Amazing app.. I'm using it for a couple of year...its all awesome but I want more themes for messenger.. So pls provide nd make it more awesome app ever.. I'm satisfied with insta..,1
App was really nice but I want change theme options ki chats I updated my insta recently but I don't have changing theme options in chats,1

My message option is keep loading and loading also my old messages are not showing..,1
I am not able to see the notes of others Notes interface is not showing at all Total disappointment,1
My Instagram is de updating At first my reels bar was gone Then notes bar Reaction option Tag reply and turned into an old version can you reply me why is this happening,1
Instagram did an update and now I can not view anything. Error connect to their server.,1
"At first I couldn't switch between my accounts because the background was white, after that I uninstalled the program and reinstalled it and after that I only had a white screen. I did this many times and nothing happened",1
The new upgrade is horrible The stories don't play the videos on there and the reels The filters are bad now,1
Saved post unavailable view. When opening saved... it automatically comes out of the app,1
Critical malfunction. Will not open after update. Immediately closes after loading initial feed content.,1
Newest update hides large swathes of stories behind a button you have to continuously click I just want to see how my friends are doing and enjoy their art but meta has decided i have to fiddle with broken buttons to even do that This story gatekeeping is just the latest update to degrade the experience in every way imaginable they literally do not miss an opportunity to make this app worse,1
"Worst app with lots of upload issue. It has been more than 7 years but the Instagram upload issue is real big thing. 1. You can't see the upload percentage like YouTube 2. You can't cancel the video uploading. You can just delete it after it has been uploaded. 3.(Major Issue)Upload quality gets very low after video is uploaded. I mean why? Like YouTube users have the option to watch the video in low, medium and high quality why can't Instagram give the same option?",1
"So much restrictions as a content creator trying to get your work seen, and eventhough it's owned by Facebook, it's so hard to consolidate content to make it easier to share on Facebook & Instagram. You basically have to find ""reach"" separately in two different platforms.",1
"Not a good app .i cannot able to post my stories with Instagram music even with my internal videos .i reinstall again updated, cleared storage,cache data everything but same problem that couldn't be upload showing.",1
The views do not go in the videos and neither the solution of the problem is available from the side of Instagram.,1
Problem in login. When I try to login every time it shows error and I'm unable to login my ID from 3 days. I don't what the hell is wrong. I mailed 3 or 4 times but no action is taken. It's very frustrating.,1
Getting worse day by day. Lot of bugs and glitches. Facing buffering issue all the time.,1
This one star is for stories in which picture quality is reduced whenever i put a full quality pic in my story its quality automatically reduced please fix this,1
"I haven't been able to log into my account for 24 days at this point. I've uninstalled the app, re-installed it, restarted my phone and made sure I was running the latest version of Android. All I get is a white screen and nothing else.",1
"After having this app for years it's horrible. Just good enough for me to keep browsing, the amount of glitches happening on a daily basis is horrible. There are literally always new glitches happening.",1
"Been using Instagram for years. I just got hacked yesterday and there is NOTHING I can do about it, especially since you cannot contact any sort of Customer Service. There is NO excuse for not having a Customer Service department, especially for a company as large as Instagram. Unbelievable.",1
"Well I've been using Instagram for a while, and never had problems, but now I can't log into it with my other devices since the last updat the only thing I see when logging in is ""There was a problem logging you into Instagram. Please try again soon"".... I've been getting that message for the past 3 days",1
"I can't upload any of my recent pictures from my phone. I've force stopped IG, reset phone, checked all controls and its only giving me a choice of pictures that I've already uploaded to IG. So frustrating. What's the point of having the app if I can't upload pictures!?! üòî",1
I can't login to my accounts it always says the username is not appear and all the usernames are correct please help I really can't use all the accounts and even can't make new account,1
"Time consuming, privacy concerns, unbalanced censorship. But then again, is where I can consume pics the easiest",1
It's not working properly...it strucked... even though I thave proper network it's not working...I'm totally upset... please fix the problem,1
"Its been weeks now, the app shows a blank white screen, with no option to login. It's frustrating. I sent a message to the developer for assistance, but i have not received a response.",1
Starting it was ok but now a days I am not able to post any of my reels. When I complen about it there is no response from Instagram. What to do if possible please help me,1
"Will randomly suspend your account with no reason and no warning, I don't even post anything and have now lost saved posts, messages, and friends.",1
Instagram won't allow me to like or comment in posts and it's been going on for months..... i get a message that it's because I use apps that help boost followers when that is not true.... all I have used is the instagram's in app post boost and I did that a couple of times .... I have reported thus multiple times and haven't since any change nor have I gotten a response....,1
I have still not got the Instagram notes feature on my account. Even though my app is completely up to date.,1
I can't react to messages and after reporting the issue several times instagram still hasn't fixed it.,1
My engagement is way down due to not wanting to post lame TikTok reels. Instagram no longer cares about photographers and the algorithm hides your content even from your followers.,1
"Pleaseeeeeeee help me! My main id was temporarily locked, I tried to restore it, everything went well but at the last stage instagram sends otp but I never receive that otp on my email. Since I had only provided my email, not a phone number, please help me recover my account. That main account is still visible to the public.",1
"This app has been driving me crazy for the past 2 months. I've been unable to pos4t anything and, at times, send messages! So, I have had to delete and reinstall the app several times a week! I've tweeted them and contacted support and NO response! It's also been happening to others, I know! They need to fix this ASAP, its a big nightmare for such a popular app! Update 1st April. I'm STILL having to delete and reinstall the app at least 3 days per week! Absolutely nonsense!!",1
"Since the new update it has become more difficult and annoying to use. The captions going on top of the image makes it very hard to read, as well as the gradient effect changing people's images. They have also hidden the 'save' button instead of making it an easy single click. Hope they change it back üôÑ",1
"It has a massive chache which you can't change., it's a gig or over which is ridiculous. On an app where you don't really see the same pictures again often, you scroll through a feed of new pictures each day it doesn't make sense for the app to have such a huge cache and especially for you to not be able to adjust it. Other than that the app is medium for what you need. Also a huge issue the photos are all portrait and you are constrained to make wider shot photos work on the app.",1
I can't be invited as collaborator. Why? Even Instagram Doesn't Help Support while you wants Help from Them. I'm failed after Reporting this for Multiple Times.,1
"After many update till now I can't get my smart messaging service. I can't reply to somebody, can't react on someone's message.after all I deleted this app . If my problem will solve as soon as possible then I download this app again otherwise I never install again this app .",1
"The app no longer opens or work in my phone, whenever I open the app it shows the home view with Meta attached to it, after that yhe screen will go blank, I have updated, reinstalled it also, still no way out",1
"Why fix something that's not broken? I installed instagram to stay in touch with friends, not watch random influencers. The feed and suggestions tab is literally the same thing now. I'm loosing interest and maybe it's a good thing",1
This app doesn't censor p*rnography. Broken app. Almost all the big meme pages I follow post ads of OF girls. And all include nudity and p*rn.,1
I've been hacked since 8/21 & have been reporting it everyday since. I've contacted the support email I found in the developer contacts & have tried to recover it myself several different times. I have yet to get a response since.,1
"Ads every second story. One minute video becomes so choppy while recording that I can't see what's being recorded. Upon sending, looks like a potato did it.",1
Good luck posting literally anything without your first photo duplicating and replacing all the other photos you edited. Unable to post anything anymore. The app is unusable and broken.,1
"Very bas experience. App is crash and sone technically issue I face from some before days üò°üò°, I can't see my followers and following list and my some reels views are drop üò°üò° if instagram don't fix this problem in 2 days, I will delete and uninstall this app.",1
there is no feature that you're still able to edit and add photos on a existing instagram post,1
"Instagram keep crashing on my s22 ultra since last week November, no updates arrived since this bug reported...very dissapointed üòî",1
Worst app ever!!!!! Too much irritated and frustrated with this moron app developers... Just can't register my mobile number... Unable to open my instagram account... Fcuk u!!!!,1
Messages are not loading proper after opening the application,1
"Very bad experience with Instagram my app crashes every time i open it, i reinstall my mobile software and Instagram also",1
Tired of updates and also the bug not fixes soon. You are not rectifying our issue soon.,1
"I have been trying to upload a post for days, and every single time it says an unknown error has occurred and wont even go to the editing stage so i can save it as a draft. The app has seriously gone downhill the last year or so, with ads every two posts, and bots in every comment section. The actual functionality of the main aspect of it have just depleted completely.",1
Such a worst experience i am unable to unsend message at a particular time . One of the biggest bug just go to hell,1
"Only refresh when asked to !! Plz remove auto refresh, it is not useful, plz add instagram store option.",1
"It literally won't even open the app anymore I've tried restarting my phone a couple times, uninstalling the app at least 3 times, and even force stopping it a couple times nothing works it just won't let me enter the app",1
Recent changes to Instagram's algorithm have had devastating effects on social media & content creator businesses as of late. Instagram continues to ignore the majority of its community which is abundantly clear if you read the comments on any official Instagram profile. In the past year my Instagram experience has degraded to the point that I am no longer sure this is the platform for my art. Unfortunate.,1
Wth is wrong with this idk It keep glitching even tho my wifi is on i can't see any post or stories Instagram needs to work on this So bad this insta is working Only if i could give half star,1
I really loved it but as soon I updated it m getting lots of ads every 2 sec please solve it as soon as possible,1
"The Android IG app is a buggy, frustrating nightmare. Every time I try to share a reel, it gets turned upside down or loses audio or both when I try to save it. Given that reels are being pushed as the only way to reach people now, the least they could do is make them actually WORK. I'm making reels because they have said we have to now, and to have them then get mangled by the app every time is beyond frustrating. At this point I might at well give up and just move my efforts to Tiktok ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1
My Instagram completely stopped working and just shows a black screen now...I've had other problems too but this is just ridiculous. I tried everything to try to get it to work.,1
"Why i cant save my reels video, unless and until i have to post it to my story. Any solution for this.",1
"Dear Instagram team,..I cannot send a message on my Instagram,..please try and fix the issue...thanks",1
It was good earlier but nowadays whenever I try to upload a reel the sound on that video doesn't appears,1
So whenever i open my app it appears black screen. I try to fix this by reinstalling again and again but still it shows black screen after opening the app. This problem is not only in my device but also in other devices so please fix this problem ASAP.,1
"This app has evolved into a poor mans version of tiktok, which is the opposite of what users want. Make tye main fead exlusive for content that users follow, not to advertise other content. And place the activity tap back to its original place, the marketplace is not a tap you use often",1
"After the last update, it kept shutting down after every 2mins even now!!!! Please try to fix this issue & so many people are facing this issue after the last update. Hope this gets fixed soon!!! Thank you.",1
"Kinda works. Chat notifications don't work at all, videos sometimes don't load. Posting a picture is a bit buggy. And stories sometimes don't load.",1
They have restricted my count 4 times now despite the problem being resolved several months ago. Also no way to contact support team,1
The videos and stories keep freezing while audio is playing. Can you please fix this bug? It's really making the app unusable for me. I use a Redmi Note 9 (Android 11),1
I keep on waiting for a long time and nothing is loading. I also cant log in my accounts. This has been a while and ive been hearing about this problem with others too. Please fix this as soon as you know about this. Its happening more often.,1
My account issue have not resolving poor technical support. I have reported so many time but no response received. My account have some issue about video post or reels are not uploading and i have not done anything again the community guideline. Then why this problem occurs. Poor technical support,1
"not only did it crash on only one account, but it deleted ALL of my reels drafts because... ? why exactly? I didn't log out, I didn't update. I had at least 10 that I spent hours editing and now theyre all gone. this app only gets worse and worse",1
"Constantly glitches. Have to Uninstall and reboot constantly. Time limits on the lives. More features in the messages than on a live. I wish they'd make it better and less censored. We can screen share in a chat with up to 8,why only 4 in the live? Why no screen share in the lives?",1
My Instagram is not operating. Whenever I am opening it it's showing just a blank page nothing else. I installed it almost 10 times and again uninstalled it but it is showing the same problem. Kindly check the issue and try to fix it .,1
A very worst experience on Instagram. It suddenly & frequently closes after opening. Unable to use it. Kindly look into this.,1
Too many bugs. Video filters are poor since reels were introduced.,1
"Since last night, I cannot open the instagram app. It's just black and seems down although I can use and open my account in the browser. Already tried to uninstall and reinstall but it stays the same.",1
"Two of my accounts have bugs mainly when I post a story, the video and the music are not lining up with each other and it's been weeks since I've posted a story... I've deleted the app downloaded it again, updated the app seriously done everything to see anything change but still the same. It's getting annoying. And my stories are banned in most countries but it don't make sense since I've always posted a story that I've downloaded from tiktok. And now it has a problem!?!?",1
My Instagram just got crashed I don't the issue . Every single time i open the story archive its just got stuck there Please fix the issue as soon as possible. Thanku,1

Thank you not Now I am in 2022, you just still the same",1

Hope you would fix this as I'm not the only one one has this issue but thousands as well. I saw thousands of users complaining with the same issue with me.",1

I said no changed my password then it kicked me out and and let the hacker back in. Tried contacting Instagram and you can't email them, phone them or anything. I will now be deleting anything associated with Instagram. My Facebook is getting deleted and my WhatsApp. Meta clearly can't protect people. Should be ashamed of yorse",1
"Spending ages editing photos to find out that the images are all twisted and broken up by the time I go to post them. Like smashed glass shards. Happens every time I try to post more than a couple of images. The images also duplicate themselves, get moved around or disappear. Absolute rubbish. It's been like this for the past two months. Never happened before this for me. . Also, I am sick of having to scroll through profiles I don't follow or want to follow. So bad.",1
"When adjusting the photo size it added white borders, use to auto adjust the crop to fit but now it's broken",1
"(2019) I can't comment on anyone's story and when I'm commenting on someone's post, I can't see what I'm typing as the texbox & keyboard aren't synced - the text box stays in one place, while the keyboard blocks it. (2021) Always having issues apparently. Trying to post multiple photos in one post and when editing, it changes all photos to the same one.",1
"Went from 5 stars to one star. I try to open the app, but all I get now is a white screen. I've followed the suggested fixes online, to no avail. I'm seeing that others have posted the same problem recently, but there are no responses by Meta.",1
Updated and got an alert that the app has a bug. Can't post anything.,1
Full of bugs can't use Gif in story of Instagram messages are not showing on time totally very bad experience with this app,1
Latest update is terrible. Have issues sending messages and to open videos takes 15 secs or so. Maybe it's the size of the video not sure but pretty odd.,1
"Won't allow me to log in shows blank screen. Cleared data uninstalled, then installed still blank screen, restarted phone, tried again, still blank screen. Waited 24 hrs then 48 hrs and still nothing. Going on 2 weeks now.",1
I'm so so so sick of suggested posts and seeing stuff I'm not interested in. Also over the fact thag once I view a friend's post it's then gone from my feed when I reopen Instagram. Instagram has gone so downhill and all I want to see is great photos from my friends.,1
I cant log into my Instagram account..... It says my username is wrong....and it is not even sending me back up log in email....it‚Äôs kinda frustrating...,1
Trying to open but all I can see is a white screen. Been doing the clearing data and cache and also trying to uninstall and installing it again but still nothing change.,1
"I used to love this app. Now it's garbage and has so many bugs it's almost unusable. I'll get notifications about messages then not be able to see them, I can't access the shared photos history without the app closing and now that feature doesn't even work. Several other problems like the feed no updating or showing me posts from a week ago. On top of that the overall content has turned into pornhub for teens. Facebooks always trying to be other sites and since they bought Instagram it's trash.",1
Can you fix PLEASE fix the issue of repeating showing the same stories of same people I've seen before? Because of that I can't see other people's stories I haven't seen. If they issue doesn't get fixed. I will get off Instagram and not USE IT as often.,1
Always i am unable to delete my account. Everytime its showing the page has been removed. Please fix this,1
"Ive had this phone about a year it glitches constantly. And service or reception or signal or whatever you wanna call it, sucks. If you live in the country, you my as well forget about it. You'ed be better off sending smoke signals.",1
I can't log in using app... always login me out automatically.... App quitting or not responding on my phone,1
I'm very disappointed I've been trying to open instagram but every time it's stuck after opening application when it shows instagram logo it's stuck don't even shows log in page I've tried everything reinstalled application again again but it didn't work.. Please fix it.,1
"App is so broken, too many ads, reels don't loop well and can't event share them correctly in story",1
"i miss the old Instagram. I don't want seeing someone's picture on my feed, i just want my following friends picture to see on my feed. Also, idk why but everytime that I save my captured photo on my story, it always ended up as gif and not a jpg. really hate it. bring back the old ig.",1
the new change to selecting photos for posts is absolutely terrible. i can't resize photos before i post and the layout in general is really strange and uncomfortable.,1
Instead of adding everything new fix and make the things you already have work! Stop auto cropping and scale the whole image. You can't select bottom row in drafts either,1
I can't apply any song on post and when i search any song i did not get any...!!!!!!!! Even i can't save audios Instagram have a lot of glitches And whenever sending any msg it doesn't show the send button!!! Fix it pls üòøüòø,1
"Violating privacy, mostly ads, not a fun experience. I shut down 4 of my accounts months ago and do not regret it one bit.",1
I hate the hyper focus on reels and the decline of still photos. This sucks for visual artists and businesses that rely on still photos to market to their audiences.,1
"Guys, roll back the update. Ui is gone pathetic it loads after 20sec neither it gets store via cache. In messaging you guys have removed replying option to chat. Even individual chat media gets load a very slow. Giving seprate options of call and all is not useful, it was good previously when we has to get in specific chat only.",1
"please stop showing me ads I dont want to install Instagram. Meta / Facebook whatever, respectfully your app sucks and ads even more.",1
"I never usually comment on technical issues. But the recent update of instagram has a real issue, and that is, every time you scroll down someone's page and click a picture and tap the back button, you straight up go to the top page and that is the one of the most frustrating thing a social media can ever have! Developers please fix this issue at its earliest!",1
"All payments options for running advertisement are gone from screen like UPI,gpay,net banking, etc....after update Please help and get back them......",1
I don't even want to give it one star ! I can't even use the app for a couple or weeks. Whenever i opens the app it shows a blach screen and nothing else. I have written a repost and feedback but all in vain !,1
Im using samsung note 20 and when commenting I cant even see what Im typing. Seems the keyboard is covering the textbox.,1
"The experience for the saved collections is really awful, there's an all collection which is default, but when I create a new collection to save certain types of image or video it saves for both the new and the default all collections, so when I remove the image or video from the all collections it removes the image or video from the newly created collections, yandex has even a saved collection feature, but in yandex the photos and image you save is only for that specific folder or collection.",1
"I've enjoyed using Instagram for years, but for the past three months I have been unable to post. The app freezes and then crashes as soon as I press the button to create a new post. I've reported this to Instagram innumerable times and had nothing more than a ""your feedback is important to us!"" message. I'm writing this review in the hope that if nothing else it prompts them to fix this issue. A great app otherwise, but when big issues like this go unsolved, it's ridiculous.",1
"Very bad UX since the last useful updates! The options of sharing a post/story should be easily and fast reached, not prioritizing reels and the SHOP options over them. Also, sending posts to friends has become hard: the people you talk with the most are not on top and most of the times if I type the name of the person/group I want to send something to it doesn't even work. It should keep all the new features for sure, but thinking of them for a better UX and ideas coming from the community.",1
"The popularity of the app is inversely proportional to the quality of the app. A. Works differently for different people. I'm not able to see the reply to DMs option, whereas most, if not all, of my friends. Tried reinstalling the app several times. No response from support either. B. Video size cannot be corrected without using external apps C. Should have option to pause videos on the timeline",1
"It can be useful for things that are popular, but if something is actually important then the algorithm is against it. Another more general problem is that the developers keep making it less and less practical to use, I see a video, want to read the caption, but can't because it comes over the video and sometimes past the top of the screen and can't be scrolled to.",1
"The newest update is terrible. It crashes every time I try to post so I keep having to uninstall and reinstall. Plus, it looks rubbish, shows too many ads, forces random photos on me if I reach the end of the ""new"" photos on my feed, and won't show me past activity if there is no new activity. I could go on, if I could be bothered.",1
"Everytime I want save multiple drafts, the location changes Everytime I open my post drafts, the app crashes Half the time when I look at my story drafts, they're gone and I have to restart the app multiple times until theyre back, thats if Instagram hasn't deleted a story I've been working on I can go on. My Instagram is fully up to date, so it's nothing to do with updates",1
"I had given two stars in the past. I'm giving one now. Apart from the crashing, now it gets some great ideas by itself and hides my search bar and my chats. Instagram is basically a waste of time without my chats. So I'm very close to deleting it and sticking to viber to chat with my friends. Let's see how this goes üôÇ",1
"It is working really horrible. I always have problems with the app. It crashes too often, especially when I want to make a post or stories. Sometimes with a black theme, everything suddenly turning white, including text or text turns black on the black background. Please, fix it, it is really irritating.",1
"I would have given this 5 stars if the app still worked. I've seen that others have had the same problem as me, and it really frustrates me. I'll try to open the app, and it goes to a white screen, and then it just crashes! Ive tried re-installing it and everything, nothing has worked. I run one personal account and one art account, and it's difficult to post to them when the app refuses to work. Please get this fixed so people can easily use Instagram again.",1
"Ever since the latest update my Instagram keeps crashing and/or won't stop freezing. It's very irritating and it has been happening for over 2 weeks now. Please fix this issue as I know I'm not the only one having this problem. Also, I would love to see who has viewed my story on my highlights and not just for 24hrs. Thanks!",1
"Great app and so are the various things that it offers. But from the perspective of messages it basically became unusable. My DMs won't load, not only few messages but entire chats don't show up. I even tried reinstalling the application and it only got worse, everything just disappeared. Please fix this, the app is great and I don't wanna lose all my messages for a few bugs.",1
This app's interface is one of the worst I have ever seen. Absolutely terrible. Whenever I try to post something it's so slow cause it always tries to auto play a random video from my SD card which it fails to do and just keeps playing audio in the background. How stupid is that. It crashes often. When I try to edit text the keyboard just goes over all the text and you cant scroll it to see what you are editing. There are so many more problems which I cba to even bother writing here.,1
"At first, it just went well. But, at several days after, the dark theme just went wrong on a taskbar on the bottom of the screen which contains home, explore, (+), notifications, and profile. The background of the taskbar just suddenly appears in white color and the icons cant be seen. One time, the problem is even worse. The igstory new writing types are just disappeared and also the theme selection in the settings is also disappeared.",1
"Posted my reels atleast 20 times. Every time I post, in the preview it's alright and then when I post, the background music turns into this strange white noise.",1
"All of a sudden I have nothing. Will not refresh, no update just a blank main page....",1
"Cant hear stories if volume button doesnt work. Also cant disable vibration notifications. If someone send and image, i have to go out of the chat and open again so i can answer. Translation option isnt available in all chats.",1
"Update: When I want to mention someone on the stories by writting their usernames, the suggestions don't show up, making it hard to mention people. Videos and stories keep playing even after I press the power button and the screen is off. So bothersome, It has caused me lots of **** troubles. Annoyed!! Everybody is using it, ok. But it has a lot of annoying bugs and features that if instagram does not do anything about it, well...",1
"i think must 90 % instagram have chenge! This is a very bad Instagram structure, you need to change the tone design group. Compare your telegram with WhatsApp, see how useful and user-friendly telegram is, but Instagram is a lot of extra ph and a lot of incomplete features. When I'm going to create it, everything! For example, a small thing in multiple videos should be the clip itself, but it is not in reality, and the user should not have to do with his hand to the track!",1
"I see it's happening to others, but whenever I go to open the app it just goes black. I've tried uninstalling, deleting the data, everything. Please fix it",1
"More often than not, I'm posting a reel, the video was filmed vertically, the app shows the edit screens vertically, the preview is vertical, the cover selection is vertical, but when I post it, the reel appears rotated and stretched, so the video is distorted. Then I have to delete the reel quickly before anyone sees that horrible mess. Sometimes I post it thrice, doing all the edits and filling the description again, only for it to always end up wrong, until I just give up on. I hate it.",1
I can't even use the app. I am a content creator and I can't make money logged out looking at a black screen. Please intagram and Zucc. Get ya app working. I know yall wanna keep mining my data. So fix this. I've been using this app for 10 years only experienced two hacks to my account. Besides that smooth af until recently. So please fix this,1
"I constantly have issues with this app. First it was the beta version, so I got rid of that. It didn't fix the fact that I can't do two back-to-back series' of 4x stories with captions (the second set of 4 somehow reverts to the first, rendering it literal trash), and now I'm missing hours and hours of story updates from my regular contacts.",1
I am unable to post reel on my story since past few days...... After new update..... It shows a lot of glitches... Please improve..... And whenever I post my picture on story with song the picture gets blurr for no reason,1
"Instagram was working fine but recently it has gotten worse since the last update. It's so glitchy. When you have to write a caption in stories the color changing option disappears or the sound in others stories isn't audible and then one has to go back and start the app again. It breaks or freezes or turns black too often. And there's a weird sound while clicking/uploading pictures on stories. And, I'm sure there isn't any fault in this phone because it only happens for Instagram.",1
"Although is supposed to be a great tool, the android version sucks and has tons of bugs. It lowers image resolution and brings a lot of trouble when editing multiple pictures feed posts. It duplicates some pictures and deletes others. Sometimes it does not let you adjust the frame. It makes you waste a lot of time. I've also found bugs while creating reels. It serves little to give feedback since almost never you hear back from them.",1
"Since the last update, this app is pure trash. Slow and mostly displays a white screen instead of anything else. Also, the data saver doesn't work as advertised. Put it on and guess what? Videos still pre-load and auto play. Thanks Facebook! I'll change my rating once the app is running on Android the way it does on iOS.",1
"After the update, I've given up on creating reels as I keep accidentally sliding to live/stories when editing and then everything gets deleted, then have to restart again, wasted so much of my time doing this. Why could it have not just stayed the way it was?! Also don't post to my feed as much as I used to, due to the fact that I can't save drafts. Reviewing products and not being able to save drafts is a nightmare, feel like giving up on Instagram altogether now!! Not happy!! üò°",1
"Can't open the app. Shows the loading screen with ""Meta"" on it then goes black. Cleared cache, reinstalled, did everything, still the same. Been going for 3 days now. Please fix asap so I'd adjust the ratings as well.",1
"Poor performance app, I complained about the issue that reply option is not visible even after update. At starting I enjoyed sharing but now I am going to uninstall soon if the app doesn't work properly. It's annoying.",1
"Hi, my Account suspended. Suddenly show suspended, last i just syories cute cat. I cant appeal from help center, i already attach ID/Passport but on this step i must open my instagram. Cant, cause my acxou t suspend. Try appeal with app, but stuck on upload foto selfie, oi have info seccess upload or not, and button disable/cant click. Please can help me, give me access to appeal or verified ID or guide me. I need my account back.",1
When i try to post something it says it has a bug and to wait for a developer update. I just redownloaded it and git the newest version but still doesnt work. It was great before this.,1
"My story videos and reels are not posting in my account I have reported many times but no response from Instagram. When I post something it is showing as ""there was a problem rendering your video if this keeps happening u have to use another video"" what problem to my account please check and inform me.",1
Instagram is one of my favorite app. But now it's not working. I even uninstalled and installed it a few times! I've been trying to open it for how many weeks yet it's still on white screen. Please fix this.,1
"Since the last update, it hardly works. It wouldn't let me upload a post, would take forever to upload a story, and the translation feature doesn't work. The only thing that works (surprise surprise) is the reels section. For an app that was born as a digital photo album, not letting users upload images is the begining of the end.",1
"Wont load correctly, can only see a few posts regardless of what i do. Was great, but its been ruined",1
There seems to be issues with creating a new account or adding an account. I can't seem to get my old account back.,1
It keeps kicking me out of my Instagram page I had to make another account. It's not working well. Is there anyway you can fix my account. . I can't access my saved pages if I go to that page it kicks me out of the app.,1
My Instagram is not opening..... All I can see is a white screen..... ‡•§ ‡•§ Instagram Lite works but this interface is nothing like the main application and so I decided never to trust Instagram..... Many others are facing same problem..... It's probably messed up..... Please do something about it..... ‡•§,1
"1. app often does not show my story viewers 2. too many stupid yet mandatory features like ""my favourites"" were added 3. the homepage has been absolutely useless since you've added this ""view older posts"" garbage 08.2022 update All these developers and the application still works like some lame course project of a bright 11th grader who recently got into html",1
Needs a button to quickly and easily report and block the porn bots that constantly interact with my stories and dms.,1
"There's too much inappropriate ads! Especially on IG story. I've been reported a lot of inappropriate ads and Those ads are still there until today. I hate it so much. To Instagram developers and helpers, please monitor this application because there are also minors who use this app. Please reconsider this.",1
Black screen when trying to use Instagram app. Has been stuck on this for almost a month now. Have no issues with other apps.,1
"my main acc got completely banned for no reason and istg If u reply with ""well you probably went against our terms of service or our guidelines"" like everything else when i tried to get it back dont bother.",1
"I CAN'T OPEN my accounts n now I MUST use IG LITE! which very slow. I deleted this app & intended to reinstall due to one of accounts had been logged out and couldn't logged in, only white screen. But beforehand my another IG was good! Yet bcs I uninstalled this app, I cant open all of my accs. the screen showed the logo & from meta, then the screen ONLY showed white background without username & passwrd column to be clicked.

I use insta from past 6 years....but from almost a week it only show a blank screen and nothing....I tried to uninstall and install the app many times but Everytime it's just show a blank screen..... I already reported the problem.... AND PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM ASAP...,1
"App isn't opening, just shows a black screen. No issues of network either. + Its been a week already why is the app not working??!!!!! + IS INSTAGRAM EVER GOING TO FIX THIS? LIKE LOSING THEIR USERS TO A MERE GLITCH ISN'T EXPECTED FROM THEM! PLEASE LOOK INTO THE MATTER",1
The App is getting worse and worse because of so many fake profiles with bitcoin and trading and mining which hack your account. I guess Instagram has a profit from this otherwise i don t understand why would they allow these profiles to exists... you can identify from a mile away,1
"This app is annoying, it doesn't let me do anything!!I try to turn my camera on for it and when I do it automatically turns on to the choice option ""don't allow"" even when I didn't press it. Why make ""yes allow"" an option if it doesn't work?? I've installed and unstalled 4 times and still won't work. Fix it it gets on peoples nerves.",1
What in the world is going on with Instagram?? Full blown identity crisis... I have used this app for years and it has never been further from what it once was. Starting to make other platforms much more appealing.,1
"The app is stuck, it isn't using data niether from wifi nor from mobile , please fix this asap.",1
"Hello Instagram team, I'm not able to use instgram app, when I am opening Instagram app. It's not loading and only showing dark black page. Please fix this problem as soon as possible. Thank you.",1
"When i tried to log in the screen shows black , so i re-installed the app and then when i open it it shows ""instagram by meta"" like any other then it shows black screen. I think this is a bug ir something but please fix it üôè",1
The app constantly crashes and the amount of ads they shove down your throat is a joke.,1
Same issue on the 11th of Sept as mentioned here >> There's a major problem with the app especially after the latest update on the 14th of August. The app doesn't load up at all and it closes almost quickly within 1-2 seconds. I doubt it has anything to do with the smartphone otherwise the app would've given a notification saying that the older phones don't support the current or latest version of Instagram. Kindly look into this and resolve it at your earliest. Great app overall.,1
This app is becoming a bother to use. You guys keep putting some kind of ban on my account with only a error message popping up with absolutely no indication of why my account can't be Accessed.

Instagram was very good until my account was hacked 5 days ago and no one has bothered to help me no matter how many times I've contacted them and tried everything on the help pages. Not happy I'm gonna lose everything for my business because they can't be bothered helping,1

"I couldn't even put a comment on any of the pages why I don't know for what I don't know this is silly that I didn't any or disturb any one or say something against any thing or person can I know why and for what , I only could say that it's an unknown and unfair and uneven disingen that shows 2 faces in this app that shows one nice face for the people they want and the other people they don't want",1
Many glitches faces here many problem are showing my insta please launch your new functions and need update please not interested this Instagram oldz Instagram is best this new many problem faces üò§ please update need.,1
Timeline keeps getting more complicated. Why can't I just have a simple chronicle order like it used to be? Feel like Meta is getting greedier because now I have to open the app many more time to be able to see all my friends' posts while watching more ads.,1
"what is wrong with instagram??? i can't even open it and it has been days. i already did everything. deleting and reinstalling, refreshing the app & even restarting my phone but literally nothing appears. please do something about it.. i'm getting so tired of this app.",1
"Last update has made it totally unusable. As other users have mentioned, I currently cannot access my gallery to make a new post. The only pictures that come up are ones that I have already posted.",1
"the archive keeps loading, can't be opened. I need an archive of my stories on Instagramüòø",1

It cannot work properly My Instagram crash continuosly Many time there will glitches And many more problem And it contains too many ads,1
"Horrible isn't a good enough work for Facebook, Meta, Instagram's customer service! I get there are over a billion users, but algorithmic blocking post and having no answers to support messages is part of the DNA of Facebook and what they represent! Absolutely frustrating and disgusted!",1
"This app gets worse with time. Can't send videos/reels/posts at times in DMs. While trying to comment on a post, can't see what's being typed on the screen.",1
"Gallery wasn't showing all my pics no matter what I did. Resorted to uninstalling and reinstalling not knowing I'd have to create a new account. I lost everything--contacts, favorites, etc",1
My account got reported for no reason; my content was fully appropriate. My account seems to not be existing anymore and I can't do anything.,1
"Worst app, wastes your time. Also don't love em, don't hate em, but I do support free speech, which insta clearly doesn't. (T brothers).",1
"I had actually given 4 star to this app at first but now I kind of feel like it's a boring app, you don't fet your feed refreshed that same reel or post stays on top and the worst part is I've to hide every post that I've viewed or else it'll keep on popping... Do something about this.",1
I'm very disappoint from instagram application because I make videos and put that videos on drafts but suddenly I saw that my drafts folder is empty . I made so many videos but all are deleted automatically. What should I do üòî It's very disappointed üòî,1
Draw option not visible in my Instagram story. many times reported this issue but still not working.,1
Used to be a good app..but these days not even able to upload pic as a post or status. Please fix it,1
Ever since I updated this app I get a blank screen when I open the app....can't use the app at all...please check if the upgrades are compatible with all mobile devices as I'm on android. Very disappointing,1
"When I add a filter to a video it doesn't let me export it and it always says ""error"" and I've tried many things to make it not say that it happens when I have wifi and don't have wifi idk what to do",1
"I have latest version, but Reply and react to the DM is not available for me. If I open chat box's images, the send message and reaction icons in the chat box are got disappeared. Thanks",1
I am using vivo 21 5g and since a week the Instagram app is so choppy like it was never before. I would request the concerned team to look into it.,1
Every time I open instagram my explore page is more and more irrelevant. Horrible.,1
It's glitching and lagging me out of the call highly wouldn't recommend if you could fix it then that would be great,1
This is krazy. Why I can't log in to my account. It's always says that I need to try it again later. This is so annoying!,1
From few weeks I am unable to post anything. Whenever i am going to + icon nd selecting any option its not showing any photos from my Phone Gallery neither videos. What is the issue going on ? Please fix this ASAP. Really shameful.,1
I shouldn't have to enter a phone number to access the app. It doesn't matter whether or not other people can see it. I shouldn't have to enter a phone number.,1
After update I'm unable to access internet in Instagram...other internet apps are running well...so solve the internet issue by giving any update..,1
why can't i log in or sign in? i've installed it and updated it again and again and it still says that my username/email is not registered,1
"I've 2 accounts and i can only use messenger on one account, not on another account. Please instagram improve that feature.",1
I am uploading any video in the story it is blocking everything. Before too i have uploaded many videos this never happened. But these weeks recently i am facing this issue. Please resolve this problem and let me upload videos or scenes properly and with smooth functioning,1
"I didn't get any updates from Instagram, many times I reported a problem to Instagram, but no response from Instagram, worst app.",1
Latest update made the pictures look horrible I the feed. It has a bad frame adjusted to the color palette of the image but it looks really annoying. I don't want to post videos or 1080√ó1920 to adjust to this new update. Give people a choice of how they want their feed to look like. Stop making tik tok out of what was suppose to be a picture gallery,1
"Features are not available in my account & report many times but no change, Developer need to makeing apk perfect",1
I dnt know when I make a video cal to my friends on Instagram..I can't make cal wts wrong with this app ? Please make good about calls,1
"Reinstalled app and now I can't get back in. All I get is blank screen. Not to mention all the fake accounts and impersonators and we spend alot of money on adds, yet instagram can't even give a blue tick. Bad. Sort yourself out.",1
"It's not working properly,, it doesn't let me enter in the app like when i click Instagram it's just ""white blank screen"" i tried ininstalling and re-installing a lot of times and even reboot my phone but it just doesn't work pls fix it..",1
Unbearable new update. Looks sort of like a bad quality tik tok. White see-through text sometimes is barely seen on the photo. I'm unable to save posts to folders. Only can do that when I go to 'saved' and save every post through 'select'&'add to folder'. Makes it very tiring and unpleasant. Takes huge efforts to read every post and get information from there & react.,1
Remove block option from the Instagram app and disable the deactivate account option other then these. this is awesome application,1
"I used to really like Instagram but lately it's just a black screen when I open it up, and it doesn't fix even after I restart the app and clear my cache.",1
"My account got phished and I've contacted Instagram to no avail, I fail to understand why they can't help me so I'm giving it a 1 start.",1
"They blocked me from my account for no reason. Them and Facebook claim that I'm logging in from a different browser. LIARS, I have no other browser to use. I use my phone, just as I always have!!!!!!",1
Please fix it! It's not working . It keeps closing everytime I go to my page. I tried everything but it won't work,1
Only have this app because if you want to follow things your high school children do you have to do it. What a mind-numbing pile of garbage the whole Facebook meta experiences. The stupidity of the world is at it's zenith,1
New update : can't find English UK! I refuse to use the app with the US settings...,1
This app have became worst now a days i can't log in into the account please wait for sometime is the only think which is being displayed,1
terrible. Got a new phone and decided to make a new account every process was slow and buggy but I finally made an account as soon as I made an account I was banned,1
"The most recent update has made my user experience a nightmare. I'm mostly using IG while listening to music but now you can mute the reels and apps only temporarily, and then the app forgets it and stops music from other apps if there's any content with background music. I've already deleted & reloaded the app hoping that this would be fixed, and for a while I got the older version that worked amazingly before the app updated to this version again. Horrible, please fix this.",1
Again the same problem... Glitches and crashes ... It's not functioning properly..!,1
I update my Instagram so many times but this nots feature is not showing ü•≤,1
I have been reporting a problem from 15 days the issue is not resolved yet. @meta the worst social media app ever.,1
"Need to fix the bug asap, its so irritating to the point I won't even use ig for messaging.",1
"Can't log in, I was signed out so I changed my password that many times and can't get in through Facebook either I don't get why it's updated tried on my computer as well. Been trying to get help but not one has bothered I want to get back in to my account",1
After the update app doesn't work properly when I try to open it it just gets crash so plz Instagram solve my problem...,1
"Since I updated my Instagram app, it won't open anymore. Why don't you solve the problem of this app?",1
"Since I have had Instagram my account got hacked, passwords get changed, I tried to update my identification never worked, alot issues with Instagram still get these issues. My senses thiers third parties messing around my account, data is being shared",1
"Haven't seen a single post from anyone I follow in days. Nothing but hashtags, ads and suggested posts.",1
Instagram should add one feature for mobile application to check all sent request on Instagram easily on one click.,1
App doesn't work. It's showing a blank screen besides just one post from a week ago when it last worked. Seems like android has been forgotten by the developers again.,1
the reason why i am giving this app a 1 star is because they have been getting more and more new bugs just not to long ago i was using insta to talk to a friend of mine and waiting for my girl the next it starts shutting down and kicks me out i try to update the app on my computer and it wont work and i even tried using my computer and it is doing the same thing I would like to know as to exactly what is going on and why i see more and more bugs within instagram itself and i when it can be fixed,1
"Randomly has locked me out of my second account even though I have the correct password and email confirmation code. Makes me upload a video of myself and then denies me access because they ""can't confirm"" my identity. Yet, I continuously get friend requests and post comments on my other account from fake accounts and perverted men. Absolutely NO customer support! üëéüëé",1
"Okay. I really don't want to delete my account because I follow people I would like to keep up with. But that's the issue; if I have to tap twice after opening the app to see things from people I follow, that. Defeats. The purpose. Of. A. Follower. System! Instagram has made the app worse with updates before, but this truly crosses a line. They're trying to be TikTok so badly, but in the process they have lost at least me. If the main feature of your app stops working, I don't need it anymore.",1
Very very Bad Communication app...Very poor..only Good For Watching reels..Why always show the active Symbol when the person gone.....,1
"Wrong content prefer again and again, i report and block when see adult content but nothing happens.",1
Very bad experience my Instagram is updated but in my account there is no change new features is not add in my account üò∂,1
"Devs are too lazy to fix bugs on anything that isn't iOS. Reels act weird when you upload a pre-rendered video. No groups like facebook, No threads like twitter so if you don't pay for ads you're not going anywhere with your page. Ah yes and if you try mass following manually they'll restrict your account from following anyone (been restricted for like 48 hours so far). The app isn't like before, Instagram Department are greedier. Satisfying the investors is more important than satisfying us",1
"Its been long time that I'm facing issue with instgram, Its doesn't open properly, everytime I try to open it its stuck on white blank screen an I don't know what's the issue. I clear all caches and data and Install it again as we still there is the same problem. Let me know what should I do to rectify this issue.",1
"If I want to give stars to Instagram so l would give zero to it because of that One day l was peacefully using Instagram but suddently Instagram says"" YOU HAVE BEEN LOG OUT . after it suddently my Instagram stop working I couldn't do anything , after it I've to make new account thats why I've lost my saved post & audios . It have been 2 times that instagram log out my acc . It's very heart breaking",1
I can't go my account... My all information is right but when i try to go my Instagram account it's not opening.. Please set up this lack... Please help me,1
I using one plus phone also i can't use more filter option... automatically draft deleted.....once do reels and save in draft its saved without audio....only captured camera audio.....if u updating features....be careful its useful to us.....,1
The new update won't let me log in..... It gives me some error and sends me a OTP for some reason..,1
"Hello, please fix this bug, where whenever I try to tap the reel option when it's in post form, it crashes and whenever I try to upload the reel to my story, the background of the reel would show a pic of whoever I'm chatting with. And the tap long emoji option, 6 of them are showing the same emoji, but when I tap it, it sends an emoji, but I can't see clearly which is which. I tried uninstalling and installing it, doesn't work. My phone has lots of space too. It's the latest version too.",1
"during the past week insta has been slow to load posts, the text on posts will go off screen to the right so I can't read them, messages in chats will be out of order and the pictures people send are so big they take up almost half the screen, and when I tap the image it will be a bit smaller, but it will only show half of the image. this is now the 4th time this week I've uninstalled and reinstalled instagram, please fix this!",1
"It has become increasingly frustrating to upload photos. I spent this whole morning trying to upload a photo set and every time I went to post the photos, the app crashed and I had to start over. This happened over ten times. The bells and whistles to make this app look nice has taken away the functionality of the original app: to post pictures without me wanting to throw my phone across the room. But I know that no matter please solve it fast",1
Instagram has done nothing about the pornographic posts I repeatedly come across and report that are being forced onto my feed by memepages who almost exclusively post ads,1
"I was blocked by no reason. When I appeal, no feedback. If this is how to treat customers then I think the customer care needs an update. The contact phone number isn't working as well as the mails. If one experiences an issue, there's no way for the person to share the experience. I have been on IG for 4 years. But recently, I lost all appetite for it. I even wasn't prompted to open a new account after my former account was locked for no reason.",1
"Every time a video clip ends it automatically scrolls to the next one and it's really annoying. I'm capable of scrolling myself you don't have to do it for me? Also those follow suggestions in-between stories were a pointless and irritating feature. Stop messing with an app that was fine to start with and adding all these absolutely idiotic features that make it incredibly annoying to use. Thats only two out of countless horrible changes they've made, this is just a terrible app now",1
"The most annoying app ever existed on the play store. Darkmode keeps failing and makes the text unreadable (which hasn't been fixed for over a year now, just look at my edit history), can't even read a Reel's description for a minute because the app keeps moving the screen with ""SEE MORE OF VIDEOS AND STUFF"" alert, and it takes ridiculous amount of storage because images are cached for god knows why. The only good it's serving me is to be able to reach/reached by my friends, which fails as well.",1
"BRING THE NORMAL LAYOUT BACK!! The shopping option in place of the notifications is extremely unnecessary, I have not used it and never Will use that option. And the reels in place of new post addition button is unnecessary as well and I do not plan on using that feature either. The user interface of this app is anti-user friendly; for when the whole point of using Instagram was sharing pictures and socializing with friends it has now become a virtual shopping center shoved in our faces.",1
"Everytime I open the app it only show a blank screen. I have tried to uninstall and re install it, I have closed the app and opened it many times. I even restarted my phone so many times and I still cannot use it without seeing a blank screen . This was going on for days but this issue has yet to be fixed, please fix this. I have tried many things in an attempt to open the app but I still get the blank screen. This has been occurring since 2 July. Hope you will understand my problem. Thank You",1
It's enjoyable using this app but I have a big problem my music doesn't appear in my Instagram I don't why üòî,1
"Hello. I have an issue. I tried to post something, but it says ""photo can't be posted"". I tried several times with different size of the picture, different wifi & connection, still the same issue. I logged out and tried to login, but I can't and the app keeps crashing. I need to login asap. Please let me know what's the problem, or if there is something I could do to fix, or please fix it asap if it was a problem from the server. Thank you.",1
"The app was working perfectly fine until today! It kept failing to load my feed, failing to send and receive messages. As a result, I deleted the app and rediwnlosded it, that didn't fix it. I restarted my phone, but that didn't fix it. Now it won't let me log back into my account, saying there's a network error, despite how strong my WiFi is. I even tried it using mobile data. It did not work!! Please fix this bug ASAP!!",1
"Bugs in the update. My version is 106.0.0.24.118 and after the update i cannot go in to the individual profiles as when i click it, it goes in to a white background and only back button with perticular profile name is visible. In the search column all media is visible but when you try to go in to one story it goes back to the white screen and thats it.you dont see anything with regard to the picture or story. Pretty cool app but this bug annoys me.",1
"I've always used Instagram and it was okay, but with these recent updates the app is getting worse. The algorithms don't show people that I'm interested, adds are massive showing every 2 ou 3 posts, and now the DM list is so messed up, can't find the people, the sequence changed and people who were supposed to be on the top of the list disappeared. These problems really messes up the UX, the company should at least listen to it's users.",1
"saying goodbye to this app. i needed to factory reset my phone. but when i finally downloaded this app, they cant find my username. but has an option to change my password. i changed my password twice, tried to log in using facebook but still cannot find my username. bye.",1
"I hate when I'm in the middle of watching a video, go reply to a message and then when I'm back Instagram automatically refreshes to the top of the page and my video is gone. Spent 10 minutes scrolling down and couldn't even find anything that I've seen before. No thanks for stupid features like this!! And I have enough ram to keep the app running in the background it did not restart!",1
"My experience it's been great so far except for the customer service. Awful, awful service instagram! I have a business account and it's almost 1 year I lost the opportunity to use the music attachment and sharing stories where I'm tagged. I try to fix it. I try all the trouble shooting advice and email /texing the assistance but never ever hear from them. I have a business account not for joke but because I work with it, I need to solve problems if I encounter them! I hope someone will answer!",1
"This last update makes it so that when posting photos, it crashes after being in the photo editing thing for about 5 minutes. So you can't use the app for its sole purpose; sharing photos. Please fix this soon! Jan 17, 2019 update: still not fixed. I believe it crashes when there are too many edits on too many photos. i.e. like 2 edits each photo on 10 photos... do you really think that is an acceptable limit??",1
"Pathetically slow since last month and now it fails to open too. Reinstalled the app after deleting it but same, the screen goes black unresponsive forever.",1
"I love instagram but the new update is terrible. It looks ugly, is super clunky and doesn't work. I can't click to like/unlike things as the like button is too far down the screen and if I try to scroll, it just moves onto the next post. Plus trying to watch videos, the app will use the freeze frame photo and show me that and play the audio but won't show me the actual video. It's awful, I hate the new update. It's trying too hard to be like tiktok.",1
"It's absolutely atrocious. The algorithms seemingly change every week, and since when can you not post more than one story without everything crashing down? Also why are there always notifications about messages that won't go away whether you got a message or not? Also why does it keep crashing every time there is an update? This app just keeps getting worse and makes me want to set myself on fire! Please get your act together!",1
Been fantastic for years and just this month Nov 20 keeps stopping. Such a shame as we use for business and keeping in touch with people. Even uninstalling does not work for long. Very frustrating be great to know how to fix. Also the new lay out is awful and not as aesthetic. Our name in bold! Loads of ads which absolutely not relevant. Such a shame as was a brilliant platform to see friends news.,1
"Crashes too much, can't add stickers or gifs in Stories without the app crashing. Please fix that. Not very enjoyable to use at times. But I've seen worse. Edit: the last update caused an immediate crash when trying to open the app. Completely unusable. Now it has reached the ""worse"" threshold and deserved one star until it's fixed. Edit 2: Previous update fixed it but latest update caused the app to crash upon opening the app. Again. I'm not impressed. Still worth the 1-star rating.",1
"Update ruined it. I usually don't rate my apps but after the update, I could barely use the app. I have to restart the app multiple times just to be able to see my feed. It becomes un-clickable, it hangs up a lot, and the stories doesn't load correctly. I don't know what that update do but it just messed up the app for me. And no, it's not my internet connection or my phone. Before the update, Instagram was working more than fine for me.",1
App doesn't even open now .. updated and just keeps saying the app faced a bug reload or close the program,1
My I'd mbbs_dream_boy_sumit_6261 In this I'd i search songs for my story then any music is not appearing. Please try to solve this problem quickly,1
When did you try and become tick tock. You're not tik Tok stop trying just let us post photos.,1
There is something horribly wrong with Instagram. I haven't been able to like/comment since the past 4 days now despite sending multiple reports and complaints. And this isn't the first time it's happening. But this is the first time it's happening for a very long continuous period! I think Instagram needs to work on it's bugs more importantly than working on new updates.,1
App is crashing. Reels aren't appearing on friends feeds. App is generally getting worst with more trash being added to make it more tick-tocky nonsense... Not sure why?,1
"Much like the other complaints, all I see is a black screen. I got logged out and just an immediate black screen. I've uninstalled it, I've restarted my phone. Nothing. Please get this fixed.",1
"I gave it 5 stars some years ago, but now for the last 5 days I can't even access it. The login page is just blank and I can't even write my login details or do anything else. Horror!!! And I work with some clients whose accounts I can't even access and now what should I do, I already waited these five days for the developers to fix the issue, but it's not happening. How about you do it a bit faster? And before you release new update, test it for different devices, how about that.",1
My reels have been uploading upside down for over a week. There's no fix.,1
"So many bots. Also my account is public, someone randomly liking my stories but can't see them in the list of who viewed my stories",1
Haven't done anything still it's restricting my activities not able to access reels and posts üò°üò°üò° worsts experience It's request to resolve the bug,1
"Instagram is getting worse every day. I don't know what you did, but there are a lot of bugs. When I go to someone's Account, the program immediately crashes. When a Story is sent to me via Direct Message, it is impossible to see it, it simply does not open, I have to close the program and then restart it so I can look. There are many more little bugs. You ruined Instagram to the fullest. Stop adding new meaningless updates. Correct any errors.",1
"Reels aint posting, the are just getting backed up with no explanation at all or any reply back from support team.",1
Your app has many bugs Like while posting story the story doesn't posted & main reason is that reels are not running.....,1
"Used to be good, I hate reels, I hate the suggested posts. I just want to see posts from people I know, or care to follow. Didn't used to mind the odd advert. But the suggested posts are so annoying.",1
"It's a buggy mess, it puts Zuckerbird's wants above those of its users, and it does everything it can to weasle its way into violating your privacy. It's trying so hard to be Tik Tok that it is no longer Instagram. Instead, it has basically become discount Tik Tok.",1
"The app on its own whims and fancies often stops you from liking posts and reels and no matter how much you complain for months and months, they wont give a damn. With each update the app is getting commercialized and in operations its getting worst by each passing second.",1
"Absolutely hate that all videos now are uploaded as ""reels""... my videos are pretty low in the algorithm given, but I still used to get likes & comments. Now I get none of either. Absolutely stupid change that Facebook made to what should be a separate platform.",1
"Can you guys just stop recommending random videos on my feed???? I just want to watch my friends photo, not stupid random videos!!!!! You guys just don't have your own identity. Erghhhhh!",1
The chats theme is gone in my id and the message is not being replied to and the option of reels is also not showing.,1
"Ffs what happen to this app now, just in one month this app asked me countless times to verify my account and it get worse because they force me to change my password, and ofc must not be the same as the old pass. I just use one third party ig story viewer app from playstore which is okay/secure, but this verification shhit always happen smh.",1
"Anything that Zuckerberg owns, doesn't take long to become toxic. Insta was a happy place, but from the last few years it's a polarizing toxic hell full of people without common sense and bad/fake journalists making memes with half baked news just for reactions. It's so bad for people with anxiety. Instagram feels like an imposter that is pretending to be everything but itself. It's trying to be tiktok, snapchat, youtube, etc. And not being the photo app that we all loved. Stop pushing videos.",1
I am unable to get notes feature on Instagram. Even after updating my Instagram more than 2 times,1
Horrible app lately. Keeps force closing every time I check notifications. It closes app. Just updated it and it's still crashing. Useless app at this point,1
"Absolutely terrible update. It looks as if you were trying to imitate tik tok and failed miserably in the process. The UI loads at random, on some posts it loads and on others it doesn't. The stability is also terrible. Sometimes the app works. Sometimes it crashes when looking at stories. Sometimes it crashes when simply opening the app. Seriously, a social media giant such as meta can't justifiably mess up this bad at making an app work",1
While I'm writing on page I can't see it until the keyboard scroll down then I can see it please fix the issue on Instagram app,1
In Instagram explore page it is showing Nature and architectural images. not that recommended post which I have liked. It is showing irrelevant content that seems like your account is hacked.,1
I have already notified Instagram team about my issue to see the list of my latest following and they haven't respond thats not professional.,1
App not working properly since 2 days suddenly not working I uninstalled app and reinstall it but not working properly do meet full,1
Since yesterday the app has become unusable for posting. Won't access phone gallery and no clear route described to fix. Meta - if ain't broke stop trying to fix it!!!,1
"no inovation on the platform in years, and it keeps crashing whenever I try to read any articles. easily replaced by other social media platforms.",1
When I checked others people's profile it comes load again and again please fix this problem. As soon as possible,1
Everything is a Reel now and you rarely see posts from your own followers til 2 days later if at all. You work hard on a reel for it to get 2 views just because you didnt follow the trend of the same posts music that everyone else is using. So you stop for a while and get punished because of it and get even less exposure!,1
Such a poor customer care center . I will report many times my Instagram id swipe reply bug but Instagram team don't reply it ... rubbish support,1
"When I try to open the app all it shows is a white screen, I've tried restarting the app, my phone, I've tried force stopping it, uninstalling and reinstalling it but nothing works!",1
"I can't even open it. It just shows a black screen. It's not the Internets fault since I can open it in my other device. I restarted my phone, I uninstalled and installed it again, I tried everything.",1
"Ever since Instagram crashes, I can't open my IG anymore in the application. Where can I report? I can't even log in my username. Everytime I open my app, only white screen appears. My phone is perfectly fine, all my apps are running except for instagram.",1
"Too many ads, timeline has too many suggested posts, emoji reacts are super limited on Android for no reason.",1
"App won't show any of my pictures when I try to make a post. When I try to select from any of the apps on my phone that house pictures, the app crashes.",1
"2nd attempt. My reels are still posting to my page upside down. I can't post reels to my business page I don't know what's going on, but first I couldn't boost, keeps saying error, then my reel was upside down, so deleted the app and reinstalled. Now I cant even make a reel. There's not even an option. Please fix.",1
"Latest update messed up experience. It imitates tiktok poorly (why did they do this? what for?), privileging reels and videos (most of them from accounts I don't even follow) over picture feeds, the captions on the post are truncated and the 'see more' option (to display the full captions) is not working! It is difficult if you are trying to locate a specific post, and the audio icon is gone, so I can no longer mute or unmute the feed as I watch... uff. Not happy at all.",1
I hate you guys... After few days of smooth log in i have to face that stupid problem that i can't log in in my account without any reason. Thats totally unfair that my id is not upgraded.i Don't know whats the problem. I have been trying for several times to log in in my account but i am failing everytime.,1
Horrible dont ever use them . I will never again they took down my account and my fb also got taken down (due to something that went against thier Instagram stupid guidelines ) i linked my fb account to Instagram and the fb ive had since 2012 gone completely permanently . . What ever happened to free speech and human rights üí¨ . I hope that fb and Instagram gets taken over in future by someone who understands free speech üí¨... red umbrella rights are human rights . Indigenous world rights .,1
"Spam bots Galore! Currently I get 40-50 notifications daily of new followers, new likes, liking comments, etc... unfortunately all of thing are coming from spam bots of ""girls"" trying to get me to click their Webcam or ""sex"" chat link. Report these bots as porn or spam and Instagram does nothing. So I spend my day blocking these bots only to get another 50 bots the next day. Instead of fixing this Instagram adds a note feature that isn't really worth much. Quell the bots or keep 1 star.",1
Hey dear Instagram It's a very good app but when i try wanna change my highlight cover then it take too much time and after that it was not change. I'm in very troubling plz solve this problem. With this review i wanna give it only one star. Plz fix this problem for...,1
"Locking part of my FB, and I can do nothing about it, as the account I had for this no longer exists. Had no use in it before, and I hate it now.",1
"My istagram has completely stopped working and I don't know why. I tried updating it, unistalling it but it still doesn't work. The screen I completely black when I open it and I need you guys to fix it fast please.",1
"The further info for updates its constantly not provided by the developers. Why aren't you being transparent with your users? its frustrating and insulting. Reels consistently disappear off of the app, they take videos down if you use music provided by THEIR library, reels can't be uploaded and you can't recover it as a draft and it stays at the top of your page. For some reason my reels are also getting the text on it duplicated. Cool, now it cuts my reels.",1
Sometimes there is problem too much update and sending problem,1
I does not get the features of refress the Instagram feed please solve the problem which I was faces from 5 days .,1
"2fa not sending text message, some highlight not load",1
Really its a very bad experience... My first account had closed because of facebook app. I lost too much of my variables pic what i cant really have it again .. I didnt trust your app. To save my photos and my memory You can decide to erase all of tgem as a bunchment ...,1
"This app has to be the most glitchy app out there on social media ... It constantly freezes, dark mode goes half light/ half light frequently, videos don't play when you are scrolling through feed and freeze on a frame, when in messages, I constantly have to close the app and reopen it to be able to press ""send"", and that's just to name a few.... For meta to have such billions of downloads and dollars, surely they can afford to make one. Simple. App. üëé",1
"It used to be good but it's been unbelievably glitchy recently. The draft function doesn't work, the story text glitches, I have to try 2 to 5 times before things post without glitching. Sometimes it splits and stretches your photos if you post more than one. Sometimes it crashes and you loose your post draft, things don't load. I have to keep refreshing my page because it sometimes just shows old posts from a year ago, lots of bots, spontaneous drops in followers, and quality drops in artwork..",1
I don't know why suddenly my account closed or logout but It can't make login to my account the password also not access please make the instagram password secure to login,1
"Please fix dms, friend sent video and I cannot watch. Notification sits there even though they deleted it. I deleted app, cleared cache, etc. It won't go away. When I tried to watch, it would only load. Please fix",1
Since the last update I have not been able to send anything to my friends. I've uninstalled and updated countless times with no success. I've emailed too and had no response.,1
As my instagram account is hacked this app is not safe to use please suggest some recovery precautions or any suggestion to delete my hacked account so that it should not create any issues.,1
I love it... But no dark theme if you don't have emui 10... So 3 stars till that is fixed... Not all will get emui 10 and now it does not davw pw,1
There should be post archive on every video and photos....I can't archive my posts and i also don't want to delete it...So for this problem i very much fed up with instagram.... Some Time i want to delete my account....may be me and my friends will do it soon...if there is no changes... We want to see who didn't followed us back...its really shame for instagram that they couldn't show us who didn't followed us,1
Experience is almost good but have a lot of issues sometimes show some huge bugs without crossing the limit,1
Way too many bugs. No wonder other platforms are taking over. It's a creators nightmare,1
"My feed is full of adverts & follow suggestions, some of this content I find offensive. It's mostly annoying videos. I've switched off notifications as they're useless. I want to see my family & friend's posts not strangers posts. Please roll back & prioritise what I follow not all this garbage",1
"Please fix this issue: (Samsung Galaxy M51) Whenever i open my app, Blackscreen/ Whitescreen (according to theme) pops up after a few seconds of loading of logo. App never loads up the homepage. Tried: Reinstall, Clear cache & data, rebooting. Review!",1
"I'm unable to get into my account I switched phones and I keep getting an error message ""Sorry There Was a Problem with Your Request"" in red letters. I'm a content creator and this is causing problems for me. Please help me!!!",1
The app gives too many glitches please fix this issue and also My followers stop counting it stuck at 699 in my profile but in others account when I open my profile my followers seen 708 please fix this isse right now,1
I have to send out multiple bug reports every single day to get my followers number updated. It's just stuck at certain number despite getting new followers on daily basis. Worst app ever! Doesn't even deserve 1 star for causing too much of inconveniences to it's active user!,1
From past few weeks I'm not able to use the app firmly.. have to delete the app n re install it couple of times n still it's malfunctioning,1
its a very good application for making videos but sometimes apps back and many times its want feedback and its takea very data,1
The IG Filters are not working!! Please fix it. I already reset my phone and reinstall the application but nothings happen it's stillthe same. I cant use the filters on making STORY. Wth.!!,1
The app is cool n all..but recently for the past one month..I am just not able to log in through this app..All it shows is a blank screen. So I have been using the lite version tho..but it's clearly not that good..so I wud like my instagram to be fixed..for me to login and use it.,1
"I recently started using the app again and was reminded why I nearly deleted my account. Within an hour of logging in I was hacked, and had to remove 12 linked Facebook accounts from my IG that I had not enabled. Since regaining control of my account I have been blocked from liking posts for having used paid followers, of which I don't do as I am both broke and haven't used the app in over a year. It's far to easy for anyone to get your account information and I'm close to deleting altogether.",1
"Not working properly, only allows to watch the first 2 stories, everything else crashes",1
Getting worst experience nowadays I don't have option of react and reply to chat also reported in the app also 2months ago till not got any response and this issue is not fixed.....hope this will fix. Soon!!!!&now I am unable to open the app... worst experience ever.!!!!!!!!,1
"Too Many fake bot accounts and scam/misleading adverts. Also, please sort out the zoom/rotate issue when uploading multiple photos as a post. We need a function to adjust individual images uploaded and zoom function",1
"Suspended my account I've had since insta started, for no reason and I can't even recover it then tried making a new account and as soon as I used a totally different email and everything that account also got suspended. Only thing I've ever posted is my family and pets so please explain",1
Very bad app before the update was superb and after update it got waste.whenever my friend send me massage I got also all massage But I Can't see the massage in massage box so I have to refresh the massage interface two timesüòìüòì,1
Drains my data while barely using the app (with background usage off) and the option for data saver to not automatically load videos doesn't actually do anything and still automatically loads videos :/,1
"I Didn't Like This Policy Sometimes it block messaging system for 3 days For going against community guidelines But , It Should Have To Send A Warn Message Then , It Can Block Messaging For 3 days ‚òπÔ∏è",1
"IG keeps flagging my reels for copyright infringement, despite IG themselves providing the music used. Then when I open a dispute explaining this issue, they immediately and automatically remove the reel entirely. The music on these reels is offered by IG themselves, and I add it through their app. If the music THEY PROVIDE IN-APP can't be used, then why do they provide this feature? ALSO: The number of bots on Instagram is INSANE‚Äîyou would be mad to spend money on ads with IG üí∏üí∏",1
"Need,to,fix,login issue its show the,error user name not found same if i try with same user name on instagram lite i can login. Fix it",1
This is very bad app bcz I am trying to post anything but a green screen occurs and I can't post anything and can't shared any memory on story üò°,1
My account hacked 2nd time today unable to recover it. Too worst security which was maintained here. Many of my colleagues have reported the same without reason their accounts got disabled today. #Boycottinstagram,1
"Hello team Instagram, I have done every possible thing to get quick reply option available in my message section but it says that it is not available in my region seems there is some problem with account. I want quick reply option available in my account. Please help me to get it as soon as possible. Thank you",1
"Reels is utterly broken. Pre-recorded video (from your phone gallery) fails nearly 100% of the time. The app constantly crashes. Text doesn't stay in place on the timeline, especially with different fonts. Editing cover image is not possible, as it flips your vid (So frames flip) Takes a whole day for 15 seconds & then it loses it or corrupts it. Given the bias for reels, this biases AGAINST Android users. Don't waste your time! Pick Tiktok! Latest updates are still breaking text",1
It keeps asking me for a phone number.i don't want to put my phone number. I still did it and it does even upload it stays loading.,1
"What is going on with Instagram? Since these updates I can no longer access my 2 business pages through my personal page. This is so upsetting I wish you app creators would just leave things alone, everything was working fine. I don't even know if my business pages still exist because I can't even add them to my personal page!! I gave you 1 star but if you had a ""0"" rating you would get that!!",1
"Very bad experience , if your account has been hacked then Instagram doesn't help you to recover it .",1
"I am facing following issues after recent updates 1) when i upload a reel, the video is uploaded upside down by Instagram 2) recently uploaded reel video is always shown as draft also. when i delete it, instagram deletes upload video too",1
I don't have collaborate option and also quick reply option,1
"If you log out of your account, you can not log in back. Uninstalled, redownloaded, restarted my phone, but all you get is a black screen. I can not use the app! Please fix asap!",1
"Instagram has been driving me crazy lately. I can't post videos that actually come out properly, I can't use the music sticker on my story or else instagram will crash and continue to do so every time I open the app until I reinstall it, and very often it just freezes at the top of my feed and I can't scroll down. Very annoying!!! Edit: Instagram follower requests also keep showing up even though I turned push notifications off.",1
"Good app, I've just had trouble leaving comments recently. When I hit reply, my keyboard just won't open up. I thought it might be because I'm on an older version, but I updated and the issue is still there",1
My account has been shadowed for over 2 years now ...what's up with that ? One of the worst apps I have yet to use..it totally sucks,1
"I do not know what is going on with Instagram lately, but there has been so many glitches. I would not be notified if someone messaged me or is able to see new messages in the chats unless I refresh. Today was the worst of the glitches I've experienced. I uninstalled and installed the app hoping to get rid of those glitches, but when i opened it again after reinstalling it, all that appeared is a black screen with nothing on it, other than my own notification bar & still is. Very disappointing.",1
"I'm trying to delete my account because I have 2 accounts in Instagram, i'm trying from 30 minutes and not be able to find the permenantly delete option , you guys are making platform tough to use , I'm out of temper now , even the newly update is totally trash , it stucks , and in not getting a emoji reacting option in message box , trash",1
What a disaster of an app. The algorithm makes zero sense and nothing works properly.,1
"Instagram is way far from the good social media it was someday, Since it became a comercial tool. The interface changes every single day. The user don't even get time to get used to it. And of course, The censorship and lack of freedoom of speech! You are only allowed to say whatever is inside of their wrecked beliefs.",1
Very bad experience with Instagram. I am not able to see my story view. Sometimes I get problem with highlights. now it has become bad.,1
A successful story approaching to an end. Unfortunately instagram is going down the hell very fast. So many issues with the app besides the lost in identity they wanted to develop the app but ended copying snapchat (4.3) and tiktok (4.7) and they still struggling in (3.7) I highly recommend a (serious) improvement in all aspects otherwise this app will end sooner than expected. The negative feedback is alarming but developers seems to do nothing at all fixing the issues.,1
You guys don't listen to us.I reported about the reply option problem several time but you guys can't even fix that.Too much glithes loaded in this app and improve your photo quality and video limit. #youneedtolistentous,1
"Too many commercials! Too many garbage post, Instagram the old version way much better . Now ig it's only about business who gonna pay for this and that . Just pretty much rubbish . I miss the old IG . Where people admire other people picture without even have to pay a penny üôÑ",1
Videos ah dropping frame rates while playing. At one point app gets crashed whilst video is droppinf frames where it cannot play anymore but the audio is playing correct.,1
My experience while using insta is good in starting but after some time it is not working properly. I put lots of efforts while making vedio but my views and followers are decreasing day by day. I can message lots of time in insta message box but my problem is not sort out.,1
"Seems like Instagram was able to access my contacts whilst i had the permission blocked, i wonder how that came to be.",1
Camera not working properly.. Elongated picture is abled in camera.. which makes the photo and videos look elongated.. Facing this issue for more than 6 months.. It's a request to Instagram to fix it!,1
"Update: I can't even access my account now since the update so cheers! Need to run a business Why do you keep removing features? I had the ""add yours"" feature for stories for ages and now its gone!! I can't even interact with other people's. Makes no sense",1
"The app's functional on my phone for years even if I don't open it most of the time. However, nowadays whenever I open it up - even after not using it within less than 12 hours - my feed could not refresh nor load new content. I tried checking my internet, and any other app loaded fine; I can play HD videos on youtube without it needing to buffer. I've reinstalled this app numerous times to solve the issue, just to post one story. Hopefully this can be resolved soon.",1
I can't change my password even when the reset code was accepted on both of accounts pls fix this now I can't even post anything on.account this is really not cool.,1
"How can we record voice message on Instagram?? Because, I'm unavailable to record my voice message in Instagram it is not working very well. Please resolve this problem.",1

"Instagram has always been my favorite social media until I traveled, since then my account was locked. I tried to open it but no success. I have requested for code thousand times, no code was sent. Contacted the help team through my FB, no response came. So, i think you deserve half star, until I'm sorted out. Even now, the team has refused to review my comment, and try to gve me some help.",1

Absolutely pathetic for an app with so much money I've deleted 30√ó through so many braindead problems that should never happen especially when you block permissions in your phone from apps that it needs to get your information from it will automatically ban your account and you can't sign back in complete garbage app I recommend Twitter,1

"I really used to love this app, as I'm a musician and instagram had been a great medium for promoting my music and developing a loyal fanbase. but nowadays the app is majorly bugged and has become extremely annoying. There's an extreme amount of bots liking my stories and most of the times the app doesn't consider it necessary to show the chat of the person who has messaged me. The notification section doesn't work right at all and you really need to do something to make this app great again.",1

"New update is trash. Can't read the captions in videos because the caption of the post is blocking it. Hard to read the caption of the post with a light background. Scrolling is clunky. Can't click into the comments of certain posts because when you scroll to click on them, it goes to the next post. Absolutely terrible decision. Makes it virtually unusable. Don't usually write reviews but this update is so bad I am making an exception. Deleting the app until it is reversed.",1
"I loved Instagram a much, but i recently came up with a problem, i had an account named ""jakeboyce_thekid"", i had all my friends on it, but then suddenly for no reason it got temporarily locked, the reason said that i had used my insta password on some other website that looks like insta, but i did not..

Honestly could go on and on about how inconvenient this app is, unfortunately I still have to use it for work but they desperately need someone to go and fix things.",1

I give one star ‚≠ê someone changed my email and I can no longer get in my account I tried everything. It's not fair and horrible for people to do this. I can't get access to my pictures. Instagram should have some way that's easy to get our accounts back when we get hack.,1

"The old Instagram is just perfect. The new Instagram is so annoying, whenever i took selfie the result is gif. Also they removed the multi-capture, now that they remove it u need to take selfie one by one and the results is gif grr.",1
I am sorry but I I think the app is very un fair and not reasonable for the simple fact that I my self have had to create three times my account because they just take it down with out asking anything or even given a chance to the person. For example I placed so much work and effort like spending time money to make cosplays and followers by going places and all for them to just take it down whe ever they feel like it. To be honest I have given up on them long time ago.,1
"No customer support, App is filled with bugs and ready to take your money. I advise you all to delte this application",1

"I dont know what happened but lately my Instagram just hasn't been sending messages to chats no matter how long I wait or how many updates are put out and when I decide to uninstall and reinstall it suddenly my account has an extra security system I never turned on, so now I'm just forced to not have access to my account anymore",1
I'm just too fed to reporting a glitch past one month on my business account. I'm trying to promote my post & the app literally says something when wrong while redirecting to payment gateway. The Instagram team never responded nor resolved the issue. Really loosing lot of business deals due to this issue & seems like you guys don't really care,1
It's just ads and stuff you don't want to see. Good luck finding any of your friends in the endless dross. Also: now it is impossible to do a post with multiple images. Why is this app so terrible?,1
Please just go back to the old insight setting. The updated one keeps crashing the app. This happens on multiple accounts and devices.,1

My account is temporarily locked and my phone number to recover it the one from years ago that I do not own anymore. I still have access to my email that I use to login but somehow it does not bring as an option for me to use to get tye code to access my account. There is no form to fill for temporarily locked accounts. There's one for deactivated ones but I cant use that as it says my account has not been deactivated. I don't know what to do or how to get help to access my account.,1
This app sucks after update It still sucks it will not even load the app no more after the update just shows a blank screen been going on for 3 weeks now tried everything I can and it still will not load anything but a blank screen PLEASE FIX ASAP.,1
Its not being updated and even if its being I'm not being able to reply to certain text nor able to react on message except heart emoji,1
"Whenever I open the app, all I see is a blank white screen. I haven't been able to connect with friends for weeks now. Very frustrating and disappointing. If I could give zero stars I would.",1
This app is very amazing but I think we should have search option in save so we can easily find our saved videos,1
"App is not working. After installing the app when I open it only black screen appears. I tried re-installing the app, but it's not helping. Please resolve my issue.",1
New: They removed the 60 seconds story feature. 200822 Edit: The following is fixed. (Can't share songs to Instagram story anymore. Even after reinstalling both apps. 300321),1
"Instagram keeps logging my account out. Keeps saying we suspended your account because it is not visible on Instagram and it is not seen. I keep logging in and have to change password multiple times. It's extremely frustrating, annoying. What is wrong with my Instagram account?",1
"I can't see messages and its taking more time to load feed, and so many issues while operating app üò™",1
The app is overall good but the chat pinning option is still not resolved. This is making the app worst.,1
Instagram app is not responding!! Can't login!!! Installed and reinstalled many times but still the same!!! Screen goes blank!!! Can't see login option!!! Please fix this as so many have report the same last month!!!!,1
"As a creator and photographer it's incredibly frustrating to see how much they are leaving photos behind. The latest update looks bad, functions bad and is overall a copy of Tiktok. I sincerely hope they retrieve this awful experiment and give the user the ability to choose what format they want, without coloured backgrounds. It truly takes away from the good they did in the past as it seems the app is just a quick money maker without any regard for user experience now. Disappointed.",1
Text to speech feature does not exist in reels... I cannot post reels when the volume of the music and camera voice are different... when I post like that the music becomes a total white noise,1
Whenever i open my Instagram network gone automatically why this i face repair this problem immediately this is totally useless I don't like this app fix this problem otherwise i uninstalled this appü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨,1
I've been unable to upload any posts for 3 days now if they're more than 1 photo or video. It's ridiculous,1
Worst experience ever with this app so many glitches and the draw feature doesn't work for me :( @Instagram,1
My account has been hacked for weeks now and Instagram has not responded to any of my emails or attempts to get support. Your only method of facial recognition doesn't not progress with I structures on turning your head. My hackers have removed my email address and phone number which makes it difficult. I don't even believe Instagram have a support unit disgraceful.,1
"When using the call feature without using the camera, the app automatically will put your phone on sleepmode if any movement/touch is made in front of the front facing camera. This is incredibly inconvenient as it makes me unable to use my device for anything else or to even open the call into full screen as the minimised box for it may be on the top half of my screen.",1
App is terrible Messages won't load. Profiles won't load. My feed won't load. I can't comment or like posts and if I can only two photos will show before the feed hangs. It never used to be this way.,1
"Instagram doesn't care about users comments and support requests, many users are having trouble with instagram features, like they don't have new options or can't reply in direct chat, but instagram ignores them and doesn't have any plan to rollout new features for them. (I'm one of those users).",1
My account just gone. Nothing. I cannot even log in. Tried to recover account but failed. Hope this is just a bug.,1
Background audio of my reel has been disappeared...and the app does not provide me option to change it.or replace it as such you tube..as well as ...if the music is copyrighted then why it is in inapp music searches....,1
"After the new update i am not able to share reels it shows ""failed to send"" and once it shows failed to send i am unable to send messages as it also shows ""failed to send"" . Please look after this issue . Thanks",1
"The notifications when people post are kinda silly. I saw one of my friends post 24 hours ago and Instagram gave me a notification of a recent post, saying that ""PERSON_NAME hasn't posted in a while"".",1
Almost every time me and my friends had problems sending messages and it still hasn't been fixed,1
Not getting my swipe reply option and the other reaction icon also nd i tried my best and all the ways to do get rid of this glitch but nothing happened,1
"Most recent update crashes constantly after a few seconds of opening. I've reinstalled, cleared cache, force stopped, rebooted my phone...this app is literally unusable.",1
"Reels template option does not appear from the + sign menu. Existing reels suddenly don't show insight data. Once reel is removed from grid, no option appearing to add back to grid. Samsung s10e",1
"Am not really enjoying this app, my story post doesn't upload, my reels take more than an hour uploading.",1
"My 3rd review in 3 days. And now the app is somewhat unusable. Cannot upload stories and random times when you double tap to like a post, the app crashes. What's with all the garbage updates?",1
There are so many glitches. Not working properly. App legs when I use most of the time,1
"This update is very bad, because when i make a reel and save it in draft, and see some time later the song was detected automatically.plz instagram team fix this problem. Thank you. üòá",1
"Since the update, my reel captions overlap, the app crashes when I try to use professional insights, a reel I posted and tagged people in stopped working and directed them to some other random persons account. The continuous scroll on your main feed is irritating, it's hard to find the main caption for a post depending on formatting. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. This is very frustrating as a user. Putting in Bug reports appear to do nothing. My account is still doing the same things.",1
"Hi sir My Instagram account is not working as usually others instagram account, there are some problems in it like swipe reply of any perticular message and also making problem in applying chat theme, it is not showing any option for chat theme. Please make any update for solving this. I had try many methods but it's not working. Please solve it.",1
"Recently my app is riddled with issues. If I try to edit photos, and I hold down to see the before, it wrecks the entire edit and I have to start again (eg all the colours change, it zooms to one side, none of the edit sliders do anything, can't zoom at all) it's getting out of hand. Even if I force close, there are some edit features I can't touch at all without it ruining the picture. And posting multiple pics is also failing, the last picture I do always turns into a diagonally zoomed mess.",1
"So idk what is happening. Every time I enter the app I get a blank white screen, and no it is NOT my internet connection because all my other apps works well. I've restarted my phone several times and it still happens. I've uninstalled and re-installed the app about 6 times now and it's still happening. If you start a light version and the browser version and that works perfectly fine. PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP!!!!!",1
"It has been 2 weeks since I cant open my instagram. The screen shows Meta and just went blank. I have been installing and uninstalling my instagram apps but nothing change. Still, a blank screen. Please suggest me what to do to get the app back as normal. Thank you",1
What is going on the Instagram app the videos are not downloading why what's the problem if any issue lets us put notifications otherwise we will uninstall the app,1
"I did like this app but now if it downloads, it will instantly uninstall, forces itself closed and now my wife cant get back in. This is crazy ah and until its fixed u will not get anymore stars from me. To make it worse it's now forcing itself closed. Fix it and the stars will go back up, but until then it stays at 1 star.",1
"I don't understand what happened with instagram , the algorithm became terribly bad for those who create art/photography ,it has A LOT of glitches , the assistance is horrible, I lost my main account and what did instagram did? Nothing üôÇ , try to make your app better INSTEAD of copying tiktok, if I want to use tiktok I WILL USE TIKTOK , MAKE INSTAGRAM INSTAGRAM AGAIN.",1
This app sucks. I can't login. It shows try again later all the time. Recently i deactivated my account for some personal reasons and now i can't reactivate my account! Instagram says my username doesn't belong to an account. How am i supposed to get my account reactivated?I can't log in to reactivate my account as it says try again. I have important information in my account. Instagram please fix this issue.,1
I follow a few selected people and my feed is filled up of people I don't no that Instagram have suggested to me with clips I have no interest in what's the point of an app that shows you things you don't want to see? Advertisement sponsored every post and not my own friends ridiculous ( 2022 this has gotten worse),1
"This app was very good. But since I've uninstalled this app taking a break due to my exams, now I'm facing a problem. After installation of this app again I'm just getting a Blank screen without any option to login aur sign in. If there are any other facing such problem so please look after this issue asap.",1
"It is a really annoying, when I am trying to delete my account, it is asking to re-enter my password but when I give forgot password it is asking login details again recived one msg with URL when I open it it goes again to same page and there is no option to reset it, worst app",1

My news feed won't load at all it won't show me any new post please fix,1
The stickers options aren't available for some strange reason. I need this fixed. Ives uninstalled. Reinstalled. Updated. And the sticker option when posting a story is unavailable,1
Instagram needs to do so much better to protect children there's so much going on in Instagram that needs to be addressed and one of them is protecting children's rights and not allowed children to have Instagram until 13 years old,1
I'm deleting this app until you idiots can figure out how to make all of the comments and replies show up like they do through the browser. I'm tired of going Back looking for replies I've made or replies on a post and them not showing up in the app,1
"No customer service. Glitch with Reels create static. And no customer service to repair the problem. I tried updating it, restarting phone, tried different videos and songs still same problem",1
app is not working..Whenever I go to login account..app closes automatically üòë.. please fix this problem quickly,1
App needs a fix. Anytime a tag people or they tag me the tags go into msgs and I'm not liking that at all. Please put it back to the way it was.,1
It needs a rebuild. It's dark mode keeps lighting up once you open a link. It can't open my full gallery to upload videos and pictures. It's the worst app in my phone rn,1
"I couldnt open the app. I've been turning on and off my phone , but the app still doesnt work.. I still have fhe same problem. I couldn't open the app and add multiple accounts.please fix",1
"Disappointed by the app , Not able to open stories and also the app keeps crashing !!",1
"I really don't like the latest update! It's impossible to read a post. Text gets over the photo and in case there's a caption on the photo, everything blures. Sounds are on by default on everything (posts, reals, stories and other), it's irritating and I can't find how to mute it. App is way slower than it was. It simply turned into tiktok with a senseless flow of reals and videos. Video playing has multiple bugs. UI is not user-friendly, it gets even more annoying with each update",1
Facing a black screen problem while opening the app. I have tried everything but all in vain.Kindly do help me. I am using instagram lite now but there are many missing features in it. Kindly do something about it. Thank you,1
"The feed is so messy. I really don't like how each picture there's a background canvas that comes with it. It gets even more messier because every single post has a different background canvas color. I don't like that it has a lot of designs now, the minimalist design is gone. Almost everything in the new update is really bad. I'll prefer the old versions so maybe I'll just get those and not update the app any longer.",1
"The last UI change is just bad, they want to be Tiktok and every post looks like a story. You can't scroll through several posts at once because the UI locks the screen on every post, you need to keep swiping to go through them. You cannot turn off sounds by default so you can't use the app in public places anymore without looking like a jerk who doesn't know how to use a phone. Text on posts is almost unreadable now because the background is the photo. One ad every 2 posts. This is just awful.",1
"The new look only let you see in grid. The list, it is more comfortable. I can't use the DMs as before. Messages doesn't send, sometimes I see the preview of messages I receive but doesn't appear. I need to close the app & open it so the messages send (sometimes they are erased) or appear. Replying stories crash the app. there's even a button that is out of the screen & can't use. now i can't be even 10 seconds & it crash!",1
"Awful new test update!!!!! This new test roll out of the full screen display mode is awful!!! I hate how messy it looks, photos are not displayed in their full right. IG has truly forgotten its roots and just wants to be tiktok 2.0. My feed is only reels to the point that I never open my timeline anymore, the explore page has the things I actually like and I have to search my friends to be able to see their content. Hate it!! Thinking of leaving the app for the first time since joining in 2010.",1
"I have used Instagram for many years. It used to be a great way of sharing photos online and discovering other amazing pics. With time, Instagram became worse with every update. It's not only that it became a pretty bad online shop, cheap copy of TikTok and platform driven by pure greed. It's that the basic functionality is broken. Drafts disappear, the app breaks in the middle of editing or writing... And so much more. It has become unusable. I hope for a new alternative. Instagram is dead.",1
"Everything time I try to change something on my profile the app is not responsive. I'm not sure if there's a bug or something but I just can't get to make it do anything I want. It always allows me to make all the changes but never saves them even when I click to save the changes, when I check, old settings still reflect. even stopped using the app for about 9months and I'm trying again now and it's still doing the same thing. Don't know what to do coz logging off and on again also doesn't help!",1
Too much glitch I am not able to add any person in group neither able to do anything nor the insta is working no reels no nothing very badü•∫I hope u can fix this,1
Gone down the pan. Very very disappointed. Been using it for years for my businesses. And past 1 week it doesn't load feed. Tried it on 2 different networks (home and office). Only time it works is if the network is switched to mobile data. Not practical at all. Tried uninstall and re-install of the app and didn't work.,1
"The last few updates are absolutely terrible. You can't see anything that you want to send to people as it comes up blank, on the same subject as this, I'm not sure as to why you've gotten rid if the feature of being able to see photos or videos that have been shared in groupchats. The quality of video calls are horrible too. I also either don't receive notifications at all, or the complete opposite and receive completely irrelevant things or things from hours ago when I've already responded.",1
"The automatic scrolling on explore page posts is weird an frustrating. It puts landscape posts uncomfortably high on the screen which then causes it to play the audio from the post below if it's a video and makes it difficult to read long captions. Scrolling on the home page and people's profiles is fine, I don't understand why the explore page is different. Also constantly having reels playing in the corner feels like too much. They already have their own page.",1
"I absolutely love Instagram but the app doesn't work properly. It's really glitchy. When I put excellent quality pictures on my story, it ruins the quality and blurs them. When I try to upload to my page, it will say there was a problem uploading the photos/videos and that this has been reported to Instagram and yet the problem never gets fixed. It never lets you edit pictures to fit them in to a frame. Whenever I open the app, sometimes it cuts out and goes off. Please fix this. Thanks.",1
"Videos keep turning 90 degrees counter clockwise, with no apparent way of changing it and no warning it would do this. When i take the videos, its fine. When I review them, it's fine. When i upload them, its fine. When they are finished uploading, they sometimes and randomly rotate 90 degrees. This had lead me to deleting them and losing videos i cant otherwise record. Would not recommend.",1
"I'm unable to create reels??? This app is supposedly becoming a video app, yet the primary video features won't work? The videos won't keep any sound, music or not, drafts are glitchy as hell and that's if it even keeps the draft, templates don't work, saved tracks don't stay saved, photo editing is messed up to name a few... Struggling to find it worth the hassle.",1
"Annoying ""features"". Keeps asking me to follow this and that. Very annoying notifications show up ALL the time. Also when I watch a reel, it jumps up and down to make me swipe up and watch the next reel when I don't want to and there's no way for me to stop it. Also the feed automatically refreshes that I can't find the reel I was just watching anymore. 100% great design üí©",1
"My god! I never had issues with Instagram in years. For a week now, it's become a nightmare. On the main feed, there's no more sound on videos but they are running. I click on the video as usual to enable the sound, and the video just stops. I can't get it to play with sound, I need to drill into that account and watch the video from there. In addition, also from the feed, there's no way to expand the description by clicking on ""more"" anymore. The button is there, but I can't click on it.",1
"Terrible experience. The app crashes regularly, and recently, anytime I try to change my profile picture, I end up with 3/4 of the image cut off, and a massive black area at the bottom. Even though in the preview the image looks correct, but as soon as I hit next you see a huge black area beneath. Garbage.",1
"The app start getting super slow, it doesn't even let me see photos and of course is not the internet, other apps with similar gadgets work perfectly. Also, it's changing everytime not necessarily a whole update, sometimes the way you click on something is now in a different place and so on. It was entertaining, now it's just frustrating, in this condition is not possible to used it :/",1
"Non-stop bugs. App crashes every time I upload a story. Story highlights won't play videos. Half of pictures in highlights don't load. It's impossible to edit highlights, as it won't show the majority of archived content. Dark mode glitches to the point that you can't read anything. I shouldn't have to clear my cache or re-install the app constantly to resolve all of these issues.",1
"Instead of trying to fix all the current bugs they have turned it into a TikTok wannabe. Very disappointed. Still janky to use and creating a reel is one of the most frustrating things to do on the app (which is ironic seeing as they are pushing reels so much). The new layout means the captions on photos are now hidden which is just an inconvenience. Do better Instagram, used to love this app so much but in the past year it's really tanked.",1
"Constant problems, problems that seem to be able to solve quickly, but they are solved for many months, and some are not solved for several years. Updates bring new bugs, subsequent updates old bugs are not corrected. When clicking on vmideo sent to direct, the most random videos are opened. The picture freezes at a random moment in the video that hasn't been resolved in years. Instagram feeds turn off music on the phone, the bug hasn't been solved for at least a couple of years.",1
"I can't stress this enough but give a sorting option for the REELS! I want to see the most popular ones but every time I click on a sound, it shows an unorganized order of the reels. ALSO, allow us to save the reels and put it in any folder we want. Currently, users can save it but aren't allowed to place it on a certain folder. üòï",1
"Hi. I never had an issue with the app until now, I hate the new feed design, please let me go back to the previews one. The description section sometimes covers the image. You can't ""show more"" the description. I don't like in general the new display. Is uncomfortable and I don't like how big the image are now. Hope you take the feedback. Otherwise, I prefer using Twitter.",1
"I cant even open the app anymore. Everytime I open the app, it just shows a black screen now. Tried everything that was recommended to try and fix the issue, still no luck. Instagram is the place that I need to show my works as a mountain bike rider and a photographer/videographer, but now its just really really bad at it. Please just be like how it used to be, simple times with no reels and all that gimmicky stuff. We're all fed up with the crashes, just be the normal Instagram.",1
"It seems to be an issue with most other reviewers as well, but just recently it is continually saying 'couldn't refresh feed'. It has worked fine for years and only starts playing up now for no reason. Following trying to fix this, i am permanently logged out of my account and when i select more help on the login screen, it crashes. Safe to say that the account is now dead and unreachable.",1
"Don't fix something that is not broken. The latest update was a complete disappointment. Photos look like frozen reels and it makes it seem incredibly old and outdated since it turns the once smooth and visually clean scrolling into something mechanical and visually disturbing. You can't stop videos and captions merge into pictures. It's a complete disaster and it really ruined the app, in my opinion.",1
"My app has recently updated to the new trial version and I hate it! I find it so difficult to use, it's really inconvenient to have to tap the caption to make it appear and it's really difficult to read as the text is white and overlaid on the image. I also find it really annoying how scrolling only goes through one post at a time, it makes me much less inclined to spend time on the app.",1
Every time I'm scrolling through the feed the videos freeze after a few seconds and just the audio keep playing. For it to go back to normal I need to click for the video to expand and then I have to re-watch the entire video. It's so annoying and something that's been happening for a long time now. I've tried in different phones and it happens as well. Just solve this.,1
"I don't know what happened but the app is broken now on Android. I can't click on ""more"" anymore, nothing happens, and the app basically doesn't let me scroll properly anymore either. It just jumps from one picture to the next and there's no way to see the actual post anymore except if you click on the account that posted it it brings you to that account's homepage and from there you can have a look at individual posts and they display correctly but that's several steps only to see one post.",1
When i am trying to login it is showing blank screen. Why this is happening..when this issue will resolve..literally frustrated. I tried to uninstall and install still the same is occurring.kindly look into this issue.,1
Can't login without a Phone number. It's gotten shittier. I have my email and Password why does it need a Phone number to send codes. Downfall coming soon,1
Can't see my followers nd following . Buffering when adding ppl in a group chat . Dm buffering . 2nd account feed buffering . And it crashes .,1
"Instagram deleted my account with no reason. edit 1 : with my other profile, now it only shows black screen with loading icon",1
Very low freedom. Making videos are difficult. Hate all the ads.,1
Crashing at start up. And not opening at all. I use a Motorola One Vision.,1
So many glitches yet to be fixed. So irritating because I don't know why I don't get the reply option and reaction and most of the songs showing lyrics are not available.,1
I m facing this problem again that I can't access my account I can't login to my account Instagram has suspended my account I don't know what to do with this this is the second time I m facing this issue I don't know the problem what is going on but this is not Good Very disappointed with this type of service Instagram has given to us,1
My business account was hacked 8 months ago and nobody responded to all my requests. Meta Support was useless. Instagram Support doesn't exist,1
What happen to this app I don't know the is excess of glitches which I am facing from last 2 days and still not fixed after unstallimg and then install it again I don't know what happen but this need to be fixed,1
Video posting or even reel posting has been buggy left and right. Reels itself have audio doubling at the first post and even then none of these bugs and glitches have been fixed.,1
"What is wrong with this app , seriously im not even able to creat new account, even if im putting correct phone no and email its showing invalid email, and why the hell that no. is in US form by adding +1 , maybee because of that my phone no is showing invalid , please solve this bug as soon as possible.",1
"Unstable App, makes you lose content because it glitches and deletes or prevents from editing photos altogether",1
"Every time I enter the application I am faced with a black screen, I tried several times to delete it and download it again I locked my phone and did many things but it is still like this since 29 jul I hope to solve the problem as soon as possible",1
Getting worst after every update! Refreshing takes more then a minute on on chats and 2-3 minutes in homepage.,1
"Messages on IG in not updating, despite me updating the app all the time. I can only heart react to the messages and it does not give me the same features that I have on messenger. I've contacted them multiple times for the past few montha and there was no response.",1
"I uninstalled this app to free up some space on my phone and when I tried to install it again, the background was just white. I tried using everything but it doesn't show anything. It just shows a white background.",1
"It shows more sponsored or suggested content than anything else. Please stop it. That's annoying. EDIT: on top, stories keep turning black. Seriously? How can a major feature be bugged for so long?",1
While uploading a post it takes a lot of time but it did not uploaded it is a main issue to me pls try to rectify it,1
"Becoming useless insta msgs are totally glitchy some time the display of story frezzes, sometimes the story don't get deleted after deleting , useless",1
It's app is good but I have issue on intragram messenger swipe reply is not working so make it possible as soon as possible,1
"After what seems like forever, the Android version still lacks basic messaging features that ruin replies in chats if you don't have them. Also, posts disappearing downward upon launch is frustrating. To top it off, suggested posts that I can't turn off? Why are you doing this? Why do you not care what customers are saying?",1
It keeps crashing everytime I press a button and try to access DMs. Literally unusable right now. And can't send a report because it crashes when i try to. On redmi note 10 pro,1
"I got hacked and can't get back into my account, the help centre isn't helpful at all you give round and round in circles!!. That bad I've had no choice but to open another fresh account. Meta you need to seriously pull your finger out and improve what use to be a great app",1
"After this recent update videos turned to reels is really disappointing üëé,my videos can't be seen by everyone getting less views please fix this issue the old one was better with videos and reels had separate options",1
Haven't been able to upload photos for a while Report message comes up to confirm it has informed Instagram but issue still not resolved?! Same issues when trying to upload multiple photos. When thus be updated?,1
Cannot login to existing account even after using correct username & password. What a mess.,1
Dear I want to hide my follow list from my friends also so that no one can see my friend list. This is the main feature i want in Instagram please,1
I think instagram has started to lag a lot in every 5 mins it has to lag this is really disappointing.,1
"Does the ""Not interested"" button actually works? Maybe up your machine learning game please. Scrolling through reels are just hours of picking which reason to choose hoping one would stop your app to show me posts i already disliked five times prior. You know what will help your algorithm more? Add option to block hashtags so we don't see anymore unwanted content.",1
"Every time the app has an update afterward I go to use the app and it doesn't work. It's pretty annoying I love Instagram I have used it for many years but, here lately it's just not as good. I want to keep using the app but, why when it never works for me.",1
Just a white screen. Reinstalled app and reset permissions. Hard reset phone and still just a blank white screen. This has been for 2 days and still no joy. 10 days later 26/07 still not fixed.,1
Story and post are loading since yesterday. Still not posted,1
"Idk why but recently, I can't make stories that are videos. I guess it has something to do with my phone? Or maybe it's the app? I think about 2 weeks ago, I could still make video stories, and then after that, it wasn't working anymore. It was loading ALL THE TIME. I tried deleting and downloading the app again, but it's still not working. Pictures worked but videos don't.",1
"Instagram doesn't do anything about scam bots or people posting messed up contant even after getting alot of reports on it. People with 1M followers verified accounts posting NSFW, Dangerous stuff and animals abuse. Instagram please do something, if not than just delete this app.",1
"It stopped working completely. Can't even open it up...I just get a white screen and it never loads. I've deleted, reinstalled, reset my phone and still nothing.",1
"So, when I try to make a post, my ""gallery"" doesn't show all of my photos. While I can leave instagram to access my actual photos, they are no longer available in the app. Can't post more than one photo since my phone updated either.",1
"This is heights.. I am reporting to the team for last 6 months about the issue that I am not able to collaborate, i dont see the collaboration option but no steps have been taken, this is so unprofessional. Extremely disappointed with Instagram.",1
"The schedule post options. Available on iOS is not available on Android, kindly work on that Thanks",1
The app shows ads a lot 1/4 seeing ad 3 feeds 1 ad 3 feeds 1 ad Sham on you,1
"What once was good has now become a lag infested ad platform. I use it to keep in touch with friends and other creative contacts, not see an ad every second post! Uninstalling this app cleared up slowdowns on the my phone. Would highly recommend this to a masochist. Pity I can't give a zero start review, one is generous.",1
i cant login to my account. for some reason it suspended my account although i did absolutely nothing? and then it forced me to log out and when i tried logging back in it says the username doesn't exist?? what ?? fix this please.,1

There is lots of problems in Instagram and the are not fixed it .... Very bad experience.....and customer service very bad,1
"The app only show blank screen. Horrible experience. For the CS agents that deal with reviews, please escalate this issue to the engineering team and make this a priority for your next sprint. Many users are complaining about the same issue and it is damaging your reputation.",1
"There is another buggy mess introduced into the instgram which comes in the form of ""stories"" because all the successive stories mention by another person so I'm unable to remention the story again it's shows ( couldn't upload.try again later) requesting to change the system...",1
"This app became rubbish. Not all edit makes it to final result, wayyyyyyyyy too many bugs.",1
"I don't know how it's possible for the app to get even more broken thank it was when I didn't have allow the app to update at all. It sucks so bad, and I can't just uninstall the update. No, I have to uninstall and reinstall. Please fix this app. Meta sucks.",1

Instagram disabled my Barb account for no reason at all. Till this day I haven't gotten it back and I haven't gotten any feedback from the appeals as well. I have worked for over 3 years to get that account where it is today and now it's just gone. I honestly had a bad experience with IG,1

At this point I just don't know what's happening here. Every time I tried to enter Instagram it literally just kicks me out the app. It glitches too much and sometimes something would be wrong with the algorithm. Please try to fix this app.,1

Comment box is not visible when we type something. Makes it very hard to review written content.,1
Its not working well When I uploaded story on Instagram then it shows only 7 sec not as much Whats the qrong with this app I want to Upload minimum 15 Sec story,1
They removed reels notification settings. You will get spammed with notifications on people you don't care about posting their reels everyday just so they can advertise the feature. Now I have disabled all notifications because this is a huge F you to the user. Will probably uninstall eventually and just use a browser.,1
@instagram my chat got deleted in Instagram and I have downloaded my account data but it haven't recovered my messages. Those were very very important to me. Please help me out it is really important.,1
I don't like that they changed to algorithms to favor videos. I prefer the silence and beauty of photography. All those videos overwhelm my ears and eyes with noise and nonsense,1
"Everytime I opened up the app. It just a blank black screen. I checked the connection, restarted my phone and stuff. It still doesnt work.",1
My Instagram app messaging swipe reply are not available and many time I will send report and query but problem not solve at a time.,1

By my account I am unable to post reel or videos and two of my videos are being stuck which I can't even save in drafts,1
Insta has basically taken control of my timeline and shows me nothing I want to see. I used to love it but it's obvious they're on a course to try and compete with tiktok so pictures will almost be dead.,1
Every single account and Ad I've blocked shows up on my feed anyway. What's the point of giving users the option? There should be a literal age limit block to get rid of content users don't wish to see. I'm not interested in content by teens + 20yr olds or Tiktok. If blocking options work on other sites what's going on with Instagram?,1
"My Instagram screen has been white for over a month now, I've tried all possible ways to fix it, uninstalling etc. I've been using insta lite, my account works fine, thus it's some problem with the app or the update, idk. Please help me fix it insta. My insta life is a wreck",1
"App is not working. I've restarted app, restarted phone, Uninstalled. Not working.",1
"Pushing more and more content that i didn't sign up for Not showing what i want to see as older post of my following list instead forcing me to see what instagram wants me to see. Getting annoyed and stopped using this application. This is not Society media this is now ""advertisement"" media. Disappointed...",1
Disappointing. The app doesn't load anything anymore. It's stuck on the same 3 posts from days ago and will not load anything new. The direct messaging function has completely stop working.,1

stop forcing reels on us i am so serious. you are not tiktok you never will be and y'all are ruining it so bad trying to cosplay as them. posting REGULAR videos was one of the best parts of the app and getting rid of the option to even crop videos is ridiculous. take the tiktok wig off and return to y'all's roots i am begging.,1
I am facing problem to open my saved audio. I tried to write many reports but didn't work at all,1
"The app doesn't even work anymore,I can't refresh my feed'my home page or even my messages ,litterly nothing on the app works I have the newest update,and my phone's new so I've never had any problem with another app,this is kinda bulls***.very disappointed gonna delete this app if not working soon",1
PLEASE do something about the sex bots who keep liking everyones stories. Could train a chimp to do a better job.,1
"Suddenly I cannot open my gallery through this app. If I want to make a post, I have to leave Instagram, go to my gallery, make a post, then go back to Instagram to see if the photos posted. This must be fixed now.",1
"Keeps crashing, when you want to upload a few pictures together you can't adjust them (zoom in or out or even the positioning) anymore which leads to using the app less",1
Latest update has introduced a fun new feature in which I can't access any of the photos on my phone. Bit of a problem for a photo sharing all.,1
"Never loads have to disconnect and reconnect to wifi multiple times before it loads and sometimes that doesn't work really annoying, I literally never use this app anymore because it's so frustrating",1
"Almost unusable. Ever since Facebook acquired it, the user experience has been abysmal. Never before has it been so obvious that the user is the product. Their algorithm for determining if your account has been hacked or not is broken.",1
"Was watching a video of a puppy via my Facebook page on my regular android tablet. Suddenly my account was blocked for suspicious activity? They thought I was a hacker?? I've tried all day to validate my account to prove I am who I am. The app rejects its own validation codes, will only email the same code. Has rejected change of password. Impossible to access. Have read help pages, no solutions, no where to report log in issue to. App now unusable. Its a shame, I really like it when it worked.",1
"So my account is accused with phishing and requires me to verify in order to log in. It states that I'll need to type in the code they sent me to my gmail account, but ive tried refreshing countless time and there is no code sent to my email. Im really frustrated and I hope that this will be fixed soon",1

This apps works differently in different mobiles.

I've been using Instagram before the whole reels thing to share my art and grow a following but the algorithm began pushing reels instead of normal posts. It's having a tiktok related identity crisis and I worry about the future of the platform because of that.,1
"Riddled with ads, bugs and bots. The auto cropping is terrible. This new update is terrible. What was wrong with the old layout? Why this new terrible layout? Everyday this update gets worse.

Locked me out for literally no reason I don't post anything I just scroll through my feed.

Network is not working in it on other apps my network is good and excellent nit on instagram it is worst I think it's Instagram problem.,1
After installation it has been a month and the app started lagging ( keep closing and not working). My phone is Samsung S21 Ultra which means there is no way that it may be because of my phone. Optimize the app for the Samsung not only for Apple,1

"Hate the update. New timeline is awful - no gaps between posts, and hard to read captions. Sound is autoplaying now, and will reset each time I close the app. Trying to take a photo through Stories makes it turn grainy and over-saturated.

I see more ads than posts from my friends.",1

When you record an insta story video that is longer than the length of one story, the first one part is the ONLY one that comes with good sound.

"Instagram was never a perfect platform but ever since the facebook takeover its gotten so much worse to the point that it's nearly unbearable. Useless changes, tons of bugs and a bunch of worthless features (one being story music which has a terrible selection). I still use the app as a form of communication but other than that I've practically abandoned the platform all together as it's just a pain. Just fix your damn app.",1
I have not messaged anyone from my account in any way.in any wrong way.pleasse solve this problem of mine and activate my account to unify the message/,1
"Had to uninstall it as each time I open the app, it tells me that it 'has trouble installing English (UK)' and recommends US instead. When I do so, it doesn't load content properly, and can't refresh feed. Toggling airport mode/restarting phone works temporarily until it does it again. Can't be bothered with it anymore. It's competing with Spotify desktop for worst UX/app functionality ever.",1
"I recently uninstalled and reinstalled the app and now I can't seem to reply to the messages individually. The feature was there prior to uninstalling but now no matter how much I try, it's not there. The stories tend to keep showing up as unseen even if seen. The theme changes to white for no reason. The messages do not show up unless I refresh a hundred times. Seriously, it's a pain.",1
In this application you can't even use more than 15seconds of audio for a reel based on pic. I don't know how this app is even surviving the market because of playstore.playstore is the worst market ever. Google itself is the worst. Google you better start accepting applications from locals instead of this.,1
"Invades privacy. Was looking to buy something on a web browser and low and behold ads start popping up in IG from the website it was on. This app is just full of cringy posts, and no matter how many I say I'm not interested in, they keep showing up.",1
"The app on Google Pixel 3 is terrible compared to the app for Apple. The android app does not save drafts ever and I've had this issue for a month now. if you leave and come back to the app a few minutes later, your saved drafts are gone. you also can't edit font size in your stories when you type text. ie) if you wanted the font smaller to fit your text onto one line instead of split into 2 lines.",1
Reels are not what Instagram was about ! New feature of adding a note doesn't make sense . Why are you Messing up the app in the name of innovative features. Kindly get back to the old module. Instagram is no more an interesting place !,1
It's a very bad experience with Instagram my account was not showing massage... Team Instagram please fix bugs,1
Too much ads...its irritating me..after every story 2 ads..... How much money will make form doing this... just asking....,1
"The latest update is a disaster. Any post, story, or even message takes ages to load, if load at all. I have trouble logging into my account - again, it takes ages and may not even work. Notifications function well, but they don't open the app when tapped at. I'm sure the problem is with the app, not with my phone, as I have factory reset it, with no changes whatsoever. Would highly appreciate a fix or a rework",1
IDK what the glitch is the app keeps on closing as soon as I on it...plz fix that...it's frustrating me a lot....and I can't react to any of my messages I can only like it there is no option displaying on my screen...fix that asap...,1
"Nope. IG blue arrow on the right side for posting is still not working after I have uninstalled the apps and reinstalled. By the way, when I try to remix a dance video reel, it turns out funny. At preview, everything is fine. After it is posted, my video is ALWAYS faster than music and even EARLIER then the original reel. I retried almost 50 times on different days using both Wifi and 4G coz I thought the fault was my network, but now I don't think so.",1
It distorts the sound of my HQ live music videos when uploaded to reels. I have hundreds of posts that I am holding back because I do not want to loose the audio quality.,1
New update is ridiculous. Horrible layout that's impossible to navigate and when you try to send a post to someone all the recommended accounts are usually people I don't send anything to ever. It doesn't correct itself based on who I send posts to most. Why does a social media app based on the notion of sharing photos and videos need a shopping window??? You are trying so hard for something no one wanted.,1
"Can please someone explain what has happened with sending posts?? I'd like to forward a pic or video and my most forwarded to friends are missing from the list of profiles. I can't even find them through the search option. Its extremely frustrating and irritating. If the goal with this update was for people to stop using IG, good job and well done. That's exactly happening!!!",1
"this app just keeps getting worse man. I've been on here for the past 4 years or so and I'm frustrated with it at this point. the reels algorithm keeps suggesting me only regional content, and would not let me go back to the type of content I was viewing earlier. There isn't even an option to filter out the type of content I wouldn't like to view on reels.",1
"what is up with this new update? why can't I save the pictures or videos that are being sent using the ""keep in chat"" form? it was all good like few days, i could save the videos which were sent using the ""keep in chat"" feature, but suddenly i can't? like, i constantly keep on holding the picture or video and try to save them, but it's not working. please fix this issue asap. Thank you!",1
The app has been lagging a lot in the past year. My msgs disappear or glitch. I can't see people's stories or post half the time. Now I can't even click on the app.,1
"Fotos autozoom in when uploading for a post its annoying, Is it just me or do you guys can't also edit reels posted with creator studio? i cant remove the from the feed grid neither change the thumbnail",1
"Worest experience, even I am logging in with correct username, it's showing the username doesn't exist.",1
"I really HATE what instagram has become!! Its an absolute joke that because I use an app to share models photos I have had to change my password literally over 30+ times. You constantly flag my accout for the dumbest BS and then wait days to say ""Oops your account was accidentally deactivated, sorry"". You deleted my last page that I had for years and had Thousands of followers, then poof you delete my account with No notification as to why. Instagram has become nothing less than a nightmare!!",1
"I can't log in to my other accounts it keep on saying that my username doesn't belong to any account that sucks I can still search those accounts, your app is not working well",1
I didn't get react option it just a like only and not any theme or note of any account is showing . I'm requesting to please fix as soon as possible,1
"After the new updation of Instagram Login page ...... Can't login even by having fast internet connection, Correct Username as well as the password ..... Tried many a times üò©üò©",1
"It keeps stopping me from doing genuine stuff which I do on Instagram, does not let me comment and restricts my activity when not fault .. it's too robotic there's no amendments ever since being made .. anybody tags anybody and the option left is only to block them on public and private profile even though they not on my friend list .. very annoying",1
Could you please add in settings a new function to completely stop suggesting reels & stories in certain languages?,1
Account got hacked and not able to get it back. And now the app keeps crashing,1
"app keeps closing and doesnt load things properly. constant glitches involving general app format and messages. cant even open the app on my phone anymore, it shuts down the second i do.",1
"It isnt working , showing a blank screen whenever I open the app on my device. This has been happening since a month. It's so frustrating. Please fix this as soon as possible",1
"Come on!! Why can't we send links in DM!!?? Some say that it's an EU regularization, but I am living in Toronto. Why can't I send a simple link to my friend? This is the case for most of the websites.",1
Terribly glitchy. I feel like the android version gets neglected it's so much worse than apple. Please fix this. Biggest frustration is the toggle to share to Facebook sometimes just simply doesn't work.... Unacceptable.,1
Shameless Zuckerberg is more obsessed with ads than his wife. He shouts reels reels reels reels reels reels while doing it and not the name. This is an absurd app waiting to ruin your life. If you haven't installed this app don't do it. Don't waste your life. Now they put ad on before any post. Everything wrong with the world is because of Zuckerberg and his unsuccessful app of facebook,1
"It has so many bugs and errors, it became u s e l e s s. At this point just delete app completely",1
I havr a problem. My instagram mesenger is not working. And messages are not swipe. Please cheqe my device.,1
"It's very annoying, I just downloaded it,I tried to open the app, but what I can see it white blank, nothing is showing, it's can't even take me to where I can login to my account, it's only white blank, so I do not know what exactly is happening to it, please you guys should work on it, thank you .",1
The app is becoming borderline unusable. I have to force restart it several times a day just to use the messaging function as my send and reaction options frequently disappear. Perhaps some of the effort being put into the ~metaverse~ could go to actually maintaining your existing platforms. Edit: six months later and I am still dealing with the same constant glitching of the app. It seems to be worsening. The new feed and emphasis on reels is awful. I enjoyed Instagram for sharing photos.,1
"Horrible. For some reason, Instagram has deleted 5 of my accounts now, 1222/22... Reason was that I am impersonating myself. Yet, people can be racists and report you for no reaspn, and nothing happens to them. Shows what is supported by Instagram. Instagram supports Hate and racism. They have damaged relationships and business. Sincerely - Supermattatatt.",1
"This Instagram app is becoming so annoying...I can get to open my app..it's not working, it keeps shutting down...I have updated and I have also uninstalled and reinstalled yet it's not work...come fix the problem",1
Dark theme is not applying correctly on poco x2 for months. Optimization of this app sucks alot.,1
"Very poor, the app works fine but they are trying to be tiktok, pics are downgraded. I'm now getting more likes on twitter and vero. With a fraction of the followers, Instagram is worthless really.",1
I was still unable to update my messenger. There is no option in the settings to update messenger. Please fix this bug.,1
"Although the app offers a lot it doesn't offer any sufficient customer support service. I've been trying to connect my business' Instagram page with the Facebook page for a week now just because I want to post on both platforms all together, but I can't. Sending feedback has been useless and there's nowhere to send a complaint to. Absolutely horrific experience with this app. Definitely do not recommend for any businesses wanting to develop themselves on Instagram.",1
Developers are not putting more effort in the app which is a shame when billion of people use it. I receive messages after 3-4 days and can't really stay connected with people anymore on IG. I am using snap and whatsapp because doesn't seem to be fixed this issue and a lot of others.,1
"Over the recent months to a few years this app has just gotten worse. As others have described it's just turned into one big advertising platform. They actually replaced the notification page button with a market button. I remember a time when you used to be able to share a post and you'd get solid engagement but even that has gone now because of the utterly stupid new algorithm. Instagram is a far cry from what it once was and in a bad, bad way. Literally no one asked for any of these changes.",1
"OK seriously what is the wrong with you!!!!!!!!!!! This new update is totally unusual! . and you know what l'm so angry because some of story features disappeare out of the blue like adding filter to my video/photo after taking them this feature keeps appears and disappears randomly , this is totally unprofessional . And by the way, we are in 2021 and IG still not having an option for deleting a specific photo from a photo album.",1
"It's getting ridiculous. Videos not uploading and the feed gets full of unrelated content, constantly. If I was interested in influencers selling me weight loss programs or make up, then I'd follow them. Being a 45 male, these things don't really appeal to me.",1
i cant log in instagram with my phone sayign my account doesnt exist but i checked my ipad and my account clearly does exist and i have access to it... ive deleted and redownloaded it so many times alreayd and i still cant get in pls fix this hnghhhhh,1

"never works. crashes, bugs, can't change my profile picture some days and constant ads. this app has run wild and is the most trash out of all the social media platforms",1
I can't add my location to Instagram even though I have my all phone settings regarding locations are right... Instagram is getting tooo bad,1
"Bug in followers filter, date followed: latest and earliest. No changes.",1
"App made for content sharing and has too many limits for posting stuff. Why can't I post landscape and portrait at the same time without cropping one or the other? Isn't Instagram supposed to be the same as facebook, where I can post a thousand pictures without limits?",1
-Its useless because its rulses are not so good -Infect our msjing are blocked to sent -one pic on our chat which pic was sended by our friend -You have to fix my error because of my privacy! -Its useless to carry our privaccy,1

"Blank screen every time i wanna log in to existing account. Then i clear data, cache, and reinstall this app. After the install is done and nothing happen. I cant access Instagram at all. Please fix this for android user. Thx",1
Negative....constantly hacked. Always have problems and the platform is clearly unsafe. Get your children off this dangerous App,1
I'm really tired of getting bugs Still now my account doesn't have notes options I tried every possible ways but it doesn't make sense,1
Too many message drops. Sometimes the messages are not sent and doesn't appear in the sent state either. Didnt expect this level of quality from Meta,1
"Dear Instagram! Why are you showing me post of that peoples whom I am not following. I don't want to follow them and don't want to see their post on my home page. I left Facebook just because of this reason and you are doing same thing now at Instagram. When you are giving saperate page for seeing post and reels of another people, then why this type of post on my home page. Stop this. It is very irritating.",1
I'm having trouble opening Instagram why what is going on on my old phone it works on my new phone it doesn't work can anyone someone tell me why?,1
"What is going on??? Why are things I see popping up on other ppl feeds? I DO NOT WANT THEM TO SEE WHAT I SEE UNLESS I CHOOSE TO SHARE! IM NOT A COOKIE CUTTER, I VALUE MY INDIVIDUALUTY! META has trashed a once great app for individuals. SHAME on META Used to be better but the targeting ads are horrendous. Example - shop a baby gift for a friend & you're slammed with everything baby, prenatal & pregnancy related. NO ITS ONE TIME GIFT, I'm not breeding!",1
"It won't let me do anything. Think I've been shadowbanned. I've cant log in no matter what I do. I've used another phone to create an account it worked fine. But this one won't let me create an account, log in, get help or anything. It's become totally freaking useless.",1
Not showing chats in inbox and can't share anyone reels and can't recieve anyones reel So many bugs,1

"There are so many bugs in Instagram, the song I used for my story is now unavailable then why I don't understand you people put the songs there if they will be unavailable after sometime. Please fix this problem #instagram",1
Its too bad...it shows nothing except the black screen...i have reinstalled it many of the time but it keeps showing me the bkack screen...its one month now ..and still the problem is not solved ..i am really frustrated due to its poor quality,1
Latest update is buggy. Still buggy. Been reinstalling this app every few weeks. The stories is still acting up. Not sure if they're having trouble with the zflip interface,1
I signed out and wanted to sign back in and it became a white screen. Now I can't even get into the Instagram app without it showing a white screen. I even deleted and download it many times and this is my third day trying and still nothing.,1
I am not able to get reactions on double tapping the messages also I am unable to use all features the catch is i can use them on my another account ü§£,1
Instagram keeps quitting automatically and not allowing to open again. Exepriencing this issue for a very long time. This is happening again.,1

"Ruined the app! In trying to be like TikTok and updating, they've completely ruined it! I can't scroll old posts from friends and the frequency of ads is just ridiculous. After using for years, I'm taking a break from IG. So sad to see such a downhill mess.",1

"Hi, I really like thish aap. But after the resent update, it is turning out to be a disaster. All my videos and reels can be seen only in the reels section, also some of my reels are disappeared.

"I just checked my feed. 14 new posts by accounts I actually follow, but there were 10 ads and suggested posts mixed in. This has gotten ridiculous. Why do y'all think people want to see the suggested posts before the posts by accounts we actually follow? Show them at the end only.",1
this app used to be my favorite but what the hell is wrong with this app these days it won't me sign in if i log out saying that my username is wrong even tho its is right it won't let me do any reels if i want to use an audio to do a reel it will just go blank for a few seconds and go back to original video instead of letting me do it i hope you fix this problem soon,1
"After the update ,the app is glitching and none of the reels, posts or stories load.I am not even able to see texts nor type anything.Facing a lot of issues with the app recently",1
"Very few things in life are more irritating than trying to interact with reels on your feed. Enabling/disabling audio or even liking the reel is like target practice while playing Flash, so it doesn't open in full screen. Liking a reel freezes the video, so you have to scroll until it's off your screen, and then scroll back to continue watching the video. Can't view captions sometimes in full screen. Honestly, 90% of the time when I'm interacting with reels, I can't help thinking fu ig. Sorry.",1
"I use to like Instagram despite the many annoying flaws and limitations but yesterday out of the blue I've been suspended for no apparent reason. I've been using Instagram for nearly two years with no issues, posting native Australian flora, now I don't even know why I'm suspended. So frustrating as there's no way of finding out why or even the chance to lodge a complaint or get a review. There's no customer support whatsoever. If I could give a zero star I would.",1

Instagram just deleted my account without my permission. I disabled my account 15 days ago and now it is automatically deleted. I tried recovering my account on the help center but it is declining because it claims my username does not exist. I hate the fact that I had so much data and info in my account but instagram just decided to become unnecessary. I'm sad,1

They removed my previous account and it is impossible to contact Support, they do not respond, even after 2 months.",1
The filter is really nice and the app is fine but the reason why I give this app three star it's because it crashes everytime I use it and the first time I used this the filter is free to use without WiFi but after a few months it will crash.,1
"It looks like they don't really take care of the changes you do to your account i change my email like 1 or 2 years ago and they still want to send confirmation codes to my old one of which i don't have access congrats dogs. Hope you get cancelled as soon as possible. Have a great day, dogs.",1

My story archive is gone...just not loading...all the stories from 4 years just gone...what a shitshow of an App... don't bother with this,1
almost impressive what a horrible experience they've designed who in their right mind would enjoy a service that shows you twice the amount of ads to your friends posts,1
So many lame reasons to not boost reels. Everytime a new reason why I can't boost my reels! Shame.,1
I'm facing problems by the new loop. And there are many bugs. Plz help I can't get login to my insta account.,1
The app when when I first re-downloaded the app it wouldn't open and so I tried everything nothing worked it's so buggy,1
"What do you expect from 'meta'? Abusive permission requirements, of course! Video chat only legitimately needs microphone and camera permissions.. and that's plenty for every legitimate video chat app, but not IG! They won't let you until you give them control over your phone! Invasive! I added a new contact to my phone, the next thing i know they are in my activity list ""Your contact, so n so, is on Instagram as so n so."". I have never allowed insta or fb access to my contacts. No permission!",1
Remember back before the latest update when Instagram posts actually had captions on them? Me too. What a ridiculous clown show.,1
I can't log into my account at all not even with the codes the app send me you can't email or call anyone in the instagram app totally useless,1
"Can u adjust the online indicator because last active in private message is delay in 6 minutes,i wish this could be good for the development of this apps.",1
"Wth is wrong with IG??? I'm totally sick of keep being logged out for no reasons for too many times. Since the recent updated, when I logged in, I'm frequently logged out! Idk how many times I logged in for just few minutes. Please fix the bugs ASAP.",1
Very disagreeable app. It doesn't solve any problem on reporting it also i don't like this app as it doesn't solve my problem,1
Stupid!! Third thing I posted I got put on a week ban and It didn't specifically say why or what it was. My best guest was that it was because I posted something that I originally posted on Snapchat which if so what's the big deal? This app isn't just trash it's the whole dang dumpster!!,1
One problem in this app is that what should be added a song option is deleted so please remake this option then this app is awesome,1
If I try post photos it will only show photos in the Instagram folder. What's the point of that? I can't upload a set of photos only single ones with other. Totally unusable.,1
Instagram support system is very bad No network connection show always in monetization help And bonuses not showing in my account i am mail this problem more time but Instagram team did not respond me,1
"Hello instagram Team, I was not able to upload the reel on Instagram for two months and I deleted it for a few days, I thought now this problem must have been fixed. But today it is not getting downloaded. my waiting is wasted. Please solve this problem. Thank You",1
I think there is a bug in this version. Mostly users are unable to login into their accounts. It's been weeks this issue arrived and still not any progress,1
I updated the app today. The app is crashing immediately after opening. Had no problem before that. Kindly fix the bug and give an update. Waiting for your immediate response regarding this issue.,1
Acounts I dont know keep tagging me in pictures and stories for some advertisements. That is really annoying... to that comes the fact that I can't unfollow hashtags,1
"Allow users to turn off ""Suggested Posts."" This is a very unhelpful feature that is annoying at best. So many bugs with posting videos in slo-mo on a Galaxy S8.",1
App exiting when trying to play audio message.,1
"Due to some issue, I uninstalled the Instagram app and installed again. However, this time I'm just getting a black screen and it's not working any further. As a preliminary, I cleaned cache and temp files as well. Tried restart and shutdown of phone. Uninstalled and installed the app several times but no luck. Can you please check this issue and advise?",1
I could not react..... It's been 1year but still the option is not showing.... not at all satisfied Not able to open the app.... It's been 1week I'm not able to open the app I'm using Instagram scene 1year but I can't get the option of reacting on the videos or chat So many bugs... Should rectify it soon..... Waste of time,1

It's getting worse by copying other applications like tiktok. It was nice as it used to be the update are just useless,1
Even after i updated Instagram why is the sticker option isnt available for me? I cant use stickers...Im not even getting that sticker icon beside the writing panel...Insta used to be good but nowadays it glitches alot and my screen goes black.,1
"Doesn't abide by their guidelines , VERY MUCH PARTIAL IN INDIA in regarding shutting sikh voices . Also buggy app ( needs good internet to work )",1
Im not having the reply on messege feature.. and i have been reporting from 2 weeks and no update. What is the solution ??,1

"Never worked without a problem. Always having to find ways how to fix them. Now, the connection between Facebook.",1
Very bad experience ever. Why reel music is not available for me? It's been almost 1 month but still issues doesnt fixed yet.,1
"Most buggy app ever along with Facebook. It seems that they don't listen to our feedbacks. 0 stars, you're welcome.",1
Recent bugs have ruined the app as I'm unavailable to get notifications on anything at all despite all settings both on the app & my phone as well,1
It was my understanding that the purpose of this app was to share pictures and get to see your friends' pictures. I am not interested in a shopping app.,1
Crashes constantly Galaxy S9+. Won't stay open for more than 5 seconds after most recent update.,1
"This new update suuucks. Please put the notifications and add photo back on the main tool bar at the bottom of the screen. I don't care about reels or ads or shopping. This new layout it horrible and not user friendly. Editing has gone downhill. Overall garbage. Instagram was about posting photos or videos, so stop trying to turn it into tiktok or a shopping site. I wish there was a 0 star option.",1
Videos not clear like iOS. I don't know why when i upload or record and share it on Instagram via Android. Video clips aren't not clear like sharing on Instagram via iOS. :(,1
Always have a bug from messaging... It is always delay,1
"Why is Instagram suddenly trying to be tiktok. Put it back to how it was! I want to see pictures and of the people I follow, not random videos!!",1
Since 15days it's not working very bad. Try to fix as soon as possible,1
Dear instagram team my instagram has stopped sending messages for 3 days without any reason please fix it,1
"Engagement dropped off a cliff, went from 20k to less than 1k in a few months , just pathetic, that alien head in charge needs to give Instagram back to us photographers, and not trying to make it a fake tiktok",1
This new version is not good story can't be saved to gallery no option saveüôÑüò£üòëüò§,1
"i got Instagram to keep up with my friends photos. I don't have tik tok, i dont want tik tok. change it back to friends pictures and stories + ads interspersed",1
"Even though I have a professional account I'm still not able to invite collaborations, have submitted multiple bug reports about this glitch but still it's not solved. Also I'm not able to access my stories archive (saving stories to archives setting is turned on). Please solve this glitch Instagram team.",1
"It's getting worst day by day. I have facing some issues since long. Can't upload any picture story, it even can't show picture after uploading.",1
It randomly logged me out of my account and now I can't log back in since I changed my USERNAME now I need a whole nother app (facebook) just to get into an a account I was randomly logged out of for NO REASON!,1
Can't open reels and not also Can't watch stories instagram is fully bug,1
"Too much bug. Unable to even open it. Like whenever opening this app, in second it stops working...",1
After update the video download option is not showing,1
"They just deleted my account, saying it was against the policy because it was private and people can't see it freely, now i have to rebuilt it again",1
"I go away for 2 weeks and you ram my feed with a sponsored ad or suggested accounts every other post. Where are the people I follow? My favourites? What the hell are you doing to us? We hate reels! We HATE THEM! THIS IS NOT TIKTOK! I joined for community not sales and promotions. I am one of many, enjoy the shitshow you're creating. It's not loved anymore.",1
"I have been using instagram for last 4 years. I really like using it. But after recent updates, I am really disappointed with the functioning of this app. I tried re-installing the app again and again but still the problem is same "" couldn't refresh feed, black screen, buffering "". I didn't even see my draft reels or posts. It's really frustrating now. I raised my concern to the team but the issue hasn't been resolved yet. Please fix this problem as soon as possible.",1
"The app isn't opening. On installation it just opens to a black screen, not loading anything. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app only to have the same results. This has been happening for 2 days now. The website is working but the app isn't making it very inconvenient to use.",1
Am changing my rate to one star because my account was desabled First they asked me to provide my personal information to confirm that I am not a bot so i did A message showed up saying that I can get back to my account in approximately 24 hours next day the same message and the next until after one month my account was desabled saying i didn't provide my info and left it for more than 30 days I tried to use Instagram forms to get it back but it says that I must provide my personal infos firstüòë,1
"INSTAGRAM SOLD OUT!! Tbh I thought I was crazy cause I couldn't see any, ANY OF MY FRIENDS PHOTOS ANYMORE its just alot of accounts I don't know amd just pushing add of business i don't wanna see or follow.

Insta is not functionaling properly it is being stock and getting a gloves my messages are not available to say even though my reels are getting Stuck and I can't use it properly please I request you to solve the problem in the issue of my instagram,1
"Something is very wrong with the new update for instagram. captions dont show up properly. It seems like theyre not bound to the edges of the screen. Half of the caption kinda of just ""hangs over"" the edge of the screen, making it such that you cant read the entire thing. On insta story, the same issue happens too when I try to overlay texts over my stories. please fix! (using google pixel 2 xl)",1
i can't get in to my Instagram sent u message on email service no body answer all meta company is bad not only Instagram,1
"There are so many bugs in this app, like( not reply of a specific message). I think they should be fix it, otherwise it is awesome.",1
"Whenever I try to pick photos to post, I can't view the small thumbnails and just showing grey boxes. I have to pick the boxes individually to see what pictures they actually are. This makes posting incredibly inconvenient. This also applies when picking a profile pic bc you can't see which photo you want. Been like this on multiple updates now.",1
"On android, pictures do not send unless i close and open the app again. on iPhone, 1 out of 3 photos are sent without the captions...... This app's communication features keep getting new additions without fixes addressing existing concerns. You are accumulating a lot of technical debt. I'm going to look at alternative apps if this can't be fixed, because it is making my Instagram experience unenjoyable, although I used to love it.",1
"literally just a black screen whenever i open it. undownloaded it and downloaded it again, same result. force stop, same result.",1
"Someone hacked my account and change my phone number, email and password. I have reported this to ig several times and no response. I cannot speak to a live person. I would like to get my old account back. I also sent you a video.",1
Literally cannot open the app anymore as it crashes everytime i open it I've restarted my phone and reinstalled the app and nothing has happened.,1
The new update! I don't like it I can't like any emoji and reply in the chat?!,1

"This app used to be great before but suddenly when I uninstalled it and installed it again it just been so bad!

"Is was a great app for such a long time. I use (or rather used to) is for my business and connecting with other creatives from my field of expertise. But it doesn't work anymore. Everything is either frozen or invisible. Posting anything is impossible... and before, my dear Instagram crew, you'll say things like ""Try cleaning cache or reinstall the app"" know that I tried everything already. Please correct the issue.",1
I am not able to log in in my accounts..do something about it !!!!!!!!!!!! The app is legir frustrating...my stories aren't being posted...do something!!!!!!!,1
Sir Instagram is not working on my phone It is opening but not showing any signs. It shows the welcome screen after that it goes blank Please help me out. Thank you,1
Very bad experience Instagram is very bad and it is a mullagram,1
Theme mode is not available And reply mode is also not available,1
Reels voiceover not recording. Force closes. NOTE 8,1
"The latest update is terrible. I use to spend a lot of time in the app, but now it just irritates me! Texts over pictures overlap each other and can't be whole read. Dates when the post was made is like '23 weeks ago' - absolutely useless info! I liked the exact dates to understand when the actions took place or when it was somebody's special day! Please, please, fix this!",1
Well after reading that you share my life story without my say so that's pretty much count me out not to mention all the catfish and hoes that are on Instagram and I reported it time and again and you do nothing about it so I'm out too many catfishing girls selling their photos to married men so on so forth and y'all seem to find that acceptable in your app,1
"Hi Instagram, I would like there to be an option to turn off the auto-scroll function on igtv. It's very annoying to have to fight with the constant scrolling downwards if all I want is to watch a 2 second clip again. Thanks for reading my feedback lol Also the dark mode keeps bugging out and making the app unusable. This happens any time I click on a link in Instagram. The background switches to white, but the text stays white as well, making it very hard to continue using.",1
"If I can rate it zero, I would. Account was verified and I did verify it again with hopes that I could retrieve it but it was permanently disabled even when I didn't do any violation. I am angry about this.",1
I don't know why but from last 3 days Instagram is not working in my phone Other id In other phone is working,1
"I just updated my app, and all my reels drafts are gone. I had planned to post them for my business over time. Devistating!! üò•",1
My account is not working in this app üò£ but it is working in Instagram lite,1
"After last update someone screwed up the sound/mute button on videos. Now when you press somewhere on a video, it expands it which I guess is intentional but I don't find convenient. Anyway... more important - the behaviour of the video buttons/actions is very random depending on different details. Sometimes there is no sound/mute button at all no matter what you do. UPDATE: OMG... I swear with each update you just introduce more and more bugs which make it easier for me to give up on your app..",1
"Since a few weeks, I've only been able to see reels in my feed, and that's really disappointing, that's not ,hat I'm looking for. If I go on Instagram it's to see pictures and maybe some videos from times to times, not some annoying tiktoks all day... I also don't like the suggested accounts to appear in my feed, this is not Facebook, if I want to discover new accounts, I use the discover tab (it's it's function after all). My feed is what I use to follow choosen people.",1
"I AM JUST DONE WITH INSTAGRAM:) Tried posting a video and it was a complete black out. Only the audio is there, not the video. Ever since you started doing these new updates with reels it's an effing mess. You have put the post option on top which is very inconvenient. And now i re-installed the app and IT'S NOT EVEN OPENING. Great work:)",1
What is wrong with the android app?! the login page doesn't show up instead there's a blank page. can't login to my accounts please fix this asap.,1
Everytime I m getting different problems using this app... Its not even boosting any post or reel to get more views or followers... this time Instagram isn't updating followers and unfollow list... Great üò°üò°üò°üò°,1
"Crashes randomly. Updates are never stable. Reels are not adjusted to screen, edges get cut. Replying feature in DM gets problems randomly. Cannot react to messages in DMs other than simple like. Chats don't load. Earlier messages don't load. Videos stop if you touch the screen while it is playing, only sound continues. These problems are not new. These have been going on for more than a year. I was in beta testing and alpha testing. The stable versions are as glitchy as the alpha version.",1
"Cannot upload photos on an android phone. Please fix. Also, please add the frames back. I miss them. Thanks.",1
"I cant open my instagram app. Whenever Im trying to open it, it always turns all white. I've installed and reinstalled it multiple times but its still the same everytime Im trying to open my instagram app",1
"This app keeps bugging out every time I try to follow someone's page. It started after I went and changed my password for both of my pages; every time I'd follow a new page I'd come across, my account would automatically unfollow said page 30 minutes later. It's happening constantly right now and it's really frustrating. Also the new layout for the buttons is rubbish, not to mention glitchy. I really do hope that these issues get fixed soon because right now, I'm not happy.",1
"AFTER THE UPDATE! Volume up/down and return/go back (‚Ü©) button doesn't work. I can't turn the video's volume up basically. While adding a story I can't write something on it because keyboard doesn't start. I can't see the stories top of the screen, it requires couple times of refreshing to see. Latest update completely screwed up the app.",1
Idk.. What's the problem with my IG but its not working I have downloaded ig 2-3 times but unable to use it as it showing a blank screen. Still same after many days,1
So being using this app for like 5 years and it's only getting worse... I have nothing good to say about this platform.,1
I can't post (or even view) my current and recent photos through the app. It's ruining my ability to post regularly for my business. What the hell guys?!?!?!,1
"Overall this app is good but meanwhile it is not working.I don't what happened to this.everthing is blocked at Instagram. Can not share my story,no post no messages,nothing...plz help me",1
"This app will spy our phone like anything. Whatever you search in browser or any shopping apps, with next 5 to 10 mins you will get ads of the same thing what you have searched",1
"Insta has become my least favorite app, so many bugs + account being deleted without any reason üíÄ",1
"Now i can't log in with 2 device with 1 account, after i log in with my first device, my second device force logout",1
"In order to track the user and generate revenue, meta just ruined the whole app experience. Worst experience. Everything is buggy and filled with glitch. And f**d",1
"I'm constantly being blocked from being able to Livestream, use audio in reels and so much more.",1
"Whats wrong with the app? I dont see mesegess, there is no suport. Nobody can help or answer for it. I want to delete my acount",1
"If not for my friends I would have switched to another platform long ago. Please fix all the bugs. My story is always stuck on ""posting"" and the only way to fix it is to uninstall your buggy app. This has happened 3 times already. It is getting extremely annoying. On top of that...engagement has never been more horrible than now, with almost every creator account becoming shadowbanned.",1
"I've been locked out of my account to ""verify my identity"" twice. Ig has disabled my account now and there's no way to appeal it because it keeps going back to me needing to verify my identity. My account didn't violate community guidelines. It was literally a few family pictures and circus training videos. I've had my account for 5 years and now everything has gone. Worst app ever.",1
"Husband is not on my list, I have to actually search for him when I want to send a message and sometimes I can't find him! He used to be the first on my list. I try to scroll the feed in the app, the app just exits to home screen in 3 seconds. I can watch stories but as of today, I can't scroll posts. I deleted the app, cleared cache, reinstalled it, operating system just received a bunch of updates. Huawei Mate 20L. I used optimizer to clear junk, phone has over 50% free storage. I am at a loss",1
"Isn't functional anymore. Every time I post multiple pictures there's a glitch and one of my photos gets copied and replaces the majority of my other pictures, so essentially, every post I make I have the same picture about 5 times. Terrible. Don't even know how you can have an app that literally cannot perform its basic function.",1
I'm not able to use smart message features I can not reply in chat and can't use reaction also,1
What is wrong with this app lately?! I uninstalled and reinstalled it and guess what?? My screen is white and app does not work! Congrats!,1
Internet problem from 2 week it's not working properly it need to solve as soon as possible,1
worst app ever. full of bugs and glitches.,1
Nothing but reels now.. every post I look at on the discover page is followed by reels and only reels. If I wanted to mindlessly watch cringe videos I would be on tik tok,1
"This used to be a great app. Now it doesn't even work most of the time. Like everyone else, I uninstalled and reinstalled several times. Sometimes it would work for 2 or 3 days, but mostly it wouldn't work at all. I could get into the app but couldn't look at anything because it was blurred out and chat communication was limited. IG has been making too many changes lately and this is the result. If it isn't broke don't fix it definitely applies here. Thanks Facebook I'm done with your apps.",1
Bug has made the app unusable. Can't log in to multiple accounts without screen turning white.,1
This apo was good but today I was so angry on this app help term its not help me to logine in my id and if it would not help me I am telling that I will totaly destory this app managment üò°üò†,1
Iam losed last 4 years I used account . Instagram team not checking properly accounts.... Account simply disabled,1
Not able to login to my account even after changing my password and confirming my identity. It shows login error. Fix the damn bug.,1
Worst app ever!!! Can't find my new account from the previous account. Not functioning properly yet after re-installing again and again. Please do the needful!,1
More ads? You really think that's how to engage users? Profile ads are as dumb as the ads in messenger that were tried out too. My account is open but am considering making it private I'd Instagram is gonna be putting ads in my feed.,1
"glitches like hell, most of us cant even get the reply update, top bar always disappears, issues with loading comments constantly. like how is there issues that just didn't exist before?? let alone from a company like this one like what on earth",1
Wont load any messages or post. Too slow,1
Instagram my account has been stoped story posting and so many problems had my account plz check out and solve that problems ok,1
"My page is not working. It stopped working from yesterday as i noticed i couldn't like any feed or go onto any pages including my own. Then all of a sudden everything went blank, i deted the app and tried again and sent in two reports as well as screen shots and nothing has changed. I'm seeing alot of people having the same problem can this be resolved, i had another page and was able to log into that one just fine but now i can't log into it anymore.",1
I have been having some issues with my pet's (bruno_toy_poodle) handle. I have reported the problem but there seems to be no response. I am unable to use messenger feature for chats and also a reel once deleted and restored cannot be brought back to the profile grid. Kindly do the needful. It has become very difficult to work without these features!,1
The app is making it all about reels and yet uploading a reel has so many bugs such as video gets inverted or blurry or both!,1
"So many bugs is in Instagram like in reels, story mention, and other problems such kind of when my frd is mention in story to me at that time I can't mention back of his story...",1
It was good untill the new update now it's messy and when you wanted too look the audio it trows you out of the app now you can't even look reels like before no Fullscreen...,1
Cant install the app like it's annoying. My phone has enough storage because I can install other apps like snapchat and they work just fine. My wifi connection is completely okay and also i restarted my device and cleared all data re updated play store. But nothing seems to work. My android version is also compatible with this version of instagram. Truly disappointed.,1
I'm not able to update the instagram messager though I've updated the app..... please fix this!!!! Still haven't fixed it! Its edited...and instagram still dint fix it:/,1
Increase the post frame ratio. Give direct download option into mobile gallery. Like save to Mobile Gallery. After you provide these options I will give full out of full rating,1
Too many glitches recently. Can't upload videos without it taking days. Then I can't cancel upload so that u can switch to the other profiles that I manage. I'm a social media manager. These glitches just make things harder than it ought to be and it's frustrating. I had to uninstall and reinstall several times.,1
I recently tried to send a video to my friends at it has been stuck on sending for lmthe last couple days. Due to this I havent been able to switch accounts or delete the message. I have tried different Internet connections as well as deleting the app please help me fix this issue as soon as possible. This is a good app to be honest but I will not rate it any higher until this issue is fixed.,1
"The latest update just changed the whole app. It's awful. Hardly any posts visible from the people I follow, just ads, suggestions and reels from people I don't follow. The layout is clunky and cumbersome. The audio plays automatically without the option to turn it off besides on the post itself. Posting is getting more complicated. And you never listen to your users. You destroyed something fun and wholesome for no apparent reason. Seriously, one star is about 5 too many",1
Please help me...i have deleted instagram couple of days before...yesterday again I reinstalled instagram...but I was not able to open the app....It showing a black screen...please help me to fix this issue....,1
The new update is riddled with bugs. Ruins the whole experience,1
"Had the app over 7 years, everything has always been good, however over the last few months videos in the app have been glitching causing my phone to freeze and restart. Now all videos glitch and cause my phone to restart, making it very difficult for me to use the app altogether. I've tried updating the app to no avail. Reading other reviews seems there must be a big issue going on, and as a major player, hopefully instagram resolves these issues soon.",1
"I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU ANY STAR COZ I HAVE PROBLEM ON INSTAGRAM AND IT'S NOT SOLVING FROM A MONTH THE PROBLEM IS WHEN I OPEN A INSTA THE SCREEN BECOME WHITE AND NOTHING ELSE IS SHOWING ON THE SCREEN SO, IF IT IS POSSIBLE SO SOLVE IT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.",1
Hi insta Actually I am having an error in my insta whenever i uploaded videos in insta it says we restrict certain activity to protect our community. I am uploading just normal videos nothing else please help .,1
Hi instagran i love this app a lot but i cant get access to my account cause i cant get the verification code on my phone ive tried different ways pleas help me get back my account i have lost my backup code accidentally i have no way else i cant even receive my code please help me,1
It's full of crappie people selling ugly trainers . No matter how many things I tap on that im not interested ( nike mungral looking jordons) they still pop up .,1
"Filled with bugs, I tried to log in to a new account and it showed my a black screen, I uninstalled and installed and now it just shows me a black screen everytime I enter the app",1
"This App sux you can only control your notifications as the developers ""LET"" you.. It looks like they are just using people to behavior control, this app is like one big narcissistic group of App developers. I think I'll just uninstall.",1
It doesn't show me the login option the screen it totally black pleases resolve my problem this app is totally useless I have been waiting for 1 month,1
I've not been able to open or use the Instagram app now for 4 day's. Everytime I try to open it goes blank and shows a black screen. I've cleared the cache and data. Deleted the app & installed it again. I've alao restarted my phone many times. My phones fully up to date. Yet no luck. Please sort this out! As I'm not the only one. It seems to be for Samsung user's only.,1
Having the most horrible experience. I've 2 accounts 1 personal 1 business and since your new update I can't get into my accounts. There's an unknown error. Your help center isn't helpful. I've reset passwords and still can't get in. I've never had issues before. Think it's ridiculous not to have a chat live where someone might be able to shed some light on the situation rather than playing a guessing game. I've even tried the selfie video and supposedly that's not me. Absolute joke.,1
"The latest update somehow made the stories feature disappear from the home page. I don't know if it's just a glitch in my phone or a weird design choice the devs made. If it is a design choice, please undo it. The stories feature is the main reason i installed the app in the first place. With it gone, i might as well uninstall it.",1
Worst its slow the app and always show couldn't refresh fees,1
"Despite the existence of an Edit button for Reel covers after posting, I am still unable to edit or change reel covers. Please have this issue fixed, Instagram",1
1 out of 5 stars because the captions on your reels don't work correctly and reels will randomly fail to post and are deleted. I legit am sad I can't give you as lower rating.,1
Not working properly..i have to uninstall and then reinstall on everytime use. Still hang on every use. Issue has not been resolved since then,1
The app become useless bc I can't find the stories of people I look for the most until I search for them and access to their profiles and this is uncomfortable so that's made me preferring to not use the app,1
"It really irritates me that even though in the Play Store I have all Auto-updates turned off, this app bypasses it. Buried deep in the app, in an area that isnt at all intuitive to access is its very own ""Auto Update"" setting. Surprise! it and many other settings are on by default. Refresh my memory- who owns IG again? Riiiiiiiiiiiiight...",1
So many times this app keeps blocking me for liking or unfollwing people then sending me a message saying I've been blocked for so many days and that I shouldn't share my account. Well that's wrong for a start because I don't share my account no wonder Instagram is getting on everyone's nerves I am the account holder not a bot nor do I share my account please for the last time Instagram sort your app out!,1
"A few weeks ago, I logged out from my account and now that I'm trying to login again, it's just not happening. I tried to uninstall and re-install the app but nothing helps. The screen is blank.... No pop-ups for logging in appear. I've been tired of this now. Tried instagram lite but the interface is just not user friendly. It annoys me all the time. Please fix the bug or whatever. The app used to be good enough for me earlier but this has pissed me off.",1
It doesn't even deserve a single star I'm trying to upload and when I enter caption for it there is a technical error and the post or reel is not getting uploaded I'm vwry disappointed with Instagram,1
Maybe if your developers weren't all diversity hires the app would still work properly...? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑,1
"Why does my instagram stays in white screen, it does not function?! I've installing and uninstalling if for countless times and stays the same! Please fix it!",1
"Worst app ever. I've been using it more than 8 months and I've kept this app updated frequently. But I unable access all the handy features which are given to others ( I didn't get an option to change my theme while others can, I can't tag a msg in typing which makes the conversation so inconvenient etc).I have heard that these all features would be installed gradually after we created the app. But it took a long time for me. Hope you would fix it soon as possible!!!",1
"Instagram has absolutely no sense of identity any more - in the endless quest for monetisation it's trying to be a shopping platform, a blatant Tik Tok knock-off, a YouTube competitor and... maybe a photo sharing app (have they forgotten about this?) It's also swamped with ads, to the point that a solid 25% of my feed is just promoted posts. I've had an account for years, but it just gets more unpleasant to use every time it updates.",1
I don't know what happened my Instagram feed it suddenly started working weirdly I can't see memes and other stuff it only shows some scenarios and all Plz I'll hope you will fix this as thanks.,1
Facing a blank screen whenever opening the app . Tried multiple methods to fix it but still not working.,1

"Face lots of problem while chatting ,no option of chat background change ,no more option of reaction ,specific reply to massage aren't given ...lots of trouble facing from last 1 year but no solution i report the problem many but no action tell",1
"Slowly and slowly this app is becoming a god damn hub for advertising. Everywhere I go on the app there is an advertisement. As if that wasn't enough, Facebook decided to mess up the original position of the feed and upload post button by adding a shopping page dedicated to more advertising. There's also the video reels feature which its only purpose is to compete against some other godawful app. About a majority of the updates to the app were useless additions/changes which nobody asked for. üñï",1
Reels upload poor quality even after changing settings to allow higher quality uploads. And even when using wifi/cellular combination,1
"I can't use my page is all white... can't read my messages ,I updated the last version and nothing is working. I need help I have this problem since 8/17/022 ,pleaseeee I need to know what's wrong?",1
"They created two fake accounts, one of them is using my profile picture. Are slandering and slandered me. I reported it and nothing was done. I would like you to take appropriate action or I will call a lawyer.",1

"The report function is so darn lengthy and unnecessary, you can't even do it without being as detailed as possible but the real problem is the scope of the particulars aren't even complete",1
Not updating. Showing old post not showing things you want to see. You have to keep refreshing. This update is stupid.,1
Had to change my rating. The 2022 algorithm changes to this app are atrocious.,1
There is a problem after i updated the app. The reels are not opening. Even the help corner is not opening.,1
"The latest update and algorithm change sucks. The app is extremely buggy and you can't send photos as messages anymore. Instagram is shoving reels down everyone's throats now and the algorithm screws over photos. If you're a photographer on Instagram, I highly suggest moving your work to Flickr because they actually appreciate photography. This morning, I lost the ability to view people's stories. Instagram is being killed by the developers. Change it back.",1
"These last few updated have been horrible on my 8.0.0 android, S7 Galaxy. I get white screens opening DM posts or going back to main, almost all the time. Many posts are not fitted in the frame. Even if they are, whenever i zoom in and let go, it doesn't go back to its proper frame. I tried clearing the app's cache and then reinstalling but it wasn't fixed.",1
It won't let me login on anymore even when I get my password right. Keeps saying they can't complete that request. So now I litterally can't use the app anymore,1
This App has not been downloading videos or photos very well for the past 6 months. I've tried to update to no avail.,1
"Instagram keeps crashing on my phone again. After you fixed it the first time it started crashing, the same problem has occurred again. Now, when I open the app, it continuously says, ""Unfortunately, Instagram has stopped working"". Please fix this and also the issue with IG stories (I can't share posts to my story, whenever I take a picture to post, it is shown as black and I can't write text). I've reinstalled and restarted a hundred times and nothing changed.",1
"Used to be good but they have ruined it. It simply doesn't work anymore, I try and post a photo and it only brings up a handful of random photos.",1
"there is another bug in instagram .once we logout insta when i am trying to login there is showing again and again (sorry ,there was problem with your request) ...i am so irriteted now that piss me off ..plz solve this problem asap..",1
"yall messed up 2 of my accounts and do not respond to reports for problems or bugs. Also its messed up you have no call center. To many bugs, and all your 5 star reviews are from bot accounts. Instagram is failing miserably.",1
The app is just getting worse and worse. It's frustrating. My whole feed has just disappeared. I haven't used the app for a whole week now and it's just the same.,1
When I try to add am account it's a black screen. This is still happening after a month of re-download.,1
"Worst update, after last update there is only showing Facebook friends on post sharing. Everytime of post sharing we need to search and send. Can u plz fix this problem.",1
Facebook is dangerous. I hate how my profile was recommended to Facebook friends because my accounts share the same phone number I wanted a public account separate from friends and family...,1
Worst experience ever from Meta !! Instagram is becoming boregram !! Don't show notifications .... Full of problems...as if it was made to be problematic üò°,1
Really worst app. Incorrectly disables accounts based on bad technology and makes it even more difficult to get the account back. Been having issues with choosing different time frames for the music as well. Can't choose anything else other than the default 15 seconds. Instagram REALLY needs to get a grip & have better customer service options!! Fix your bugs & allow for better options to gain back disabled accounts!,1
"Keeps glitching and closing. Already tried clearing cache, uninstalling and reinstalling but it's the app that's the problem",1
dms keep bugging and now refreshing the page doesnt even work anymore,1
"This has happened again a year later, what is going on. I have a Samsung S10+ and since the last couple of updates I haven't been able to post photos onto my pages, I open up gallery and the photos aren't there and there is no next button. I really like Instagram but not happy with it at the moment and yes I have unistalled and reinstalled and that didn't help.",1
I should be able to save my own reels to my own device. The fact that this feature has disappeared is just ridiculous.,1
Can't see comments for videos anymore. Stop refreshing the feed. I keep losing the thing I was looking at each time I have to put my phone down,1
Not loding anything find the new bug and fix it My account not opening,1
This app keep stopping so much take long to to get on it and talk to people,1
"This app never works, reels never work for me without glitches that make it impossible to use. I also have multiple scam accounts that are pretending to be me to scam my followers and IG does nothing. This one used to be fun and now it's just a mess",1
The most irritating thing is not being able to turn sound off of a video when you select the prompt to continue watching the video and not being able to go back in a video on a post. In fact my list is much longer but who cares anyway. Otherwise the app is just fine...,1
Best app for singles you get many online sex prostitutes . They gave video call satisfation and charge money . Instagram should give them blue tick also to know there which one is best üòÇüòÇ,1
YOUR STUPID IS NOT SHARING MY STORIES TO BOTH MY INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK!!!!!! ITS ONLY SHARING TO INSRAGRAM WHEN I CHOOSE TO SHARE IT TO BOTH INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK...THIS IS HAPPENING TOO MANY TIMES AND IT IS FRUSTRATING HAVING TO RESHARE IT ALL THE TIME!!!!! FIX THIS NOW!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"After the updation, it should be user friendly or something new which should be hassle free. But this updates are literally useless. It loosing interest for using this application.",1
"Sometimes, It was very difficult for me to log in this app , there show Error and try again after few min, but there has nothing, it's very Rediculous!",1
"Been having issues about not having the latest features for a long time (no quiz option, no picture options). Contacted the andriod support team since 2 werks ago but there hasnt been any reply. This is frustrating to say the least and support is poor and lacking for such a big company. Im utterly disappointed but guess there's nothing much you can do when the app is free and everyone is using it.",1
Too much glitch ... Sometimes it's impossible to open Instagram .... I have to uninstall it and install it again ...just feeding my internet data .,1
My Instagram reel option is not coming but in other account reel option is show on there app And also my account is public still my reel reach are only to my follow there like are only come I used hashtag location all I don't know what was the issue please help suggest me on this. Thanks,1
"New app layout is bad design. Moving the notifications button from where it has been for years and replacing with a store which you clearly make commission on, is exactly why people hate Facebook. Clearly an intentional design to replace the most used button with the store, so people would accidentally keep pressing it. Nobody wants to do their shopping through an app owned by Facebook. This is a photo sharing app!",1
"This app was terrible and now it's the worst app, I wish instagram bring back the ""older post"" i missed some post from my followings and cant get back to them for a while. plus, insta need to come up with a features where i could adjust my explore page to my likings and stop showing pages that I'm not interested in, or maybe by certain keywords that I don't wish to know about, i could put it on mute so it never show up on my explore page. it would be a convenient that way.",1
"Literally will not launch anymore, there wasn't an update nor did my phone update either. It just crashes and I can't read my dm's now. Great",1
Bad experience. My account got suspended by stating that I am not following community guidelines. But I didn't post or do anything wrong on this platform but still it got suspended. I want it to be unsuspended as soon as possible.,1

Tried manually installing from apk mirror too, but doesn't fixed. Developers, please do fix this.",1
"the new design with ""following"" and ""favorites"" is awful and it takes away the functionality of the app. now the feed is useless.",1

"The meta company pls check and repair the bucks for Instagram like can't add another account, can't switch another account, the reel section can't see properly, DM section is not working properly",1
A stupid social networking app that don't consider our request even if reported for being hacked. Users be sure you remember your password all the time since u need it to recover your profile once hacked. Don't be like my dumb friends who never remember the password,1
Way to many ads and I have to see things that I did not follow,1
Worst appüòñüòñ crashing now an then. It's burning data to great extend and also has a shitload of bugs. I am about to uninstall this app and move on to some other appüò°üò°,1

Video upload on android look like trash.now the reel mostly show indian videos and im not even from india,1
This app has suddenly started removing the saved drafts when you log out of your Instagram I'd. Previously it was done when you uninstall the app but now it's on logging out .,1
Super nonsense app. Whenever I want to check my insight on every post the tab just closed down n I end up on the home page . And it's disgusting..,1
"There has been so many issues with the app lately. Firstly, I've not been able to share mine or anyone else's IGTV videos on my story. The option was there a few days back but then suddenly vanished the next day. It came back the day after but it again went after some time and now it hasn't returned yet. I updated to beta thinking it will fix this and it did but then I wasn't able to upload any high res image. Any high res image I upload turns into a complete solid grey frame. So I reverted back",1
"i hate the new features, i hate only being shown reels, if my pals would stop using it as the only way to get in touch with them, id delete the app alltogether.",1
"Account hacked , no customer care at all . No-one to contact for help. Unbelivable. Neither Facebook Instagram or Meta in general are reachable, no email no phone .",1
"The days of viewing who I follow has gone, random posts, no order people not seeing mine this platform is dead and serves no purpose I urge people not to pay for advertising on this platform! It's 90% bots and wasteful. 9 years on this application, grew to a large number and over the last 4 years my reach is currently at 0.1% of my following, Not worth my time to produce content",1
Not working properly all tha I have clear data then opening properly üòü,1
"I don't know what is wrong with Instagram but I've been trying to use it for the past few days and it keeps stopping, I even reinstalled it for about 10+ times but it still won't work, I submitted a report but it did nothing. Also I've noticed how in the past few months Instagram is becoming a shopping app instead of being a normal social media platform. I hope instagram will fix this problem as soon as possible before I switch to another platform.",1
"After installing the screen goes black when i try to open the app, tried reinstall, phone restart , phone firmware update , cleared data cache but still i am experiencing same",1
i did not have replied option in my chat box only like option is available for reacting someone's messeges,1
Utterly dreadful interface. An aggravating useless piece of rubbish. For a platform that generates the amount of money it does this is nothing short of embarrassing.,1

When I try it on my personal account it's fine, but it's not working on the new account. I have tried multiple fixes both through the app and my phone and nothing has worked. Really, really annoying. If I didn't HAVE to use Instagram for work, then I wouldn't bother.",1
"new update is awful. i cannot easily access the features i want to use, and it makes me not even want to open the app. i want to post pictures and see who liked them, not shopping. i also do not care for the reels. i don't understand why something that worked for its purpose (posting photos) had to be overhauled for a completely different goal (to try to replace tiktok?). it feels like the platform is losing popularity BUT because using it changes so suddenly, the process will speed up.",1
Video not playing smooth ..so many glitches worst response by Instagram,1
I've wait for long long time to change my name and it's so freaking annoying for me,1
"So, I love Instagram and all but I have been facing a problem lately.

My account is being hacked ....secure ur account is not working .....even my phone is not receiving sms for confirmation code .....even I can't able to make new account.i am not receiving sms from insta about code ....,1
It won't let me sign in to my account because it doesn't send me the sms code even though I've tried it many times so now I cannot use Instagram at all. I wish this problem would be solved.,1
I logged out and now I can't log in because I just keep getting a white screen. Tried everything to fix it and nothing works.,1
It's suddenly stopped to work. Gives only black display. Lite works but not as full app. Help,1
Used to love insta but now my feed is littered with so many adverts and other irrelevant rubbish that I have no interest in that I'm considering deleting. Looks like someone has got greedy!,1
I've had a white screen for a month now. I can't even login to my Instagram. I've tried everything to fix it but nothing works.,1
"Why are you trying to copy TikTok? There was nothing wrong with the previous layout. I can't see translations any more. And I can't stand the background colour you randomly choose to fill the area, it takes the focus away from the actual post. It just looks so messy now, I don't actually want to spend any time on the app.",1

"Instagram takes a lot of data, my data ends quickly with little use üò¢",1
"The reason I am giving it 1 star is that it doesn't enable the same features to all users at a given time. I have 2 profiles and on one I have story preview for instance, on the other no. I had it and then it vanished, like it was revoked. That's just one example. For Questions I waited 4 months before I had them in my stories. The new fonts appeared and disappeared almost immediately, as well. It limits you from using certain content forms and content due to this. Help and appeal - no reply.",1
My insta not work properly could not be open feed and not refresh,1

My instagram app does not display the sign up/log in features. I can't log in my account and can't use instagram because it doesn't work.,1
Having problem with instgram camera the pictures I click are too stretchy. I reported this problem to Instagram help centre but my problem remains unresolved. This is not acceptable from Instagram please fix my issue asap,1
After update it's not performing fine Stucking bug,1
I have had complained many times but no response or action .I am not able to reply to msgs individually .this is literally very bad service from instagram. 9 months since i had complained but no response till now .very disappointing.,1
I updated the app twice but it's not showing any updated features.... Tag option is not coming while we reply to the message......,1
"The Notifications ‚ô° button has been replaced by the shop button, even though I don't have a shop through Instagram. Now every time I try to access my notifications via the profile, the app crashes and I can't see them! Why would you do this??? Why remove the notification button altogether? It's ridiculous and now is causing issues in the app itself.",1
"I had deleted my account and started again but after that instagram app is not opening in my mobile even i restarted and uninstalled and reinstalled and imported it from friends phone, instagram app is not opening, tell me what to do.",1
App is rife with glitches and bizarre levels of inconsistent censorship. Low quality development. No longer an enjoyable social media experience.,1
"HEY INSTAGRAM I apparently got logged out of both my devices cause of ""unusual activity"" like everytime I log in one device I log out of the other now it has logged me out of on both my devices and even after I press the recaptcha thing and press next it says error ü´† like I just post art and it's basically my portfolio so can I get some assistance with this ?",1
"I do like instagram, great way to stay connected and keep up to date friends. Since the new update where old posts are no longer visible it's tedious to navigate and interact. If I wanted to see the discover, which I did use often, I would go to that at the bottom. It discourages me from using the app. The massive block for ""reels"" as well, I prefered when you could see smaller individual posts that could actually pertain to my interest in things I've interacted with instead of popular videos.",1
"It's absurd that I have to install the app every time I try to click a link in the email!! The website actually opens for a split second, then I am routed to install the app or I can't view anything in the email. Facebook Messenger does the same thing so I simply stopped using FB messenger. Your loss...",1
Im also facing that black screen problem....please either fix it....or update it further...old versions are working properly...but this version is showing oy black screen...please fix it asap.,1
"Not letting me add multiple photos in one post, and adding ""features"" that no one wants! Get a grip, Meta! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨",1

"Hello Instagram team ,your Instagram is hanging and lagging too much from recent update...kindly can you fix these prblm.when ever i spend 2 mints more time on insta its getting hang. Fix this issue..",1
"Full of bugs. Edit: do you actually have QAs? I can't with this app anymore.. atm, all the people I chat with are gone when I try to send them something (photo/video, posts/reels etc.) I get random groups at the top, I have to search every person separately and that person is at the bottom of the filtered list.. I can't use filters, I coudn't record videos, I couldn't watch videos sent to me and many more bugs I can't write, running out of characters, fix your unusabl app before adding features",1
Dear Instagram team i have an issue with chatting I am not able to reply options on my Instagram I'd please check and solve that issue,1
All I'm seeing is a white blank screen every time I go into Instagram. I'm not sure if it's my phone or its Instagram itself. It's really annoying.,1
"I'm really disappointed. App is not working in my phone. I tried so many times, I installed and uninstalled several times to ensure what's the problem. But it's still not working. Only a blank white page appears every time I open the app. Please work on it. It was my favoraite app. Hope Instagram will improve. I want the app back.",1
It asking update daily still showing the old features and lot of bugs,1
"After uninstalling and reinstalling for a couple of times in the last 3 weeks, IG is still not working. White screen through and through",1
"As a millennial, I miss the picture-focused platform that IG was originally. I like having access to video stories and reels, but I hate that those are what are primarily promoted in my feed--along with ever-growing numbers of ads. I counted: for every ten posts on my feed, SIX were ads for products or pages. That wasn't the case originally, and I don't know how in the world IG leadership sees this as something sustainable. I don't want to spend time on an app that is 60% forced advertisement.",1

"Instagram is my go-to app for the past years since 2013. I'd like to report an issue which I have been experiencing lately. Since the latest update, whenever I took a photo from the camera using filters, and everytime I try to save it, it automatically pops up a notification on the screen that the photo has been saved. BUT WHY DO THE PHOTOS I TOOK DO NOT REFLECT ON MY GALLERY IN REALTIME? IT HAS SOME KIND OF GLITCHY DELAY OF THE PHOTOS TO BE IN MY GALLERY. PLS KINDLY FIX IT IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.",1
Recently this app has become a worst one Because i can't keep my any videos as story.....this bug or something else issoo frustrating hope insta fixes it soon....üòêüòê,1
"App has been working perfectly for the last 2 years but for the last week it's been very disappointing. It won't refresh. Can't get any feed. I have deleted the app and re installed, i have logged out and back in and switched phone on and off. I tried everything people have recommended but still not working üòï üôÉ",1
Since the most recent update I can't upload more than 1 picture at a time. I'm using a Note 20 Ultra and have always posted from Gallery on my phone.,1
"This app is very bad because I have done everything in trouble, but the option of Swipe Replied not coming and I have updated it many times. Please provide me as soon",1
It's totally bad don't West time in Instagram if you want to viral your real so use MX taka tak because it's better than Instagram. I worked on Instagram 4 month but nothing happened.,1
Dame blank screen issue for weeks now as for a lot of others here. Can't get in touch with them no general troubleshooting on my own works.,1
"As others have said, this USED to be my favourite app. I hate that you can't click on content and reels on the one page anymore. You are forced to cycle through a bunch of reels instead. The app is much less user controlled now and irritating to use. It is not intuitive. I knew when Facebook took over they would eventually run the app into the ground. Disappointing.",1
So glitchy. Today can't edit multiple photos.,1
"When I enter the application, a black screen appears. I tried all methods, but It didn't work. Please fix this problem",1
"It sucks. The UI is actual garbage now. Sorry but no one uses the shop feature on instagram. And the people that do have normally have a better optimized shop on a different service already. You're trying so hard to be tiktok with the unlimited scrolling and reels. Most of the reels are reuploaded tiktoks. Also its impossible to see content from people you follow consistently- which was the entire point of the homepage. The explore page worked, people used it why remove it?",1
"I've been using Instagram for 10 years. Used to be fun and easy to use, but now they're trying to take on Tik Tok it's just gotten super boring, complicated, and buggy. I already use Tik Tok which is great, but what I really need is an awesome photo sharing app - like old school Insta! Bring back super fun old school Insta!!! I used to give them 5 stars but now it's down to 1. They've stopped listening to their users because they're too busy obsessing over Tik Tok instead of being original.",1
Because of one star the reason is Instagram is not working in my device I have tried many to times but not opening .when it as opening then i will give 5 stars Really because Instagram is my world . THANK YOU,1
This new version is not good when i just finished epdate we can't swipe to right anymore and we can't react to messages anymore if it's not for this reasons I would have given a 5star,1
"Ever since I updated the app three months ago, it's not working properly. I can't view stories, see posts and send messages. I was forced to download APK from different websites just to use it for temporary. My internet wasn't the problem, neither is my phone. Please fix the issue because I haven't been able to use the original app for months now. Fix it pls!",1
"Heloo this is regarding the problem of uploading of pictures in my profile be it story or the post, it's been a while since I have not been able to post anything because there are no thumbnails of the pictures being displayed it's just a black cubicles that gets displayed. I have tried reinstalling the application, signing in fresh but still nothing. I would be happy if you could resolve this issue for me.",1
"It's really a shame that Instagram decides on itself on how the size of photos should be and doesn't allow users to change it while uploading multiple images. I took a few clicks in Cannon 1300d but I can't post it in its actual size, felt pretty bad. New issue, I've the updated app and I can't create reels!!!!! I'm seeing religious posts in my search area, the problem is that when I try to report the page loads and never shows the options. I think that's some kind of hack please check this.",1
App is good but in my insta account message reactions is not coming only like symbol option is coming please check,1
"It good to got this beautiful application called instagram ,I always know what going on out there and also you the opportunity to see my favorite artist in live together",1
"I can't even login because there's a ""unknown network error""",1
"Why you changed the reels again üò´ that's too bad, we can't see the reel on full screen and so we can't see the location that was added to it, which use to appear when we only watch the reel on full screen! That's too bad, please return the feature it was much better!!!! And now we can't even stop the reel to read something in it!!!",1
"Few days My insta notes option is missing,please fix the bug instagram team",1
"Recent updates have ruined the most basic function of the app; scrolling. It's irritating, inconvenient and just not smooth at all anymore to scroll through the feed. It tries to lock on to each post now when you flick to the next one but it doesn't even line it up properly sometimes so you're stuck halfway between 2 different posts. Just change it back and stop fixing what isn't broken..",1
"So many bug so stressed, for last few days can't follow someone after refresh all following goes to same as before not able to follow public account?",1
This was nice app but there are some issue in my id. There is no feature of swipe to reply and after long pressing on any messages i can react heart only.,1
I had to uninstall the app on my phone but when i reinstalled it it no longer works. I have restarted my phone and deleted data and cache but its still not working üòï,1
"I am not able to get any new dm, and also the texts which I am sending are getting disappeared. I have uninstalled and installed the app again. Cleared the cache. But nothing is helping. M not even getting an option to update to my messages as well in the app. And this is happening from last night. Don't know what to do, is it happening for everyone or just my app.",1
It's not working properly... sounds came first and action came later.... it's mood spoiling...,1
"For no apparent reason, the app randomly starts to not load certain things until it just decides to again the next day. So I have to use the web version, which runs at snails pace and is annoying to use.",1
"So much irritating I have uploaded a story and it is showing your video is deleted because it's not available in some country,and if I send a msg to someone it will open another person's chat camera. I'm done with this app.üòë and now the new feature note is invisible.üò¨",1
"Suddenly my page is bugged out and not a single post or story is being shown. I don't know what or how it happened but nothing is showing on my account. Also no comments are being loaded in at all, I logged out, changed passwords, restarted my phone, and even redownloaded Instagram but to no avail. I have no idea how to fix this problem.",1
Cannot open the app after the last update. It opens up and crashes in few seconds,1
I have been trying to reinstall the app 20+ times already and it's always blank. I don't know why. I have to use other phone to use it. It looks like it has a bug or something.,1
"Useless, not needed after all. Waste of time for kids just like facebook.",1
i tried many time but can't login i Don't know what's the problem literally said can't login,1
I have been uninstalling and reinstalling this app for the nth time and still having the same issue. I still can't log in or do anything.,1

"Please fix latest issue; I've finished several posts and it won't post them like usual! It gets stuck while trying to upload, despite having good uninterrupted wifi connection, and same happens everytime I refresh or reopen the app. I can't go back to editing mode either, so all the editing and writing is lost as the only thing I can do is to discard the post. Keeps crashing mid posts editing as well!",1
Very bad experience since my I'd has been created there is no reply and react on chat messages I have reported several times but no action is taken till now. Please Instagram fix this problem. And mmany users are facing this problem,1
"I enjoy using the app but unfortunately, I can't log in my account since yesterday until now. I wanna know why and I hope you fix the bug issues of this app ASAP. Thank you.",1

However it hasn't worked AT ALL for the last 5 months. Please help!!!!! I have reported this problem multiple times. But NOTHING has changed.,1
"There are several reasons why I'm giving 1 star. PLENTY of bugs. Some pages simply don't load, I don't get any message notification at all, I've tried everything to fix this problem, but it's just the app. If I want to post a reel on my story, it posts only one image of the post, but it should be the video itself. Also, the algorithm keeps showing me things that I'm not interested at all! I've deactivate my account many times for this reason. I'm just here bc of my friends. Actually hate the app",1
Why cherrapunjee ( now known as Sohra) is not listed in the address list. I want to create a professional account and insert the business address but cannot since the city list its not valid,1
"I made an account and they diable my account by saying that it violate our community rules, however i just made that account 2 or 3 days before and just post the product pictures with descriptions, Very bad experience",1
the new like heart position just keeps me redirecting to the profile of the persons comment cause its too small to hit.,1
"Same issue as many other people, it's been a very long time since my IG app stopped working. It keeps on saying ""Couldn't refresh feed"" to which I've restarted the app, restarted my phone, uninstall the app and reinstalled. I still doesn't work and I can't figure out why. If this is a bug then please fix it because it is very annoying not being able to use an app for its intended purpose only to be met with some insane error.",1

"Such a irritating bug if not recieving ir sending DMs on time although the network is great. Post doesn't load amd stops in between, crashes, and most importantly even after updating it is still the old version. Its version update depends on device and that pisses me badly! It shows some changes in story, fonts, theme (specially), color bubbke text msg and then disappear after sometime. In some device it is and others its not! So I am having a bad experience these days!",1
Every time problem....for message... And reels....for... reboot.... Instagram,1
It was great and stuff before I went to switch Instagram account and everything crashes. The screen goes completely white. I've tried restarting my phone and reinstalling the app but nothing.

Been using Instagram for long. I definitely like the app but today I'm not able to add any pictures as my story. Only videos are loaded. When I try to upload a picture as a story it becomes blurred. It's so annoying. And after that it stops loading the feed as well. Keeps saying couldn't refresh!.. Please help to fix this.,1
"In the last week, (on a Huawei P30 Pro) I have been unable to post multiple videos in a single instagram post. They upload with the progress bar, the progress bar changes to says ""posting"" (""publiserer"" in norwegian so not entirely sure what the english version says) and then says ""the photo cannot be published"" (""bildet kan ikke publiseres""). There is no explanation for why. I have also tried swapping out one video at a time to see if one is being caught by any automatic screening and it is still not being posted therefore it doesn't seem to be this. I have also tried reporting the problem but have received no support and also when I try to check if my request for support was received in the help centre, it does not show my reports of the problem so it seems like this feature isn't working either. Would be great to get info on why something is not able to be posted so that it can be adjusted.",1
Anytime I try to do anything on this app it tries to get me to add my phone number and when I try to get rid of that screen it just pops right back up,1
"This app is buggy, doesn't tell why you mess up on a post and is too complicated to use for posts that involve more than one photo.",1
"After recent updates to the phone and app, it has not worked while on high-speed wifi but works with data and slower wifi. Among other apps with similar issues Edit: Still does not work and starting to see other reviews from people having similar issues with their Android phones. Blatant lack of concern from the developers of many apps including Instagram/Disney Plus/HBO Max etc. Fix these apps for Android or start losing subscribers and/users period.",1
I can't even see reply option in my account.. And i can't like with an emoji for a post that have been sent I reported this problem So many times to the Instagram team It have not fixed yet??,1
Fed up from this app like my account was not openning many times i havd msg insta but nothing is there,1
"Won't let me see anything anyone posts. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, logged in and out. Squadoosh.",1
Worst app ever...it doesn't even let's me upload story yr if I'm uploading a story it agains deletes it like in seconds...this app frustrates me so much dude even after updating this app it works like garbage,1
App keeps crashing. Not able to open the app at all. Switching to Instagram lite.,1
"What an absolutely awful app. It's littered with ads (every 3-5 posts containing things completely unrelated to your feed), doesn't have good features like AMOLED dark mode, has awful video playback (quality drops, can't skip through video, can't pause). The only reason I still use it is to keep up with the people I follow.",1
"I cant login to my account 4_riey, i already change the password, reinstall the apps, open in another device and web. But it keep said 'Sorry, there was problem with your request' What is this and no online solution or contac your support email?",1
Manu glitch in Instagram any person message me but not showing me,1
It doesn't deserve even 1 star. Used tobe a good app but now it's full of bugs. It disables your account eventhough you haven't done anything wrong.,1
"Latest update is annoying. Now when scrolling down through posts and I open one, when I hit back, it takes me back to the top of the posts, rather to where I was when I opened the post. Also, would be nice if Explore feed was customisable - new update has plonked large video at top of the feed, don't want it, should be an option to turn on or off.",1
"A place to create, explore, connect, learning and much more. Hope instagram keeps thats way by not changing user interface homepages continuosly without second thought. And editing reels should be much easier than to edit in other app. In this regard we need much more users friendly edit options in reels. Collab is a great feature update from last year.",1
Very baad experience with this app . Instagram team suspended my Instagram account without any reason .,1
"It was a perfect 5 star, then it stopped letting me join those ""add yours"" things. It also just randomly tells me that I'm not eligible for branded content? Like once a week",1
"What's up with the new UI?! Half of the images are covered by the name of the creator and stuff they wrote for the post. Furthermore, while before you could scroll nice and easily down, in a flowing manner, now it's clunky and goes on ""ticks"" like with the IG Reels. Pretty bad really, especially so when you're on your home page and just want to scroll all the way down since you've seen most of the outer ones earlier on. I am considering installing an older version, because this one ain't good.",1

"This new redesign is horrific and ugly. No one cares that much about reels and its horrific to see Instagram try to push features, like the shopping tab, when it was fine how it was. Having small adverts for clothes in pictures was fine, but now if feels heavy-handed and terrible. Having to go to the top of the screen for the explore page is unnatural, and having reels on the explore page was just so much better. I'm honestly moving to a different app for content until Instagram changes.",1
"It shows a white bar on the bottom where the navigation buttons would have been on earlier versions of Android. Turning on dark mode shows me white text on a white background. I can't turn off ads about drinking, gambling, luxury apartments during a housing crisis, childcare, or products only available in the US. There's no option to pause IG reels and the videos are often pixelated in green. It also crashes when I tap on a post inside a story.",1

When one person is constantly stating that he/she is not interested in particular post or video then why the hell it's appearing in search again and again.

This comes at a bit of a disadvantage for myself who runs a business page as my business is not reaching people like it used to Edit: Adding onto my earlier point - Instagram is now full of bugs and crashes frequently. The ""photo cant be posted"" error is also extremely fustrating",1
Being an influencer. When Instagram disabled my account for adding music available from Instagram I was heartbroken that seven years hard work went down the drain.,1

Now, not even 8 hrs later, I can't post anything to stories because it comes out to my followers as a black screen!! They can hear me, but can't see me. Story zoom doesn't work and I can only story for 15 sec intervals and then it starts over. Not to mention the stupid algorithm. Fix instagram for Android, the complaints about these bugs go on forever in the app reviews!!",1
The suggested posts on the main timeline has really ruined this app. I'd rather see the posts from the people I follow. Get rid of it!,1

stop trying to copy tiktok and putting down the people trying to reach an audience with this app,1
"The app used to be great and all to text and type and socialize, but there's a bunch of glitches and lags. When you type something the paragraph stays in a small little box where you have to scroll, which it's hard because of the little box. If I ever text for too long the person's username starts to get blank, the top blank as well, and sometimes even messages delayed. With all these problems happening really often, I have to constantly close the app. And keep in check that this has never hap",1
Never experienced such tye of error. Its all black when I am trying to enter Instagram. Fix it as soon as possible.,1
"Horrible experience From last day whatever i am posting is getting zero reach showing a 0 on the insight stats, despite i am getting a good number of comments and share and likes and everything. But still it is showing zero. This doesn't make any sense. And completely illogical. Same is the case with reels and my older posts, the reach has frozen and going nowhere. We work hard for our content and its quite frustrating when your dumb software does this. Fix this as soon as possible.",1
"I don't understand what's going on with the app lately, there are so many bugs and issues. One issue is that I created a new account (business account) and many features aren't in that account like in story mode and Reels are removed all together. Uninstall then installed again and now there's no reel option even in my personal one. Not in explore, nowhere! Also when I open any video there's that mute option which when I click says, ""Instagram music isn't available in your region"", like WTH!!?",1
Had my account locked for no reason. I run my business off this platform so I'm basically starting all over by having to use a new account. Customer support/help center is HORRID.,1
My reel feature used to work pretty good but since 15 days it worked only a few times while it buffered and didn't appear most of the times. This forces me to uninstall and reinstall the app time and again. And even after reinstallation i dont get the reel option most of the times. Even my stories are disturbed and song plays all along even after closing the app. All other apps work good enough except this. Please resolve the issues ASAP!,1
I used to love it but it's just a hellscape of ads and reels these days. that's to say if you can even get the app to run. üôÑ,1
my application is not responding on my device. i already reinstall it but it didn't work,1
Lost a very precious reel draft because Instagram crashed and I had to reinstall. Thanks Instagram!!!!,1
"Utter shite. Keeps shutting down, when inserting photos, from phone, so I have to post to Facebook first, and share to Instagram.",1
It's an utterly rubbish experience using the new update version of instagram.First they displaced the notification button. And moreover I sometimes can't find new notifications at all. I have to reload again and again or just close the app and start again to find the notifications. It also ruined my inbox option. I can't see and reply the messages sent to me. All my old messeges just disappeared. But if I login with my laptop then there is no problem. What's wrong??,1
Always from where filter is used for story that doesn't exit üôÇ,1
I dont know what's happened but this has crashed so many times in the last few weeks and either shows up black or says that it can't refresh my feed. This is really annoying and I can tell from the other ratings that this seems to be acommon issue and its not being addressed. I even reinstalled it 3 times and after a few hours the same problem would occur. How can you have such a popular app and not help consumers with their issues?,1
"The android app is absolute trash. It is barely functional. A lot of times when you send messages it doesn't send until you restarts the app SEVERAL TIMES. Theres are tons of issues with video playback etc, but worst of all in the new update the app completely broke. Nothing works. I can't see or do anything.",1
I can't post photos and videos in mi note 9s Don't show media in input of Instagram,1
"Cannot unlink Facebook stories. I have a public Instagram page that I tried to link to a public Facebook page. Unfortunately it linked to my personal Facebook page. I thought no big deal. The app said I can stop sharing my stories to other apps any time. Wrong! When I try to stop sharing to other apps, I get an error. It says my Instagram is out of date. Yet, I double checked and I have the latest version",1
"My explore page is showing only scenic content...i want my memes, dance n music content backk....whats wrong with it...i tried reinstalling instagram and re login id also..but its not workinggg pleasee fix this issue its very irritatinggg",1
"Now reels doesn't even work it keeps crashing and I have a beefy phone. For being a TikTok ripoff, you're not doing a very good job.",1
"Never wrote a review before ever. But such is the new update its getting the impossible done. It's so horrendous that I've tried uninstalling the app multiple times hoping the new update goes away. And away it went only to come back after I restarted the app. And every freaking time at it. It's so horrible be it reading captions, translating posts or simply scrolling! I've had enough though, I've uninstalled it for good now. I'll come back only if they roll it back.",1
Everything takes forever to show notifications,1
"App stopped working out of the blue. Anything i done received a ""couldn't refresh feed"" error. Logged out/in, even tried uninstalling & reinstalling the app several times. Nothings worked. Trying to contact Instagram was hopeless. Email, Twitter, their website and 5 weeks later, i STILL haven't heard a thing! No idea what the problem is so I'm just going to uninstall and walk away for good. Absolutely useless company since joining Facebook with a worthless app!",1
"The Instagram experience in android just sucks. It seems as if the app isnt optimized in most Android phones, even with the newly released flagships with great cameras. The photos/videos when posted as stories does not do the phone's camera justice. Also for some reason, the option to trim/edit a long video when posting a story is gone; so there's literally no way to edit a video at all. I hope Instagram finds a way to a solution to this asap.",1
Full of nonsenses reels that i dont even want to watch !!! I dont see the posts of the one i followed anymore. Bring back the old version pls !!!!!! It used to be top app but nowü§Æ,1
"The new functions like full hight on all posts has made using the app quite difficult, all of a sudden everything is clickable. And on top of that the algorithms have killed anyone who isn't reposting tiktoks. Instagram was a great place to grow my business, it was a great place to get to know amazing people and now it's sole purpose is to beat tiktok - compromising everyone who was there at the beginning. Now we need to find other social media platforms.",1
"New updates don't work good, some don't even show up. And there are problems with direct messenging, I often cannot review pics and videos and also send them, cannot read a mesege, because it doesn't show up or send it, and I can see that I have mesege requests but I can't read them. Camera effects also don't always work and sometimes there are problems with uploading new pics on my acc. Sometimes there are camera issues during video calls, it zooms the pic too much.",1
Pathetic can't even login it keeps prompting an error,1
"Like so many below- just goes black and then a screen saying I'm locked out for 'unusual activity'. I tried to sort it i n the app but it wouldn't work, then the online change password form did nothing, and the confirmation SMS doesn't come through. After all that I find out that they don't have customer services.. at all!! Very disappointing fail from a company that's supposed to be 'big tech'.",1
"New update very very poor, so many bugs & slowly. I have posted stories, but not send properly & not deleted old stories. Please fixed this problem. Please fast?",1
"White blank page- Cannot open the app. Have deleted and reinstalled multiple times, still won't open!",1
I can't follow anyone Fix this bug Instagram has a problem new update it was error for follow,1
"stop updating more chat features. Also please add friend 's birthday notifications. Being a most used app, it doesn't have birthday reminders.",1
"I went to add my other account onto my profile & it wouldn't work. Every time I clicked on ""add existing profile"" it would load for 2 seconds & the screen would go blank. I decided to let it go and try again later. Well, when I tried it later it was worse. The app itself won't even kick on. It loads the Instagram logo for 2 seconds & then the blank screen kicks on. I've cleared cache and data & Uninstalled & force stopped and nothing so the problem is not on my end. Please fix asap!",1
no audios nd it shows Lyrics not available while using audio,1
So many bugs..üò§ fix it as soon as possible,1
It has so so many bugs. I tried posting a video five times with music. Instead of music it started producing noise. There's no way to edit to remove the music. So you have start the process from scratch. Again the same issue. Finally I decided to put the video without the music. Also there is no one who you can complain to.,1
I can't get onto Instagram everytime I open the app it's just a black screen it's been like this for I think a month I got all the updates and nothing everyone else can use their Instagram but I can't,1

I can't use Instagram no matter how many times I have reinstalled the app. It just doesn't work! I feel like it's time I should delete my account. Pathetic!,1
"It's impressive that when scrolling through stories, every 2 people I slide or swipe through, an ad comes through. Sometimes it's even 2 ads between 2 users. Edit: Now ads even appear on videos and reels. Extra annoying. Edit2: New RE-SHARE sticker feature is absolutely trash and just wastes more time instead of a simple post share.",1
Account disabled without informing the user. Such a bed impression,1

Kindly fix this issue at the earliest. Thank you so much for your support.",1
For some reason I can't drag messages that's very annoying and it's not my old phone it's every new phone I use I don't know what's the issue here..,1
"Almost every day, if not, second day, I have to delete and re install this damn app. I get action blocked every other week, I cant post on my story or on my page, and because you can't switch accounts while uploading something, I cant even use my backup account because I'm unable to cancel the post. So its just constantly posting even though it isnt. It gets to the point I cant even send photos from my gallery to my friends. I try to open direct messages and the app crashes. Please fix this.",1
"Awful experience. I've been having a blank screen for the last 15 days, reported it and nothing has been fixed. I tried restarting phone, clearing cache data, updating phone and app. Nothing. Incredibly frustrating and nothing has been done. Instagram needs to be better and have actual customer service agents to help. Someone you can actually talk too. You make billions of dollars. That's the least you can do.",1
"Stop. banning. me. It's me. Yes, no joke. I'm a real human. Take all of your codes you've sent me. Take my face photos from any angles. We can even meet offline, and I'll show you that it's me just trying to use this app from my phone! It's not my activity being suspicious, it's yours. You ban me for a regular use, it's not normal. Stop protecting me by making the service unusable at all. Yes, I use vpn - I have to, I'm from that kind of countries - is it too suspicious?",1

Boomerangs are shot in widescreen yet Instagram only allows them in a square format when posting a mix of pictures and boomerangs, so half of what's in the boomerang doesn't get into the final edit.

I hope you'll bring back the old version because the new insta is not very much helpful and its really not fun to use anymore. I cannot send pictures to my insta friends like i used to and its really annoying. I dont know whats happening but i hope you bring back the good old instagram that everyone has loved.",1
"As time went by, Instagram became more and more cluttered with basically more app-like features that make it now sketchy and laggy. Sometimes I can't see the thumbnails when I want to post something, the explore page and the algorithm it uses to feed new posts literally makes me quit the app by spamming me with things irrelevant to me. I liked it in the past and I really miss those times back when every app was simple and had only one purpose.",1
When I created a new account I shared my old videos to new one it shows we restrict certain activities it's not fare before updating everything was right but after update it's disgusting so plz kindly fix this too I also reported but no use,1
It's just spam. Nonstop ads. Reels and suggested posts. I don't even see content from the people I follow anymore. They ruined this platform.,1
STOP TRYING TO BE TIKTOK! I just want to see pictures of my friends. This will be the death of this app if they do not change back and listen to us,1
"Latest update us so unintuitive and makes scrolling through photos and through carousels jaggy and absolutely not seamless. It's a photo sharing app pushing for video content but in doing so neglets showcasing people's photos. Other features of the new update are also irritating including the audio being on automatically as you scroll through the feed (with no setting to change this permanently), the captions being hidden and illegible over many photos, the blur around photos in the feed etc.",1
It just goes blank it doesn't show me anything in sort I can't access my insta app for two weeks now don't know what's wrong I deleted n re-downloaded the app many times but still what could be wrong?,1
"The quality of the story was low, please fix the problem",1
The bad outweighs the good by a long shot. I mainly use it for texting and video calls. Camera stutters in video call. Text box disappears in chat. Random crashes. Text box doesn't expand and cuts off the letters. Picture and video editing is horrendous. Text bubbles turn completely white. Chat doesn't load messages.,1
"Worst, it's asking me to login and still loading, I need to login my account urgently, don't waste my time please help me asap, I have important data in my account, am not able go login why? Who the hell are u instagram,",1
Am sorry I have to take down my 5star because since I updated my Instagram app it only shows a white screen any I have deleted and downloaded it back multiple times and even updated my phone but still got no solution I need help on how to have it fixed and make it work again please,1
"Instagram's new update is extremely annoying. If you click on a post to read the caption, when you hit back, it scrolls all the way back up, basically losing where you were in the feed. It's essentially made it too frustrating to use for any period of time.",1
Working features being removed from the profile. Really bad user experience,1
"I see that none of the other reviews on this app have been responded to, and from experience i know that you don't really care, but this app is so technically faulty, it's unbelievable. I'm unable to edit my birthday which is wrongly entered, and because of that instagram keeps disabling my account asking for a photo id. Have submitted it multiple times, but since my birthday is not getting edited, it disables again, for the fault of the app. I know this is pointless and nothing will be done.",1
"Instead of pictures from people and topics I follow or am interested in, now it's a constant stream of stupid videos. If I wanted to use TikTok, I'd use TikTok.",1
"Can't find my viral reel,after updating the new version,though likes and comments are still coming of that video,but it's not showing in my ig anymore.",1
The whole application is full of bugs and glitches,1
"Can't upload videos, always stuck. No progress is shown, you can't cancel uploading too.",1
After the last update follower count Glitch is very common please solve this bug,1
Not able to login to the application. It's telling user not found,1
"The new update is awful! There's hardly any distinction between post and reel. No option to choose the layout either. Older version was much much better! It is so difficult to read the caption in the new update. If a post has a darker background, reading the captions puts so much strain on the eyes. Fix the issue.",1
I had to make a new Instagram account cause my old one got locked.out I spend all day trying to reset my password to get back in and its saying my account no longer exist I have to say this was a bad inconvenience for me and you need to fix these problems for I can get back my old account back,1
"The new interface is awful. Instead of focusing on improving the app through innovation, IG tries to imitate other successful apps which clearly shows now with their newest update ‚Äì an unsuccessful copycat version of tiktok that's full of bugs. At times you can't see how many photos are attached to one post, the tags are hidden and indiscriminately pooled into one pile; captions are clickable and overlay the photo which makes them illegible. Absolutely hate opening up instagram now.",1
"It's seems that Instagram is full of bugs and viruses. Whenever I am opening the aap, it just shows a blank white page and nothing else. Its like a pain. I have uninstalled it many times and again installed the aap a few times. Still even after this the problem doesn't fixes. Please fix this problem soon as I'm not able to use Instagram from last 10 days.",1
"I'd be more lenient if this was indie software, but this is Facebook, and they deserve to go bankrupt. In terms of the software itself - as if it wasn't bad enough that you have to emulate a mobile browser in order to use Instagram on a PC, the browser version isn't even functional. The application retains core design issues, such as limiting you to square uploads, butchering image quality, having non-functional zoom, and a very obtuse system of tags.",1
Reel video stucks usually only audio plays in the background and i am only able to hear audio not video.,1
The app keeps crashing every time I try to open my insights even after I update it. It's delaying my work. Please fix it,1
"this app has gone down in quality. nothing works and everything keeps freezing. additionally, the video posts are glitchy and you can't even watch them as they just glitch out. edit: changed the starts from 2 to 1. now nothing works, you log in and nothing wants to load. posts don't want to post and you can't even look at your feed or the explore page as its just white and says ""can't load"". I'm so tired of this app it doesn't work at all.",1
The glitch.... Like seriously I'm done with this app! Why does it glitch so much? Ruining the vdo and picture quality and then the reach- it used to work well during 2020 times... But now Idk why the developers even ruining the app,1
"Very lag, steak phone and other bugs",1

Add music in post option is not showing up even after updating the app. Really disappointing app.,1
It's worst I'm getting black screen again and again even after so many times rebooting and clearing cache memories.,1
Everything is grey. I tried to look at friends stories and it won't load. Can't even open my other account with out grey icons. Instagram needs an update.,1
Extremely annoying issue where Instagram is wrestling control away from other apps (forcefully swapping active app) trying to force me to enter additional information and such.,1
The app keeps pn closing and has some bug gaht won't resolve,1
Can't turn off autoplay no mater which settings I play with so I get like 40 smal clips in under 20 seconds. notifications broken so I can't get any . Pausing can only be done by holding the screen which is ridiculous . Even if there's 700 foment on a thread you have to start at the end which means taping a small option 30 times yo get to the start of the comments. Whoever designed it like this clearly has some problems with there resume .,1
"Can't see new feeds , can't edit profile details and can't see Following/Followers. I face so many bug from yesterday. Please fixed it as soon as possible.",1
I want to see pictures not videos. I already have Tiktok for that. You will never be Tiktok and you plan will fail. Stop force feeding me suggestions too. Make an option where I only see pictures. Or make a seperate section.,1
I think you should add a option when we download our status it should add song to it,1
"Latest update is horrible. I chose dark mode because I wanted a dark background, not bright coloured gradients that weren't added by the person posting. Smoothly scrolling through was much better than this horrible, claustrophobic and weirdly disorientating mess you've replaced it with. And trying to read captions over the top of images is horrible (and must be even worse for anyone with any difficulties in that respect). What were you thinking?",1
When scroll the page it's became stuck and more bugs,1
literally won't let me post anything. will only let me choose photos I have already posted for a new post and trying to use the other tab only let's me select 1 photo and no more. fix your broken app already,1
"Please stop auto refreshing every time I open the app, I've been already reading a post, 3s later the feed started to refresh and then I'll never find that post again",1
"lately my instagram account can't log in i have tried various ways but it still fails to login, but when i log in on the instagram website it can, please fix it immediately I really need my Instagram account for work and various other purposes",1
"Please, there is something wrong with the app. I am seeing a lot of people also getting the same problem. My instagram is just full white screen, and it keeps loading even though my internet is good and there is nothing wrong with my phone. And also, whenever I send messages it keeps on sending....Can you guys fix it please. Thank you.",1
Full of ads not relevant people and now and interface doesn't allow me to post multiple images direct from on the drop down camera roll only gallery it no longer works correctly for posts,1
"Unable to save and upload videos to stories, tried uninstalling, clearing cache multiple times.",1
Before it was a nice app. Now in 10 posts 7 of them are suggested ads or reels. It's getting annoying to hide them every time.,1
"Currently, if I could I would give 0 stars. I've been using this app an ungodly amount for the last few years, be it for entertainment, business stuff or other and I've seen it go from a somewhat okay platform to if you bought Tiktok from Wish. I won't even be talking about the very bad algorithm but currently, messages do not show up unless you refresh every time, some of my posts appear on top of other's stories and worst of all it's impossible to take pictures for stories. Ridiculous.",1
Very bad experience üòëüòëüòëMy Instagram swipe reply option it's not working I have reported lots of times to Instagram for a help but no response from your side. Please check the problem,1
"Tf is wrong with this app, i want to watch person live but it's freeze all the time",1
"Update is more difficult,it is not showing who likes the reel, so i share the reel without knowing that they may seem that.",1
"Do you guys even give any new features to android users which work on the app or not? Whenever I select multiple pictures & use the feature 'supersync', it don't show anything on the screen, just blank. It didn't work at all. Then what is the need for that update & new feature And 1 more thing, I posted a reel & because of some issue it displayed a message ""Video can't be posted"" after few minutes reel uploaded itself but that message still displaying on my feed. I just don't understand why.ü§∑",1
Too much buggs. Unable to share any story it shows errer try agian try again. If you can't handle then stop updating this app old ler versions are much better .,1
I am not able to achieve story and not see hindi music 5 to 6 time I set music but can't update,1

Its not an easy upload and you cant share to other platforms to reel or normal viewing and app keep getting hung up. I have to unistall every other day,1
The last update keeps crashing. Uninstalled and re-installed same issue. Cleared cache same issue.,1
"All my drafts are gone. Again. Do something about it. I can't keep losing them. You either have a tool that works or you don't have any. You can put some to test out there, but if you keep having bug reports delete the option until it's fixed. Or at least explain what to do in order to avoid the bug. Don't just keep us in the dark with all the pictures deleted.",1
Horrible. Ads every 3rd to 4th post. Keeps crashing over and over. Straight rubbish.,1

"It's been 2 weeks and my Instagram app won't even open. Installed and uninstalled many times, reported the bug countless times, still getting the same Something Went Wrong message.

I'm writing this so others experiencing the same issue can know that this is happening to a lot of us.",1
"I use this app a lot to talk to friends, but it keeps getting more bugs. For example it stops showing me the messages that I send in the chat so I have to get off the chat and click on it again everytime I wanna see the new message or when I wanna send pictures it completely blurres them or the ""send"" button disappears. Honestly it doesn't even deserve one star at this point.",1
When it opens it shows black screen i tried many times to uninstall and install it again but it still shows the black screen fix this problem,1
"Got too many bugs,glitches. Very bad experience using new Instagram updates. Make it stable like iOS. ü§í",1

And now I'm going to re-install again so I can send message to my friend lmao.",1
"Why doesn't it work to click on keep account and activate it since the scheduled time for deletion did not exceed? I tried the link using the app and the browser but it doesn't work. I tried to connect using my phone number, my email or my Id but it said that my account couldn't be found, you gave me a time but you deleted it, how is this possible?",1
After updating today! 22-09-2022 it seems that it is going back in the past updates. Like no reply in messages. Old version looks.. no reactions this is poor app. Zero rating from me.,1
My app keeps closing out as soon as I open it & all of my messages are gone befor then it's just been slow I've done the updates & everything & now I cant get in at all due to it just closing out FIX IT,1
"Couple days ago, my account suddenly locked by Instagram. Then there's this selfie video verification. I tried so many times for 2 days to verify, but the arrow for selfie video didn't show up at all. No trouble with my internet connection, it was doing great.

"bad app veey bad,not able to login with facebook,kepp on telling aleet box please wait some time horrable,what the developers are doing without fixing bugs? insta fired developers I think..nobody reacting to comments",1
"-There is no way to open insta links in the app instead of website since new update! -the story handling has become as rubbish as it can get; you press forward, it goes back or jump to next topic/profile or out..! -often stories are muted and no way to turn sound on! -often feeds jump back to the top unexpectedly and that is most annoying! -there is now navigation bar on albums! -still no navigation on stories and it makes you to use third party insta apps which is mostly prefered to real insta!",1
"The app doesn't want me to log in back , It say that the username I put in doesn't appear to be an account",1
"Bad algorithm. You're giving the options to the user to report or to select ""not interested in this topic"" regarding some post or reel, but still you provide the same content. The ads are awful and very frequent. At least give us the option to disable reels and use the Instagram as it was years ago. Just posts from the accounts you follow, stories, and the chat feature.",1
Glitche. Multiple suggestions and swipe reply not available in multiple accounts,1
The app constantly freezes up. I've had to uninstall and reinstall it about 5 times.,1
Terrible app The updates are glitchy and the ads are extremely kringy and irrelevant plus when ever u post a photo it makes u shrink your photo to a certain size and ruins the quality u want of the post,1

i have sumbit 16 secounds status in story insta recommend in 2 part .....hahahah what hell of this ....if we submit story 30sec. that also automatically recommend in 3 parts so what we submit only 10sec. story in instagram... ???? wrost app ever..,1
I updated the app and it still gets stuck on loading. Y'all suck!!! How can an app get stuck loading a bloody picture!!!!!,1
"New UI replaces post button with a reels ""explore page"". And a marketplace replaces the notifications page. I have to swipe from my home page as if I were posting a story to then slide to make a ""feed post"" as if making a boomerang etc. Who thought of this? Who approved and distributed this change? Every time this app updates, things get rearranged and less intuitive. It's as if the designers and programmers working on this app have no capacity to create meaningful change. Go back to school.",1
The app it self has a lot of problems but the website is a whole nother level of uselessness. By trying to have something from everything it has lost the main point. Not to mention the privacy issues. How about not showing peoples information just because someone has a friend who has a friend who has a friend how has your number from a group of something? p.s if there's an option to turn it off it has to be off by default,1
the app is a laggy mess my wifi is 70down 30 up and instagram struggles to send messages,1
"This has been going for days and I don't know why, whenever I use my instagram I can't see any pictures, no reels and stories to see as if I have no internet connection, my app was updated to the latest version and I already reported the problem twice and still nothing happens, I really hope you can do something about this ASAP because it's really frustrating!",1
During chatting right swipe for specific reply and reaction option not appear in my Instagram account,1
"Honestly.. I've reported this to Insta so many times but l can't seem to get reels, or watch anyone's reels. I don't have access to the marketplace, nothing. On top of that, l can't even find music cos it just says 'music not found'. It's really frustrating. Can someone PLEASE fix this? Cheers.",1

Works when it wants to. Not reliable.,1
"This new layout is absolutely awful. You've removed the easy access for sharing pictures/videos and isn't that the whole point of Instagram? Why can't I remove certain buttons?

"I can't login my account. It is showing ""The username that you have entered doesn't appear to belong to an account"".",1
DOWNLOAD IT ON YOUR OWN RISK. In beginning you'll love it but then after some time it will start deactivating your account for no valid reason. Ever since I've started posting on it every next day my account gets banned or it get disabled temporarily. They'll tell you that your account will be activated within 24 hours but it'll either get you in a week or you'll never be able to get your account back. And mailing them is completely useless cause they're not going reply you at all. DISGUSTINGü§¢.,1

Since yesterday I have noticed an observation that all of my colleagues are listed on my followers list although the platform itself is continuously changing the number of followers without there being a factual removal of followers or unfollows. Either the platform is testing a algorithm on social media or there is or are hackers that are integrated on and in the app.,1
Lately it's been having so many issues. It's been a nightmare to post any content. It should be better considering how popular it is!,1

While I have logged in my app....blank screen appeared and not able to see new feeds and posts on my homepage....My older messages are also not visible in my app,1
I cant switch to messanger icon i have gone to settings to update the app to messanger icon but it not there,1
Cant see gallery. Used to work and niw it doesnt show anything in the gallery so you cannot add anything to a post making it totally unuseable..,1
Tries to too hard to b everything else. Wish I could customise & disable the stories & reels features.,1
Instagram is not working oroperly i have reported but no response. It is continuously closing i uninstalled and installed again but same problem please fix this.,1
I can't reply to messages. Also can't add a reel to profile grid after removing it once. Dissatisfied and disappointed.,1
This app is getting on my nerves now. They don't even let me log in my account. How bad it is. I uninstalled and reinstalled again but still the same issue is occurring. Please try to fix it.,1
"Problems with posts loading since last update, also app not showing photos from my photo library when trying to post.",1
I do not have access to my full gallery to make a post. Not to mention all of the excessive posts shown to me from accounts I don't even follow.,1

Lagging in my 6 gb ram phone Google yt Short are much more better that this.,1
Algorithm doesn't work. my media page @cainemedia gets no engagement with Dailly posts anymore posting fresh content with trending audios. tried to get help from Instagram no response...,1
Advertisements are out of control. They take over the whole newsfeed. I can't see new posts half the time unless I scroll thru a bunch of unwanted junk first üò°,1
Far far too many advertisements and the number of recommendations has led me to delete the app on a regular basis. One day it will be final,1
"So many bugs there instead of creating groups its not working and then show that group but not sending any msg or reel , so many bugs in this update , solve it fast.",1
App wants an update without description of changes or fixes. Updates are forced sometimes. Reviews are removed periodically.,1
"The glitches seem to have no end! The camera starts working in background while I'm chatting, and as soon as a press back the camera opens. The music from reels randomly start playing while chatting, and if I open someone's account from the texts I'm being able to see all chat threads in between the posts, where the comments and captions are. Also, it is so hard to find the tags I'm actually looking for since the ones showing up in search are (I'm assuming) the most used/popular.",1
"PLEASE FIX THIS!! For weeks I have tried to get into the app and all it does is show a black screen where the login should show up!! I have to use the WEB app and nobody wants to willingly do that!! I text a lot of my family on there and now I'm having issues with not replying because no one is going to remember to check a whole web app repeatedly. A lot of other people are saying they're having the same issue and nothing is being done about it, I'm so close to just giving up on this app.",1
Instagram is getting worst now a days i am litreally not able to open msgs of my friends whenever i try to open them black screen apper and it says unfortunately instagram is stop working thats so freakin annoying hopeeeee that they will fix this annoying issue,1
"It used to be better, a lot better... Now it is just full of bugs, I can't post videos and photos with a caption, only without the caption, on my one account can't see notifications and I can't change bio or profile picture. I have to admit that this app has become a place for bugs... There's a lot of bugs... A lot and I hate it, I do... This app is garbage right now and I hope they fix it as soon as possible, this is no lie, I'm dissapointed in this app, VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY Dissapointed!",1
"Used to be great but recently it crashes all the time and today my follower count is just stuck, doesn't go up or down. Such a shame",1
Sorry for the one star ‚≠ê I can't able to update messenger... And there is lots of bug in this app ...,1
"So slow. I have a brand new phone with Android 12, and the app is so slow; stories won't load, posts won't load, images won't post or take forever to post. Then my friend who has an iPhone 7 has a quicker, smoother, and better overall experience than I do. Tried looking for updates to the software or to my phone's software to no avail. It is not an internet issue either.",1
message not showing bug .. kindly fix it ASAP,1
I liked using the app but not after they disabled and deleted my account without any reasoning.,1
My feed isn't refreshing after the update. Please help instagramü•≤,1
Instagram is not working nowadays. I keep on opening it and it just shutdown. Please fix the underlying issue.,1
One of my accounts is updated but when log in to another account the updates are not the I can't reply to someone's particular replies individually like I can in the other account and I can't react to their texts with emojis expect the default heart one,1
App behaves differently day to day. Right now I'm getting 1-2 posts per refresh. Probably a Facebook behavioral experiment which I do not appreciate.,1
"Reels just disappeared. Then music seems to have lost artists and is only showing unknown, almost royalty free music. The text over videos either disappears, goes squished, looses its colour or moves somewhere else.... text from a post just deletes itself if you scroll back to look at the video before posting. Sometimes the preview video is upside down... there are so many glitches in instagram at the moment I don't even know where to begin!!",1
I am using insta since 2 years but I am not getting many features like i can't react with different emojis to someone's messages and even i am not getting the notes option.,1
"I didn't post much things on Instagram, why you want to shadowbabned me? I think y'all better shut this Instagram down! üò°ü§¨",1
App logs me out just about every other day & forces me to change my password. The app logged me out yesterday & now it won't even let me log back in. It only gives me a login error üòí,1
"Idk if u can even help me here , my two account got suspended for no reason The other one is my art acc that literally has nothing but my drawings and the other is just an acc with nothing in it. I dont wanna lose my art acc for some nonsense reasons i worked so hard for it Whats wrong w yall",1
Worst application reels freezing during middle and messanger option is unavailable plz do something üò£üò©,1
"The new update made it a lot less user friendly. The most used features (add photo, see likes,...) are moved to the top corner. While the least used (reels, shop,..) are moved to the bottom, being very prominent. Also it doesn't save drafts anymore. Seriously don't get the new update! Please change it back!!",1
"Weird issue happening again. Ive got two account on the app and what is so confusing is that each of the two accounts provides different function of the app. For example, when I open the camera, each of the two accounts have different layout and camera function (and the camera and story editing function of one of the account is very advanced and helpful and i really like it). Ive tried logging out / clearing cahces / reinstalling the app but again NOTHING WORKS!",1
Posting some post or reels take longer time then expected. Worst experience,1
"Bad app. Very frustrating. After 9 years, cant login to my account anymore. It says login error",1
"I uninstalled Instagram for some reason, upon reinstalling I can't login into the app as it goes black everytime I open it. I've tried reinstalling a few times but to no avail. It's been more than a month since I've reported this issue, I've also come across a lot of others facing similar issues but their hasn't been any improvement in the app so far. With each update I hope of the matter being resolved but no action has been taken by the developer's side. THIS APP IS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.",1
"After i update the apk, instagram explore is not the appearance of instagram is not to my liking, it is not in accordance with the following update, instagram photos are full of pictures of landscapes and animals, not to my liking, very boring, please fix it",1
"i keep updating the apps but i didn't get some of the new features. i have the nametag one, but didn't get any filter/superzoom etc. i also unable to post stories. it keeps saying 'error'. only 1 out of 10 stories got posted. i've tried logout-login, restarting my phone, uninstall-reinstall but none of it work. it used to work without problem but after a few updates ago it stops working properly.",1
Iam not getting telugu songs in the music library please check it because it's getting like searching for long time and iam getting any music and everything is good but only music and getting only English and your not replying for anything,1
I love Instagram but recently it seems so messed up. Different people getting different features at different times and it is also so so glitchy. I was having some serious problems with editing a reel today so uninstalled and reinstalled the app to see if that helped and now the reels feature has disappeared. I can't see me old ones or make new ones. Sort it out Instagram!,1
"It doest give best service ...I forgot my account password,i was tring many times but i didnt get the proper solution my identity also rejected many time....also they will not acess with email......with all those thing I completely unhappy",1

I am dissapointed! It doesn't give me an option to share story when somebody mention myself in it.,1
"Rubbish, it keeps glitching when I try to post a reel. Highly frustrating and disappointing!",1
They are not help support response. My insta have lots of bugs.,1
How in the f they still has 4 star review? This update make everything useless. Actualy worst than any other app. Merging with facebook really is something they shouldn't do Edit: now i can't even upload a link in my story lol. Everyday we get more bugs from this app,1
"It's already 4 days my Instagram app can't be used properly like before! This is first time having a bad experience with this app!!! When I opened the app, it only stay blank (not showing any pictures/videos). even I tried to refresh, the app loading went super slow but it's not work at all & still showing nothing! I already uninstalled & installed the app again but still useless. Please, fix this ASAP!!! It's really make me frustrating!!",1
"App keeps crashing. Already uninstalled/installed, cleared cache... Can't even see my messages or post anything really.",1
Link is not always responsive in captions that's very bad...... My link always turns out to be a text after posting it,1
Latest update is terrible for users and creators. Engagement is low. Captions and comments are impossible to navigate even liking a post has to be right over the picture. Scrolling is very awkard. The new version seems to be tailored towards video but instagram should to be photo focused. This may be the end if something dosen't change. Find myself spending seconds on here instead of minutes lately.,1
There is reply option also..in Chating conversation not there any emojis please change some features,1
"Recently, keeps crashing...and if you are updating the app...give an option of being able to locate non followers..",1
"I absolutely hate the experience in this app. It crashes every time I try to make a post consisting of several photos. I dunno why it just can't handle it, my screen starts flickering, then turns black, but only on Instagram. The screen works fine if I go to other apps/recent apps, it even shows the bottom bar used to switch between apps while on Instagram with all black screen Just annoying as heck I can't handle it anymore",1
It's not working for past week and please take immediate action and solve the glitch problem,1
Unable to share posts to Instagram friends because on clicking the share button my facebook contacts show up. Stop forcing users to use both Facebook and Instagram together!,1
"From last few days this app continusly irritating by showing unnecesary ads like ocean etc , if you don't take action on that then me and my friends uninstall the your app",1
"It's horrible not been able to see any notification or activities twice. If I click on the heart, I can only see the activity one time. After that, it's impossible. I only can see again if someone mentions me or likes my photos, for example. The feature is probably broken because it's not possible that this is expected.",1
I m not able to reply on messages by highlighting them or select them to reply particularly,1
I am not able to log in. The log in screen thag shows the user id and password is not shown. Only a blank screen. Have tried everything. Please help,1
Keeps force closing when trying to view saved posts,1
If I wanted to make reels I would use tiktok if I wanted to make videos id use YouTube Instagram should have stayed to it's uniqueness a photo app! Stop trying to be other platforms!,1
"New update...new problem. All of a sudden, any pictures I post to my feed become damaged. And the more pictures I try to add to 1 post, the more damage each photo takes. I look at the same photo in my phone's gallery, and there it is, looking beautiful and crystal clear taken from a 48mgp camera. Yet now when uploaded to IG it looks like it was taken with a 10mgp camera. I have done nothing different with my editing nor changed any formatting settings in my editing apps.",1
"instagram follower count is stagnant even though I have new followers, they are not reflected in the total number !? anyone is facing the same issue !!!!???",1
Account got hacked. Some random 100 people got followed without my idea of i followed them when. Even couple of posts are posted from my account and I have no idea how. Instagram is not secure.,1
"I've had it on my phone for about as long as I've had the phone which is like a year but now it just shows a black screen then crashes so now I can't even use it anymore. I've restarted my phone, uninstalled, and reinstalled the app soo many times. pls fix it I haven't been able to use it for almost a week now edit: it's been about 3 months and I still haven't been able to use it",1
This was once an amazing app for showcasing your images and stories. I hate to be that person- but there's some strong correlation in the downfall of this apps services from the point Facebook purchased Instagram. No longer able to post stories and images efficiently. Same goes for sending them via message. They'll only be successful in uploading about 1/5th of the time. Disappointing to see an app head in such a poor direction. Especially after functioning so seemlessly years before..,1
"Stop Changing The Got Dam UI Please For Once Fix Something Important Newest Update broke calls for me, thanks a lot Had to uninstall and reinstall Upon reinstall it was like my Instagram got booted back a few updates despite the fact I cannot update it",1
Stop with the pop up when you open stories. It is very annoying to have to constantly close it.,1
Poor customer service. Non existent actually!! Full of bots and scammers.,1
"the latest update (reels tab instead of the usual cluster explore page) is terrible. if i wanted to watch videos all day, i would go on tiktok. i'm on Instagram for pictures. Most people are. Please give us back the opportunity to scroll through pictures (and no, the recommendation that come up on the homepage after you're fully catched up isn't enough).",1
In this new horrible update My post converted into reel after uploading...i didn't able to post vedio as post...ahhh!! It's so lagging also..Soon solve this problem.,1
"Trash app, constantly crashing while I'm trying to check out insights for analysis of my brand. Fix this, my boss is mad at me because you bastards can't make an app work right.",1
"There is no music ,Notes,etc.. Need to update",1
There are many nudity content in instagram ... they aare disturbing the environment.... there aare many fake accounts .. i have reported 2. 3 accounts which have texted me .. can u do something and remove those account .. and overall instagram is a very good platform .üëåüëå,1
"Always has problems. Slow in loading filter, feed was not updated even with good internet line.",1
"After so many update, I guess the app begins to crash. Filters are not working, you can't post/save videos (continuous videos). It's so annoying. How many times I tried uninstall and install and find any ways to fix it but it always gives me disappoinment. I always update my apps but then, it's really disappointing knowing that this app really has a problem. Hope Instagram Team will recognize this problem and provide solution.",1
Reel saving option sucks after update fix it and bring back older one,1
"I've had my instagram account for a long time now. But I still couldn't use the 'Support a Small Business' sticker feature. I've tried everything. I've reported the problem multiple times. I've also updated my Instagram app every time there's a new update. But still no change, hence, the 1 star review. I hope this gets fixed as soon as possible so I can use this sticker feature for our family's business.",1
"Extremely buggy, the last time it functioned normally was about.... oh wait it never did, there is always that one annoying bug that happens all the time, for example the keyboard is glitches out the stories keep changing sizes randomly and the new reels feature that skips the videos on its own and there's no way to get back to the previous video, there's also the fact that some people are allowed to see the amount of likes and some are not, I don't understand to you want it to private or not?",1
All it does is recommend pages to follow. You cannot see your followers posts anymore as you are bombarded with page recommendations and ads on the home page,1
"I don't know whats going on but I'm having real issues aswell. I can only upload videos as reels now it seems with absolutely terrible quality and resolution. Also I don't even have the option of uninstalling the app, just disable or force stop so I can't even try that. Now my heart notification icon has disappeared.... I've also experienced no captions with posts I'm trying to share. Very frustrating it's been going on for over a week now",1
"The application is not working, please fix your errors",1
It's refused to login my account Even creating a new account is a problem It's frustrating,1
My instagram is not working after the current update. I did re installed for several times but still did not work! Totally a waste,1
"The new update messed up the messaging, especially when you want to send a post to sb, you have to search for them in a list??? Firstly, the list starts with people you've never even spoken to... secondly, it takes ages to load the name, and tbf 90% of the time the name you searched for won't show up at all ... Disappointing really",1
"I have just tried to join Instagram for the first time and am very disappointed. I have spent all afternoon fighting through the signing up process TWICE, encountering issue after issue as the app shut down half way through and eventually wouldn't let me into my account as it had been deactivated without my ever getting past the registering stage. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, leaving it and coming back later, sending feedback and still nothing. I shall not be recommending it.",1
"I am so annoyed, some of my favorite highlights just disappeared from my highlights tab AND THE ARCHIVES! Please me there is a way to retrieve these memories? This is the first trouble I've ever had with the app, but it's sure a BIG one. I mean a feature specifically designed to store and document your precious memories just decides to delete them without any prompt or anything. Kindly fix this asap!",1
"It logs me out every other day for no reason and when I try to log in it just doesn't let me, so I have to uninstall and reinstall the app everytime it logs me out",1
"it's very buggy, it lags really hard when i try to post something (normal post or story), and often just outright crashes. also, please change holding the ""undo"" button while drawing on a story making everything you drew disappear with no way to get it back. it keeps irreversibly deleting what i drew and i have to redo it 4 times, even really simple stick figures. also, even though it has camera permission, it thinks it doesn't have camera permission",1
"Suddenly my instagram not open or login....why its shown 'sorry, there was a problem with your request'. What can i do for login my account....i am trying on another phone also but its not login.",1
It doesn't come with searching text in conversation,1
I don't like this app anymore. Because it doesn't have any proxies for the people who can't connect.In Iran alot of people lost their businesses because of this.please find a solution for that.,1
The all is just keep getting worst by every update and also I'm waiting for Instagram wto give me my pronounce option,1
My account is being updated regularly but I am not able to give reactions to the messages or posts that I am receiving from my friends and I am also not able to know which person is in online n who is not. I am facing this problem since I have created my account I have already reported my problem many times but no one is responding and taking action against my problem So please respond fast üôèüèªüôèüèª,1
I used to like Instagram a lot from the beginning but it has become worse than ever nowadays. The message notifications were not poping up at the right time. It sometimes take 2 minutes for the notification to pop-up and also it even takes an hour at times. Fed up with these notifications delay. Hope they remove this as soon as possible.,1
Why you ppl remove the option of download anyone reels..earlier there was a option now there is no option,1
"It was a good app. But now, it just have gone mad. Why the hell did you introduce reels. It has all just messed up after that. I can't log in to my account once I log out. Posting a story takes forever. You can't switch accounts even after posting the stories because it says "" can't switch accounts while posting stories."" Disappearing videos and photos don't open. Disappearing videos open after a week or more. Please repair these glitches asap!!",1
"My instagram keep stopped working all of a sudden. When i open my instagram, it lasted less than one minute and then it'll stop working, please help me",1
"White screen for the past two weeks already. Man, August is already ending but I can't still use my account. Still showing white screen.",1
"Not able to react on messages,even I uninstall and install again",1
Bad app doesn't working. Also white & black screen problem face. Wroust system in this app. Please Don't open in your Instagram account & don't use in this app.,1
"Block account without no reason,even I am using regular Instagram and suddnly how can remove my profile from Instagram....need justification",1
"Black screen, unable to load/open! Please help asap! 29 Jul - 3 days and no change yet! So laggy dev and support, Meta doesn't care about us anymore?",1
"TOO MANY GLITCHES SUDDENLY So suddenly, my Instagram Music is only showing 10 same songs that too soke random ones from artists I've never heard of. I'm unable to put the songs that I have even used in the past. TRIED SWITCHING ACCOUNT FROM BUSINESS TO CREATOR TO PERSONAL. TRIED UNINSTALLING AND REINSTALLING THE APP. NOTHING WORKS. REPORTED THE ISSUE MANY TIMES BUT NO HELP. I am not even able to see the reels suddenly. The option is gone and it is extremely frustrating specially for creators",1
My insta account is private and i am getting follow request daily but the number remains same its not increasingüòëüòëüòë,1
Bloody app anybody can hack account easily.... No proper securities... And Instagram support system is too slow they don't even help... Just don't create your profile and get hacked like me...,1
"WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THIS APP? EVERYTIME I TRY TO REFRESH THE FEED IT WON'T WORK! I DID EVERYTHING, I CLEAR THE DATA ON SETTINGS AND IT'S UPDATED, BUT IT'S STILL THE SAME? UGH.",1
"I'm getting sick and tired of having to change my password constantly... It's gotten to the point I'll uninstall the app for a few days or permanently, the bugs need to be fixed and it freezes now and again. The option of having to see comments during Instagram lives is annoying, the feature of hiding comments needs to be brought back. Also the updates are pointless it doesn't seem to do much, or when updated it ruins a lot of the features within the app.",1
"The new button layout which replaces the explore page is just awful and an obvious attempt at using people's muscle memory to push the reels feature which is getting ever more penetrant. If I wanted to use Tik Tok, I would download that app instead, but I actually enjoyed Instagram for what it originally was. I used to be able to find likeminded artists and other things I like, now I am drowning in ads and cringeworthy reels that make me want to close the app within seconds.",1
It's getting real difficult to use instagram nowadays. Idk why it skips every story in about 0.01 sec and doesn't let me view someone's story.,1
"Ever since the reels are showing up on the regular timeline the experience is so confusing and it's annoying to scroll. Reels should've stayed in their own tab. I've been wanting to delete Instagram for a while, because it gets less and less user friendly... so now it's about time!",1
"Honestly... One star is one more than Instagram deserves for now. This known issue that makes app crash EVERY SINGLE TIME I try to post a story is so annoying and frustrating. It didn't post my story, and did not allow me to delete. There are a lot o people telling the same history, there are couple of sites talking about it, and the bug remains in the last update. Please, Fix it!",1
"My Instagram is not working since 12 July as when I open my insta it shows black screen. I have done everything possible including check the connection, reboot phn install and uninstall the app clear the cache and storage but it's still the same. In my phone my all other apps are running smoothly so I guess there is not any fault on my end . So please check the bug and fixd it . it's really annoying and frustrating",1
"The new story feature/display is terrible. ""Show all"". Why is that even a feature just show what the people I follow put on their story",1
You know ppl are not okay to enter their personal phone number yet you asked for it. Email is not enough for you? So f annoying.,1
"The version of this app for Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 still does not allow you to react or reply to direct messages. It only allows ""Like""",1
"It's my 2nd time that I need to verify my account, it bother me everytime I'm making comment to the people I followed. You know you need to improve that! And one more thing, why I'm seeing reels that I didn't even follow? Your platform is getting toxic just like they say.",1
"There's a bug now, where if you I try to look at my messages or be on there for 30 seconds it will just crash or say that the app has stopped...",1
Why instagram web is not working? Can't sign up or create a business page. What is going on? And no updates regarding these issues.,1

"Genuinely don't like it, it's buggy. The story features don't work properly. It crashes too frequently. I've had it for 2 years with no problems but recently more problems have came up. There's weird updates which just change the experience and the functionality of the app.",1

App is crashing as soon as I open it. 9/22. Also my ADD YOURS function is not working. Please fix and restore ADD YOURS to some users.,1
The app should not be used for younger children or younger adults I see a lot of people posting stuff they shouldn't I see people calling each other layers and it's just uncalled fore .,1
"This is so annoying, I reported an issue with instagram, twice! And even e-mailed them and nothing has happened. They haven't even replied! I am unable to make reels on my app, it always shows something went wrong, no updates are available. I am sick of this problem. I run a business and this app's algorithm already sucks, still reels a little way of making a mark and increasing my page's reach....and now that too is not working. Never expected this!!!",1
It works great but my Instagram does not have filters,1
The app is constantly freezing on videos and pictures and I have to close the app and reopen it to get anything to work after. I've also noticed they've taken away the ability to share other people's stories (which is really stupid). I have a Samsung and my friends with iPhones can still share other people's stories.,1
"After the new update, It won't allow me to add location either in the stories or posts although the location is switched on. It lags like forever and the image qualities decreases (pixelated) alot whenever I post them as a story or upload them as a feed although the picture is of a high quality and doesn't look close to the picture that shows up to me. And I hate the fact that it crops the photo I need to upload. I always have to use a ""no crop"" app to be able to upload the full picture.",1
"Stop trying to bed every other app. I have it to keep in the loop with friend and family, not buy gimmicks. You are ruining another good thing.",1
"From the beginning it was a very good app. Then came ads, Influencers, algorithms, paid posts, and nothing interesting left",1
"I hate instagram its so bad and they dont have good support and they are constintly wanting to be tik tok ,overall a pretty bad app,the worst app you could download actually ,touching grass is much better than downloading this app",1
App has been incredibly glitchy for months. The wrong photos upload and photos get distorted.,1
"A star because there is an outstanding error when trying to post multiple photos. They duplicate and would never let you go back to the original photo, but you have to start from the beginning. It is very annoying. I uninstalled the app, restarted the phone but keeps doing the same for a few month already. Hope it will be fixed soon!!!",1
"Horrible app that gathers your information, follows your eye movement and steals your attention. What made me very angry, that Stories of smart people are shown 2 times shorter, than from stupid people. Every time there is not main stream media - Instagram shadow blocks people, users, stories and posts. Hope Instagram will close in coming future or treats all users respectful. For now it's a horrible app that blocks information and spies on you.",1

Ui is unusable and always glitches in some way, i get my acc threatened and have 0 way to clarify i was talking about a sport (boxing) and not murder, it depicts me as a toxic person but i did nothing wrong and when i appeal i dont get to write anything to clarify? Thats not your community guidelines!!! I didnt breach anything..... @Indigo_silhouette_",1
My Instagram account couldn't refresh so many bugs so many glitches in my account doesn't work properly,1
"I used to have almost no issues until the latest update. Now the app is horrible at DMs. If my internet connection becomes a bit weak(not disconnected,just weaker than normal), I have to wait 3-4 minutes for the message to be delivered. Not just that, sometimes after refreshing, the app deletes a few recent recieved messages and unsends a bunch messages that were sent. Having a really hard time with this.",1
Not working quick and I selected video one play some video,1
I got logged out of my account and I tried to log back in however when I open the app it is just a black screen. Nothing will show to let me log in.,1
"Great app in general, but also the buggiest app on my device. The chat is unusable, messages often aren't arriving or getting sent. Removed notifications are coming back. Empty notifications showing up. UI isn't always clear either and more ads everywhere. Update 2020/4/16: Since almost a year I can only rarely open the app without crashing right away. Sometimes it crashes several times a day in the background. And all this on a couple years old HTC with Android 8, sad...",1
"Incredibly glitchy for such a basic app. All you can do is post short videos and pictures, and half the time that doesn't work. I frequently have problems with videos. Video black when you watch it, it turns out that happens when you tag someone in the video. Pretty shameful for 2020",1
It's doesn't not work properly and when ever I want drag tha msg the other person sent and I cannot forward it by dragging üò° its not working properly and want to download the reels it doest support,1
"Riddled with frequent issues. Comments often fail to load, or have significant threading issues and bugs. UI is inconsistent. No playback controls on short content. No ability to zoom on images, pinch to zoom springs back. Some content (particularly videos) is extremely low quality. The same video posted to YouTube and IGTV and the difference is might and day. An poor experience all round.",1
Quietly sensors accounts and removed ability to save photos or videos,1
I can't react a message. And not upadet messager.. Please solve this problem is very important for me,1
The app has suddenly stopped working in between. Reels and stories get stuck despite a good internet connection.,1
"I cannot upload videos to story. Pictures are fine but videos will not upload. I have reinstalled the app, emptied cache and data. This has been a problem for months ever since I opened a second account on the same phone (this account has since been removed). No connection problems, tried on 4G and wifi. I can't get any answers online because usually the problem is with uploading video to feed, which I can do without trouble last time I checked.",1
"when I try to most multiple photos at once with filters applied, the first image is superimposed onto all the rest thus running them. Edits you make to drafts don't apply. Videos lag when trying to upload them. The amount of bugs in the photo uploading side of this app is unbelievable, especially considering these features used to work fine some 2 years ago. Each update has made these bugs progressively worse instead of better.",1
"this is the worst app i've used so far. first time used and it turn out well but the updated seems to make it worse. it keep lagging. when i want to edit video, and i'd like a preview , the reels did not appear as what i want, it will turn into a whole green screen. there's also problem about my story, feeds and search page, this app takes up a lot of storage, so please make it worth.",1
"I normally don't write reviews but recently I've had it with Instagram's bad customer support and overall bad experience. I live in Canada and I want to use the music option for my stories but for some reason, I can't use it. I even sent a mail to Instagram to fix this issue but they didn't send me any replies. Most of my friends are able to use this option but I can't. Please respond this time around. I have sent my mail like a month ago.",1
Constantly crashes. And ad after ad. This went downhill over the years with bots and advertising and spam and fake sex bot accounts.. So much for improvement. LMAO,1
"Insta used to be better, too much like tik tok now. Bring back chronological order of followed users. No more suggested users in feed. Cheers",1
"The leg booth is more, the message is not shown.",1
Has more ads when I view stories and it's irritating,1
"Stop muting my reels when you have the audio up yourself on your platform and millions of people are using it but only my reel is muted, either make it an option to edit the audio or something",1
Lately the app is not functioning properly.,1
"Apparently I have been missing out on all the updates. I can't reshare stories, I can't add music to stories, i can't create reals. I can't even update the app. I have unistalled the app and put it back but absolutely no change. Disappointed. I use this for personal and professional reasons. Kindly assist.",1
Hello Instagram team . As a I am Instagram user from 5 years with 4 thousand followers . I am facing a problem I Am unable to send massages to All the Accounts Plz help me out as soon as possible Thank you,1
With every update comes something that nobody asked for. I don't care for suggestions after i finished scrolling through my timeline. I don't give a *bleep* about seeing a big Reels window on the top of the search feed. It was bad enough seeing the same videos that i can't prevent from seeing again to the point I had to actually block the accounts. Time to go back to a timeline by the latest post. It is Oct 11 and I am seeing posts from Sept 28. That is ridiculous.,1
"Terrible on Android! I've had several flagship android phones and I've always had a terrible experience with instagram on my phone. Posting photos and videos on my story or on my feed makes the photos/videos super low quality. I basically can't post video on my story because it's basically a blurry indistinguishable mess once it's up, keep in mind my camera is excellent. I have to use my old iPhone SE to post something to my feed to get a little bit extra quality to my photos..",1
"I cannot run videos on the app one or two weeks after installing it. I have tried reinstalling it for a number of times to solve the problem, but same thing happens every damn time. It pisses me off to uninstall the installed app and then download and reinstall the same thing again and again. I think the best option would be to permanently delete this app from my phone.",1
"I've been using Instagram for two long . And I'm used to uninstall the app from time to time when I need days off . This time , I tried to reinstall the app but I had a blank screen , I couldn't log in. I tried deleting data , reinstalling insta and switching off my phone for several times but nothing happened. I can't log in right now. Please find a solution.",1
"I've got an error code popping up while using the app, so I reinstalled it. And now I've lost highlights section and stories archive. And I also can't publish neither a post nor a story. There are also some features not working but I never used them before that much, I just post artworks. If it's a new update then it made the use of IG even more uncomfortable and terrible! I really loved this app and I'd like to keep using it but after these happenings it's making me change my mind.",1
"Everything about this app is glitchy: the ads, reels editor, account connection to Facebook, and many more. It's designed to make you stay on the app as long as possible even if it means giving you problems and errors. I wish there will be another app like this soon. This is the perfect time for someone to swoop in and make a better app.",1
Why again and again it suddenly stop working.... Every day facing the same problem.. it is not working. When this problem will fix . Is Instagram giving punishment of having an account on this platform?,1
Its really hangs alot while posting reels more tha 30 min,1
"I have been experiencing a black screen when I open the app. All i see is my profile pic on the top left corner and bottom right corner. I can't see any posts or any stories. Nothing refreshes, my messages are gone, It happened randomly from one day to the next. I've tried clearing cache, clearing data, uninstalling downloading it again, password change...NOTHING works. Idk what else to do. I have a Samsung galaxy S21 Ultra. Please help.",1
Instagram has continuously worsened after each update. The text on reels either turns upside down or glitchy. The layout keeps changing. The posts become blurry. When I upload pictures to my story they turn into black boxes. It won't show me my DMs. Waste of space honestly. Please fix this. ASAP,1
"the feed is so annoying to scroll now. too many videos and ads, can never find the accounts I'm ACTUALLY following. last update ruined this app :(",1
"Very intrusive app! This app has the mentality of ""everything is shared with the world including third-parties! But, if you got infinite time and patience, you can waste your time daily to constantly reconfigure your settings for mediocre privacy and security"". This app is a resource hog and causes havoc on your mobile system. It always runs background-processes to harvest user data and mobile usage and interactions for the claims of providing better user experiences.",1
"Mark Zuckerberg ki maa di phuddi rand ka bacha daala Everytime new feature comes, i never get that option in first place!! Everyone has that new option but i never get it!! Even if i update it",1
"New accounts gets to have all the new features they refuse to give to older accounts like the one that I made in 2015 that I still use today. I don't have the search feature in chats, neither can I reply to messages or view reels my friends replied to. However my new accounts can. Trying to organize saved posts are also a mess if you have many collections. Whenever I save a new post, it doesn't show the collection I want to put it to, it only shows recently made collections. Fix this, please.",1
"Instagram has always been buggy for me for years. All messages suddenly dissapeared all of a sudden, i want to send pictures to my chat but it doesn't let me scroll at the bottom of my gallery, after i clicked on a picture sent by someone in chats my keyboard would freeze and i couldn't click on any videos or chats or even react to messages anymore not until i left the chat. This recent bug frustated me a lot, i wanted to check my friends stories but it would skip on its own.",1
There's too many glitches and bugs. You need to fix all of that in the chat section there's so bug like there will be only two or three chat's but it show's like twenty message. And sometimes instagram turns to old verison even if i have the latest version work on the bugs than adding more features. Please kindly work on that also make sure that Everyone can use Instagram properly.,1

I don't think what is this, i just didn't like this. I wish I might explain you well with a screenrecord video or with a pic...",1
"I have a problem of savings audio from some of the reels which are official and its becoming a problem as i post reels by using other audios. And if i search for a song while posting a story there are no songs which i search for and is showing ""no result"". Kindly fix is as soon as possible..",1
Get it fixes every update nothing works updates three times in a week,1
"This app has been bugging for months. At first I thought it was my older phone, but even on my brand new phone, the app has horrible glitches with posting content. It'll replace photos, not use the edits, or cut them in half and post them like that. And now I can't even get things to load to edit or even post.",1
"From the past 2 weeks I'm having issues with home page not loading new contents even after refreshing it for many times, here in this case stories are updating but home page content remains the same even after connecting to high speed internet, I hope you will find a solution for this issue ASAP as I'm having a lot of trouble missing my friends and families update..",1
"Sorry, couldn't even rate 2 stars. I have been using this app for almost 2 years but suddenly everything went wrong. Nowadays, I couldn't write any caption in my posts, couldn't tag anyone and even couldn't add location. I have reported a lot many times but nothing worked. Please, look into this matter as soon as possible. I have reinstalled but nothing is working.",1
"This was fine in the beginning and now I'm having problems with my posts, evertime I post something it automatically delete my captions and after that I try to edit it and it doesn't save it, it keeps on telling me to try again and again and again. They need to fix this bug or issue.",1
"Almost every single time I tried to use this app, it just doesn't work like I can't see posts, I can't respond to messages, nothing loads and I can't log out or report the problem. I've tried everything to stop it but it goes back to doing that at least every week or so. I delete the app then reinstall it, that works but only until I close the app. Genuinely don't know what to do Edit: it still does this, still can't report it to fix because it crashed on me",1
"This is so crazy, what is wrong with Instagram? It's been almost 1 week that I cannot see others people photos and stories. Please, can you fix it? Although in my opinion, instragram is way better in the past. Now you added so many things to the app, maybe its carried too many things? Maybe that's why it doesn't work really well. I really hope it will get better soon. Good luck. Again and again why are you logged out from my own account and not letting me sign in bruh üòÉ",1
Really some things of instagram are so frustrating and bad suvh as its feedback s answer just getting one time but when you have technical issue at 2nd time even they reject you and so many tevhnical problems i had face it while using,1
"Worst App Ever! I have tried twice to install and register with this app and both times I have been told I'm breaking so called ""Community Guidelines"" but am never actually told what (if anything) I have supposedly done wrong - despite the fact I verified my mobile number and email address!! Given I only follow people with their pet/ nature/music postings I'm not sure what the problem is! ü§î I give up - I'll carry on using Twitter!! Not wasting any more time on this app!!",1
"High time to fix the crazy amount of bugs, i try using a filter and the whole app closes, some of my saved filters are disappearing on their own and when i try to search them up and use them, it says unable to use. It's getting tiring now really, just fix it",1
"I've been having trouble with the app for weeks. It literally wouldn't let me post, it always glitched out and returned me to the home page.

"I enjoy the stories, I enjoy seeing my friends & family on instagram. I have been reading the last couple of reviews from others. And I know that I will not be downloading this APP til you get the Bugs out. I have enough anxiety in my life, I don't need more.

"The app is good for communication and keeping touch with old friends. But instagram is all about taking nice pictures with a good camers of its interface. Been facing camera issue long back and they haven't fixed it yet. I am quite upset on them for that. Insta crew, pls look into it. Asap.",1

Full of bugs like: ‚Ä¢ photos and videos reappear after some time even if ive seen them ‚Ä¢ sometimes the app just freezes while in feed and i have to close the app and reopen it and its annoying ‚Ä¢ stories reappear even if ive seen them ‚Ä¢the version i have is the same in every device i own and the features differ from device to device ‚Ä¢ when someone calls me the call stays as an active notification even if the call has ended There are more minor bugs but these are the most major ones,1
such an anoying application. i open the app and see some posts then almost immediately the posts dissapear and it says I am caught up. I would have to click see old posts to see everything I missed which basically quadruples the ads. The suggestions are horrid and never anything that would interest me. The feed and people who use this .. many of them just spam stupid text images with bad life advise. Can't scroll through that shite fast enough. I just want to see images. videos .. hate em,1
"Crashing, glitching, doesn't upload anything, and it's the app as it's the same time consuming on any device and im a content creator that somehow can't upload anything also doesn't appear, uses a ridiculous amount of time, data, and storage and overloads any phone/PC phone internal storage regardless of SD size. Defective & obsolete app, such a pity for a popular choice",1

Come on.",1

I had to put my phone on safemode to make sure it wasn't my phone dying on me. Nope! All I had to do was uninstall Instagram and everything was solved. This app has literal malware",1

Instagram have fallen from its grace. It's so bad that i have to reinstall back just to fix the problem. The feed keeps loading nonstop despite me having great internet connection and I'm using fricking 5g connection. It's so annoying having to deal with this problem every now and then. I hope you could do something to fix this problem.,1

"App has become absolute trash . I rarely see the stuff I want to see , every third post is an add that is totally irrelevant to me , my explore page is a disaster filled with stupid videos (that I have marked as not interested many times). To make it worse reels are now on my main feed which is just brilliant from Instagram. The app I used to share my artworks barely shows anything I post to my followers. It's quite simple engage with cringe and post cringe to pop out",1
"Lots of bugs recently. The app keeps freezing, blackouts and force closing. I have to clear the data and sign in again. I have to uninstall it from my s22 ultra as it freezes my phone, apparently never have experienced such a situation with my phone before. I hope this is fixed soon.",1
"Udate: This new version is total waste of time. Super slow, not fully loading etc. Had to change my review also because you get ZERO help/assistance from Instagram. Old review: I love Instagram. It's my place to express. I like taking photos and videos and make them into reels post etc. Only 4‚≠êÔ∏è because I would expect higher follow/like rate but I guess algorithm doesn't like nature movies üòé",1
"This app is horrible. All three of my accounts were suspended this morning for no reason whatsoever. Two of them I haven't used in months, one in a few weeks. There's absolutely nothing that I've done that could have gone against the community guidelines because I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING. When I tried to send in an appeal, I was met with a loading screen for 20 minutes before I gave up and uninstalled the app from my device. Also, there's way too many ads for such a useless app.",1
feed still isn't chronological. also reels are trash,1
"What happened to this app ? It doesn't show new messages, posts like it is offline or something while my internet is perfectly fine. It has happened 5-10 times each time i had to unistall and reinstall it even after reinstalling for least hours it doesn't show any jew content and keeps showing old content, doesn't show any messages while icon shows many messages, chats doesn't show etc etc etc. Fix it otherwise i'm already thinking of quitting it.",1
My app doesn't get logged in. White screen appear when I opened. This makes me get bad impression on this Instagram team. Make sure that clear my isssue,1
So much bugs even sometimes the reels option is missing,1
"Reels needs to get better. There's not an option to report if a filter is broken, only if it has something to do with violence or inappropriate content. ""Green Screen"" doesn't work at all. Reels doesn't let you add your own audio over music playing, it's either music playing or nothing at all. That's why people are still using TikTok. If these issues are resolved, lots of people will stop reposing TikTok on Instagram. Oh Reels is ""new""? Doesn't mean you have to take months to make an improvement",1
"The app is updated regularly yet whenever I try to access the older chat messages , the app stops working. Please fix this ASAP.",1

"There's still no proper security on scammers.

Everyone else is meaningless to them",1
"What can I say, it's Instagram. Evil mafia. They need to stop randomly suppressing hashtags on reels. They need to make the software and their stupid unspoken rules transparent and clear. They need to make it possible to use website links in posts and replies.",1

The new crash feature introduce by Instagram in game changer!,1
This app absolutely refuses to open on my phone. Can't use it. It's just showing a blank white screen when open.,1

IDK if I'm the only one having this issue but pictures and stories won't load and all I get is the buffering symbol. I am connected to wifi that is high speed and if I'm not on wifi I use data and it sometimes loads. I love this app for following multiple medias but I'm considering uninstalling it because it just isn't working. And I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times.,1

"This update of the app ain't showing viewers of the highlight after 24h and it is very annoying and most people have already told you that why it is necessary to watch them. No privacy is affected if you show the viewers list. Also don't add a ""See more"" button to the bios of the user. Although I have a short bio, but it is very annoying to click on the button to see the rest of the bio of someone else. Facebook don't ruin Instagram like what you already did to yourself.",1
The new update has made the app worse... i could not send a proper message or even load my account feed as it was just not connecting to the network when my network connection was at its best... i tried uninstalling and reinstalling back and now i cannot even log into the app . it just brings up a pop up saying error. please try to fix this issue as soon as possible!,1

I try to log in on desktop and am told ""Confirm Your Info on the App."" So I go to the app, but get a ""Couldn't refresh feed"" error and a black screen. I have to hit the ""back"" button constantly to get out. Got a video selfie option once, which errored out as soon as I finished. Enjoy my video for all the ""def not using your data without consent we promiseü§û"" stuff, Facebook. Several reports later; still nothing.",1
I used to love this app but randomly I tried to open it and it won't it shows instagram logo with meta and than my screen stays white please fix because I really did enjoy instagram I tried to erase and re installed I clear cache but nothing seems to work,1

App hasn't worked in 2 weeks keeps showing a black screen and nothing else. fix your app.,1
"Multiple photos show ""couldnt load image, tap to try again"". Even if I tap it, nothing happens. At first I thought it's my internet connection, I ran speedtest multiple time and my connection is great. I even uninstalled and reinstalled already but the issue persist. I think your server needs to be fixed. App experience is rather very unpleasant now.",1
"whenever i open the app, a black screen pops up instead of the login page. been dealing wit this for a while now and it's annoying",1
I can only put the 15secs story..why i can't put the 30 secs story?..i also update the app,1
Again im giving same rate to this app you need to upgrade this app now im finding difficult to save videos to my gallery the save icone has been disable pls improve this app and solve this glitch even i hope u will understand the promblem,1
"Every time I try to take a photo on my story, regardless if I use a filter or not, all it does it make the clicking noise as if it's taken the photo, but NOTHING. Nothing appears, no photo. I've updated the app, restarted my phone and done everything possible. So stupid!!!!! Hate that unless you have an iPhone, you can barely use Instagram.",1
"i opened a new account and i am facing a lot of problems with this account. first of all, i can't react to messages with specific emojis, i can only like them. i can't select and reply to messages. there is no option to change themes, and i can only see the default black theme. i can't add songs to my stories. moreover, i don't have the option to view reels. i don't know what went wrong, but please fix this. thank you.",1
"I Have been experiencing lots of issues with the app, with receiving dms sending texts, lost all my chats when i reinstalled it, the chats just disappeared, having trouble loading the newsfeed, can receive a notification of the msg but unable to load the msg in the app, this is so annoying and need to be fixed ASAP. I need all my chat conversation as well.",1
Cant open app. Gives black screen even after installing the recent update. Its been about 3 weeks that its unusable.. very disappointed.,1
"Really glitchy, algorithm is ridiculous. I dont show up on the fairly normal hashtags I use so no new people have seen my account in maybe a year. They say Shadow banning isn't real yet there's so much very clear evidence of it. It's ridiculous",1
"Recently i have been facing issues during direct messages, dm are visible after 2-3 days since they were sent",1
I get weirdly accurate ads on the topics that I discussed with my close ones. Being watched for the sake of ads is the worse.,1
Ever since the last update nothing works correctly. I have tried every troubleshooting method there is and it still doesn't work,1
I am sitting near a jio tower but also insta isn't working it's a very poor app this is my humble request don't download this very poor app ü§¨ü§¨ü§ôüñïüñï,1
I have been experiencing the blank screen as well since 29 July! Please can something be done about this seems like a lot of people have this same problem,1
Tbh If I could rate less i would have rate it less than 1 cauz it is mfkn not opening i ain't able to message or do anything like bro whenever I'm opening it it gets me back to my home screen!!,1
"I made an account a few days ago and they started asking for my phone number. If I dont enter it they wont let me use my account. I've tried my phone number but didn't receive a code AT ALL. I""ve tried my sister's and my mom's but still the code wasn't to all of them. Why?",1
"Theyve changed it so that it snaps your scroll movement automatically and you can't turn it off. They're literally forcing you too look at things you don't want to look at, and stopping you from even being able to have the comments etc on your screen because it automatically flicks to the next post. They did this to force you to look at adverts so they can make more money. I really hope this backfires and results in less people using the app / Instagram losing money.",1
I wish I could rate less than zero.I can't post any screenshot and everytime new update but seems nothing new üòëüòë,1
"I hate this update. I don't care if a post is ""91 weeks""--i want to know the date. I also can't see an entire post on my screen. It shows the photo but I can't see the like/comment bar right below. The jerky scroll instead of smooth scrolling through my feed is gross, and the multiple photo format is dumb. the app is practically useless now.",1
App is not working. Tried clearibg cache but still not working. I TRIED TO TROUBLESHOOT and follow the correct procedures but nothing happened.,1
Activity options is not opening from yesterday. It's continuously lagging and not refreshing from last 3 days kindly debug it soon.,1

I am using Instagram from 2 years but in 2 years I have not find any problem but from 4 days onwards I am uploading reels and I was getting restriction. that's why I am not interested if you have cleared this problem In that case I have interest,1
"Report problem is not working properly, workers are simply ü§ß , Instagram has very good üëç",1
"The latesh update is absolutely trash the reels are just stuck at an image but the audio is going on , this is really really frustating",1
I can't get access to my Instagram account because I don't have access to the email and phone number I signed up with... I tried everything.. video selfie.. almost everything... I'm not making another account please may I have my account back,1

Note not coming and very slow and the app is hanging,1
Thank you for all the indian reels spamming. I needed this so bad.,1
I have a very bad experience in Instagram...... I can't login because of white screen problem.... When I open Instagram app I can only see white screen no other options I can seee .... So I am rating Instagram 1 starüíîüôÇ,1
"What the fu## Instagram doing even i am not able to see comments?? Report also not help?? I don't know what developers doing right now, Fix it as soon as possible",1
"i am going to quit this app i swear üíÄ my texts cannot send, being only able to send pictures from my gallery and the in app camera. this has been happening for MONTHS and i cant believe ive been able to deal with it for this long. the way im communicated with my friends is literally by sending screenshots of the unsent texts. i have been getting notifications and not seeing them in my inbox, needing to refresh at least 10 times. messages ive seen and read are showing up as new ones. fix ur app.",1
"since the last update half the time I try to upload a picture from the gallery in the stories it shows up completely black, at first only when I tried to put a location on it, now regardless of that. Also most of the time the engagement page doesn't load and I can't see my new likes, comments and followers list. On top of all of that I'm getting multiple notifications of the stories I have alerts on: after I click on it and watch the story I keep getting notifications for it throughout the day",1
"Hello instagram team, I can't post my instagram posts and reels please solve the problem. Thank you.",1
There is not proper way for deactivate my so many acounts.need delete option simply.i want only one account.today it's not work it mean instgram ending time start.and one more thing is that there are lots of error...not working stupid app,1
"update: 2 months later i still can't upload more than one piece of media in one post. original post - still haven't fixed this weird glitch i've had for weeks now. i can't post more than one picture at a time because they all randomly become the same picture. you can have 5 different pics but suddenly they'll all become the first one. then if you click on the fourth, they all become that picture. really annoying and i don't know why it's happening",1
What the heck with this app! It's just showing the blank white screen... I uninstalled and reinstalled it.. But facing the same issue again!... Please help asap:/,1
"Something missing on instagram . Like, when you are uploading the post there is no option for music addition. This is very bad",1
"It's locked me out! The ""certifying code"" claims it sent a code i don't get any messages",1
I'm unable to use my Instagram I'm not able to refresh news feed and messeges,1
"Started to use this app just because I liked the idea of sharing photos and videos but really quickly became addicted .

"Baised report system...... always ignore real thing says that ""due to high volume of report we couldn't check it "" but works well against me",1
"My account @sneakerhead.london was deactivated by mistake. I'm a sneaker collector/reseller and instagram was my main communication with other sneaker buffs and now I have lost everything I worked so hard for. Please instagram, if you see this can you restore my account.",1
1star just bcz of their recent layout change. I don't know what they want to with it. Developing team from Facebook is just destroying this once awsome app. Just recently the reel button has been shifted to the middle and after that i am unable to find the button to upload pictures üò°. It's not on the top corner of the profile either... Solve it instagram,1
New update is total rubbish! No need to be like every other app. Why the need to have them all the same?? I liked Insta because it was different!!! Plus it's buggy to bits. Can't even upload anything without it freezing and crashing. Tried to delete and reinstall but it's till the same. Old version was way better!,1
I was hacked on both insta and Facebook on my business account. FB shut down my personal page and now I can't get on my business FB page because they are linked. I have been trying for over a month to recover it but have had no luck doing everything you have suggested. I have spent hundreds of dollars boosting business posts and this is very disheartening that I was so easily hacked then my account shut down.,1
This app has become hot garbage. I can't even open it anymore without the app crashing. And the algorithm has gotten attrocious,1
"Horrible new interface, makes me close the app right after i open it. I'm seeing more ads and recommended content than posts from the people I follow. Also the fullscreen format is claustrophobic and seems cluttered. All the videos autoplay with sound ON! Been using this app for some years now, mainly for photographs. If the next update doesn't give an option to revert to the original, clean and efficient UI, I'll uninstall it. If I wanted tiktok... but I DON'T!",1
"Been updating and updating my Instagram hoping that my new update will have the 'tap here' sticker, but still doesn't have one! How do you fix this?",1
I don't have the add note feature and I have already updated my app.. please help,1
Why the hell you people keep changing the story settings.. earliear we can upload a story of 1miniuts or more and it cuts in 4-5stiries but now their is no option to upload 1minuet story.. U people just making this app worst ...,1
"First the app was good, easy to use but now it's very complex,bugy and often say couldn't refresh and feed while logging out",1
App is super buggy. Doesn't work like it used to.,1
None existant support. I've been trying for several days to have an issue resolved without any luck or support. All the while I'm getting added to BS groupchats and spam comments are all the rage.,1
So many bugs and also removing my stickers I'm not able to story any story in my ways,1
"Cannot see my stories anymore. I have cleared the caches, installed and reinstalled the app, I have updated time and date. I have done everything possible and my stories disappear, other people can see them, but not me. It was working perfectly fine, since yesterday I am having this problem and its really annoying. Fix this please.",1
There is no all songs found when i download this app after unistall,1
"The most broken app I have ever tried. Literally gave an error in the first 2 min while setting up. Unable to update username, suspicious activity (?!?) after profile picture change, not sending verification code, ""something went wrong"" message every few seconds. I spent more than an hour trying to find a solution and make it work without success.",1
"Msg not seen , there is a insta glitch on the another user , late msg recieve to the user",1
"Its a very dangerous app because of its activity status problem ..when I drop out Instagram then also its showing my online activeness , so its a very big problem for every user even my relationship is comes in danger so please maintain it quickly well please.",1
Videos just fail to play. I hear audio but have to click open to reel player to view. Pixel 6. Just installed the app. Do you care?,1
"I'm not able to tap a msg and reply to the perticular msg,,it's irritating really",1
Had a data breach on this app. Garbage. Did not enter information to any app,1
This app constantly crashes the censorship is way too high there are a lot of fake accounts this is worse than Facebook,1
This app is not the same. I do not like the reels and want the photo usage back. I am also sick of my videos being blocked.,1
This has really been a good app but for some work I had uninstalled it and not while I have installed this again this doesn't open!! Fix this problem asap,1
Please fix this glitch asap. My feed is just a black screen! I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling doesnt work!,1
What happen with this instagram app?? Couldn't appear so i couldn't see anything and can not do login to my account on the page all turn white! Fix it please !,1
Does not consistently work. It's stops loading anything after using after one use. I have to Uninstall and reinstall if I want to see anything,1
"I cannot view any photos , videos and my day it keeps on loading . I tried to reinstall and install again but still the same . I thought its because of my internet connection . So I tried using wifi and data but still the same . Other apps are working fine . Idk what to do anymore , this is annoying ! See some comments here having the same issue , please work on this !,and also And now , they also removed the multi - capture option they are just prioritizing on reels.",1
after recent update using it has became disaster...app keep stopping...app hangs while watching reels...in chat reply to particular chat is not working also adding reactions to a msg in chat is missing....prblm nw getting worst...app keeps on stopping...really frustating,1
Used to be a good app but now when I try and open it it's a blank screen it's been like this for days I have tried restarting the phone uninstalling and reinstalling the app and nothing works,1
Have not being able to open the app in months! Installed it and Uninstall it multiple time still not being able to open it. MONTHS!!!,1
This application is not working properly all I can see is a white screen I have tried all possible way but still haven't got the output.,1
App often just hangs after sharing on a story so one cannot go back to any other view in app. After posting several times to a story app gets extremly slow. But most of all it became super difficult to get followers. If you do not have many followers from recent years then you almost have no chance to get through. Algorithm should work on percentage numbers and not in absolute numbers to let you grow. I want to quit Insta.,1
"Idk what is happening with my instagram after i updated all of my reactions and that reply thing is not working and its continuously closes the app ""insta is not working"" do something asap!",1
App is getting stuck not able to message or send pics or vedios resolve it,1
"I tried to recover my acount, and it's already ready to be recovered but it always says ""try again later"" and ""error"". Please resolve this, I have a lot of memories in my Instagram.",1
App was good in the beginning but now it keeps on crashing down. I've been trying to for a month or so to post my vacation pics. But it's uselessüëé. I even tried to uninstall & than reinstalled it again. I've tried updating it too but still the same.,1
"Not even worth of a single Star too. So many glitches! I've been trying to deactivate my account for a while, but it's not happening. It's an Application full of errors and bugs. Moreover it's addictive. Id rather delete my account instead of deactivating. üöÆüö©",1
"completely buggy. i can't view people's stories or even view the posts on my own account. it just keeps saying ""couldn't refresh feed"". unbelievably annoying, ive tried reinstalling, refreshing and rebooting the app but nothing works. been having these issues for a couple days now. makes the app completely unusable. ridiculous.",1
I have never got a single notification even though all of them are put on alert but still no notifs. This is so annoying,1
"Have been trying to add money for promotions. It constantly keep running into problems. Tried to add a video but it is always oversized. There is no way to bring the actual size of the video into the frame. After spending 1 hour on trying to add one video, extremely disappointed with the Instagram technology team",1
Really need apps to get over hyper editing language,1
Your qr code scanning features not working properly as soon as I click camera option whole app just closes and says your app not working properly fix it fast,1
It's one problem after another. Now multiple photos posts are distorted and pixelated.,1
"Right now i m too totally disappoint with the error of instagram app i use to open it but always it open with black screeen , i have tried all possible things to open it but all are failed .",1
"All I get is a white blank page. Yes, I've tried a reinstall. Yes, i restarted my phone.. And yes, I cleared the data. üòë",1
"A couple of things, For some reason it went from 60sec stories back to it being cut down in segments idk who decided that was a good idea... Second: I'm in the creator program to make money off my reels or something but my threads all of a sudden aren't showing up in any hashtags I use. Have I been shadowbanned?",1
I'm having trouble logging in... I'm not able to add account or open the login page.. it's blank... Pls fix this .. i reinstalled and now I'm not able to open any account,1
"I could not open Instagram since 1 week, whenever I try to open it the screen gets white and nothing shows in it please fix t as soon as possible.",1
"App opens but presented with blank screen. Only happened when I tried to log out of my account and log back in. Tried everything, app won't work. Samsung Galaxy A71 5G",1
Lots of bugs on loading photos and trying to log in,1
"Got locked out of my account because of 2FA, there s no means to get a backup code to the email that I ve created the account with or the phone number",1
There is no support for bugs. Moreover if you will report them something about Instagram then they will share a long article about climate change or something. No appropriate answers to reports.,1
I'm not able to text or watch stuff. It closes out by itself everytime I try. It's been like this for almost a year and nothing changed.,1
The app carshes anytime while using so many glitches meta company should fix these,1
I just hate the new feature that instagram added. Why does it take me to the top of a page if i open some old post that is in a deep end of the page. This feature is enough to make me quit insta because this is wasting my time trying to scroll to the last photo i opened. Revert it back as soon as possible. This sucks.,1
"I haven't been able to check my archived stories for at least a week. I've tried updating and logging out of my account, but nothing works.",1
Trash. Absolutely completely trash app. I can't even login to an existing account. Good job at maintaining the app üëé,1
Facing lots of problems like not loading content lacking problem etc,1
Now I can't add music to my story or my reels all of my saved audio music keeps disappearing. Now I can't post videos or reels,1
"I cant view stories, neither I can post them. I cant reply to messages please help.",1
Hh and the same way to go to the same time as well I don't have a good time for the first half of the most common cause I was a great deal 555percent and the same way as 6tight and I have to do it for a while to mention the same way about to get in and around and I was just wondering what is a good day and night and the same time as well as tight budget cuts and the same way about it and I have to the most common cause of your life of your life 9tight to get a chance that I have to do it is the,1
Locked me out of my account. And once I try to log back in its telling me all my I found is invalid help!!!!,1
The app has been working well until today. I'm not being able to make a reel video because either one of the two scenarios plays out whenever I try to do so- 1) The app shows an error message saying that the clip cannot be added without any apparent reason. (I've used the same clip in an old reel) 2) The app crashes. It goes belly up.,1
Swipe reply is not working and i can't even change the themes in chat box.,1
I am having trouble receiving the notifications. It is nog giving notifications and i have already complaint several times. Please respond to it,1
"Instagram is a good app. I like reels We can meet th singers,creckiters, actor's",1
After the latest update the photos that have very good quality will turn into blurry when I put that in my story... What is this.. Useless thing,1
"My account has been temporarily locked for no reason, and I've tried different ways to get my account back , but as far as it seems , there is something wrong with the system which send verification code . I've entered three different emails which I have access to, but the system told me that three of the emails are ""not found"", so...so far I still can't get my account back , hope that someone come and fix this for me , thank you so much !",1
It's trash really run by a bunch of idiots who algorithms are set to be non offensive n protect others right to be or endorse blatant disregard for anothers life while promoting violence with ads and campaigns that push their narrative and not our friends who we get on here for,1
The app is closing itself as soon i am opening Instagram waste version,1
"Nice update. Wonderful now I unable use effects... Super... I don't know if you're given my update, existing features why it is not working.",1
"I have no clue why recently I cannot see anything on my news feed. My internet connection is completely normal and still no photos or reels are being loaded. I feel blind logging into the app although I am using the direct message, but it's very irritating. I thought it was because I was in beta mode, then I canceled beta, deleted and re-downloaded the app, but no, nothing has changed. Please fix immediately!",1
"post notifs and message notifs come in super late or sometimes not at all. i am unable to type messages at the same time when i send posts, i have to send the post then go into the chat and type something in order to type a message. also, when like a post that was shared by a friend, the like goes away and i have to do it multiple times for it to show. somet√≠mes the sound glitches and the audio will still play after the video is ciosed. and reels the dumbest and most annoying thing ever.",1
"the instagram app hasn't opened for me for the past 3 days. usually id report some thing like this in the app itself, but since that's not possible this is the next best thing",1
Not working properly glitch and not opening videos,1
"Consistently disappointing. Updating my review to say it's getting worse. Even with data saver on videos still auto play, not to mention ads every third story. I've just stopped viewing stories altogether. Still informs me when I've posted a photo that I tagged myself in. This app is literal trash being held up by content creators that haven't moved to something else yet.",1
I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times but it only shows a white screen when I try to open the app! Fix this,1
"Really getting laggy, day by day.",1
"I will say worst app. I reported so many times that someone is impersonating me on my old ID which he hacked no idea how, i tried my best to get back my id but failed and that guy is scaming people using my pictures and image but still no actions were taken and i am getting so many complaints. Quiting this app for sure.",1
"1. Instagram story don't display full screen, the top and the bottom of the story post being cut off purposely just to fit for old screen ratio device, so phones with new screen ratio cannot see the content with full screen because there are 2 black bar on top and bottom of the screen chopped off the content. 2. Delay notification for hours and even don't show notification at all.",1
"I've used Instagram since 2012 and it was a great experience. Then Facebook bought it and it's been going downhill from there. I see more ads and sponsored posts than content from people I follow, they force reels (copying tiktok) and the shop feature and it's pretty much impossible to grow your account organically since the algorithm is messed up and the feed isn't in chronological order.",1
"Horrible experience in the last 4 months. Constantly crashes and simultaneously reverts to the old version and new version, I know by the message icon (printer vs fbk messenger icon). Yes, I have uninstalled and reinstalled, I have reset my phone, I made sure phone software version and ig app is always updated. . I have the s22 ultra. I really wish I didn't use the app as much, I would have deleted it and forgotten it long ago. Just like snapchat. Will probably go back to snap now haha.",1
"I can't open the app for months now, even though my phone is not full storage!! These makes me feel so disappointed with this app!!",1
It keeps crashing when I'm attempting to post. Super annoying and time consuming.,1
Instagram is not user friendly. Where there is anti- social things going on that I'd doesnt get ban. But if a person is using for it own purpose thn for no reason. Guidelines any charges are applied. There is No customer service no. Mails are not answered. Nothing. We can just browse by seeing other people posting but we can't post. Nice. üëèüèª,1
"Black screen, cleared cache, reinstalled, restarted phone, nothing works. This is a S21 galaxy phone... It isn't like I'm using some offbrand phone.",1
Lost an account I had for years because of an error message and I can't any support from a multi billion dollar company not even a single live agent you guys are deplorable. Nothing ever works and they're ok with just telling their own users to uninstall and reinstall the app until it works again really I've seen websites from the early 2000's that were more reliable than this garbage app.,1
"I just set up an online shop on IG and tried to run an ad but some type of glitch happened which means they've blocked me from running ads. It's really bad timing because I was going to rely on ads to grow my business. I've sent multiple reports and requests for review with no reply. I read the guidelines inside out and made sure I didn't break and rule + troubleshooted as recommended and as per forums online. Tried disconnecting my FB account, re-connecting business page, uninstall, re-install.",1
"It was a great app. But as I said ""it was"" and now I facing a lot black screen and white screen. Not only in this phone but in other phones also",1
"The new algorithms is bad, The glitch never fix, the notification you put on top right is really not good at all. That ""VIEW OLDER POST"" I can't see my friends or my fav artist post they drown and replace by some suggest post. Don't combined explore and home together it's confusing. The dark mode always glitching sometimes the caption background got white but since I'm in dark mode the words also white I can't read a single damn thing.",1
"The updates usually comes every week, which doesn't make sense as each update rather then correcting a bug, welcomes a new come. The more focus on ads algorithm and addictiveness rather then actually improving app experience is a classic facebook ageda. The bug which i am most frustrated with is getting a direct message notification 2-3 times even after reading it. And it was been faced by my colleagues as well. We have been facing it for around 5-6 months now.",1
"I haven't been able to log on for a few weeks now all I get is a blank page, is there something wrong with the app, if it dosent work soon I will be deleting it",1
"I cant login to my account, I logged out and now when I try to log back in it says: error sorry, there was a problem with your request. Please fix this i dont want to lose my account",1
"This app is embaracing, wonder how it's most common in the world. 1. When choosing pictures/videos from gallery. Why are they ordered by the file edit date and not the internal shooting date ? How come when i just move old photos to a new folder in my phone, they appear first for choosing in insragram. Ao annoying. 2. When trying to post few photos/ videos, it keeps freezing and crashing,and not to mention that once going to background, lot of times it dismisses the already partly edited.",1
Keeps crashing since last night. I can't open the app for more than a few seconds,1
I can't log into my account I can see only white blank screen Please fix this bug soon as possible I try reinstalling/clear cache...everything still not working please fix this,1

On my account I am facing a lot of problemsüò∞ from last 5 days I cannot able to share reels on my Instagram account and other activities Try again later problem is coming on my Instagram account again and again I send report to Instagram community team but they give me no response,1
photos posted are too compressed & blurry.,1
"This app has basically turned into a porn site or for people to advertise their onlyfans accounts, doesn't matter how much I report or block accounts I still see about 75% porn on my feed, it's annoying, deleting my account.",1
"This app was working until, I got restricted on my own account. I can't like, comment or add captions to my post. It is very frustrating. I have reported this issue several times. I just unistalled and I have install again. Please kindly do something about. If it is a bug, pleas fix it. I have never committed any fraudulent action on the app. I never got any warning message at all. please fix this already.",1
White screen. App doesn't work at all anymore üòï update... still junk 2 weeks later. Doesn't work at all,1
In this app reels are not directly open & sticker are not clearly posting,1
"Deactivaded automaticlly in the name of guidelines. Lost all the data, friends and followers.",1
Again this app just continues to suck. It keeps force closing for no apparent reason. Try to reinstalling and it still won't work.,1
It doesn't take update on my phone and when it does the interior part is still same,1
Crashing at it very best Instagram really sucks these days. It's just keeps crashing crashing and just crashing,1

"It's great when the app wants to work. I've been having so many issues lately, from the camera crashing to posts being cut off, and now I can't take videos through the app. Edit: still no updates from Instagram. I've reported my issue twice and tagged them in stories, there is absolutely no support on this platform. It's been a week since my video issue and I've tried everything, the furthest I've taken it was a factory reset on my phone. It's not my phone it's the app.",1

Where is the option for logging in from facebook I created my account. Through facebook and now option is not there,1
The app wont open on my phone after logging out to log in in another account. It's just black screen even after reinstalling. :(,1
"after 3 months of a blank black screen, clearing catche, uninstalling and reinstalling, my instagram finally works again. thank you i guess",1

"so you deleted my other review? that seems shady. worst app ever. doesn't do anything it says it does. takes forever to post anything. lags like a b*tch. I've been waiting 45 minutes for something to post to my story, it posted the third part of a four part video. thanks. the other three parts have yet to upload, although it says it's loading. everything else is connected to Wi-Fi so it should be working. whenever I open Instagram to check it stops my phone completely. lags everything.",1
I've been trying to create account on this app for the past two days but it's writing try again üò≠üò≠üò≠,1
Worst experience. Music is not available in India. I mean I can't add music to my stories or posts. Resolve it soon,1
I can use insta perfectly but I am not able to see anyones profile picture Evan my own,1
Very bad experience because no any response from insta team. My app not open i was many times reinstall update app still not resolved my problem...I am unhappy with Instagram team.,1
Tbh am just fed-up with this app..... How can an organisation like this can make an app look this messup... Everytime i open this app i encounter new bugs n glitches again n again.... Its very irritating....,1
I wanted to use the new version the new update with 60sec story but it doesn't working. Please fix this problem it's not working on Android,1
"I don't get any features no matter how many times I uninstall and reinstall or update. I don't get chat themes, animated story text, reels etc. Please do something about this. I've tried alot and been patient too but this problem just doesn't go away. Edit: this problem is much bigger now, the story feature doesn't work properly now either. Wow, just wow.",1
The app isn't opening only all of sudden. Firstly it was used by unauthorised device on changing password it isn't opening,1
Instagram is very good aap but Aadhar Instagram account cen wibi not send to swipe message bug fixes,1
"Can't believe this app is ran by a multi billion dollar company, I've ran into so many bugs with this app I couldn't even count them (litteraly 100s) I definitely don't recommend downloading this",1
"My friend was posting multiple posts. All sudden she received the ""We'll try again when there's a better connection."" Now, she can't post any picture, upload story (even words), and send any picture in the chats. It has been few days since the bug appear ed. She has tried reinstalling it, the internet connection is great. Her other account works just fine on the same device. This needs to be fixed!",1
"The removal of explore tab from the bottom navigation bar just for the reels is such a pathetic design choice. Reels was already there covering half of the explore. Wasn't that enough? I mean instead of explore, replace the post: [+] tab instead. Move it to the home tab if you want to. Why mess around with something as the search tab?",1
"So manu glitches,so many bugs..it doesn't works smoothly",1
"I can't send reels and my followers are getting less i don't know what is happening after i update it, it's just getting worst plz solve this error it's making me lose interests in this app",1
"I don't know if it's the recent update, but the bugs started to show up much more often in the last 4 days. When i share a story using a photo or video from my gallery (NOT taken in Instagram camera), it just gets shown fully black. Please fix these issues. No need for updates. If it ain't broke don't fix it.",1
"Glitches galore, upside down Reels, features disappear, crashes all the time. Terrible.",1
Very bad app my story showing is revrse don't see music in story seting,1
App had been crashing within a few seconds of using,1
"Been having an issue for the past week or two where nothing loads in the app. Every other app works fine so it's definitely not a WiFi issue. The only way to fix it is to uninstall and reinstall, but the issue comes back after I close the app and reopen it. Saw other people having the same issue too. The app is bugged to the point of no return and it feels like nothing is being done to fix it üíÄüíÄ",1
What the hell how can my Instagram drafts got deleted.. It is very bad please do something I had so many videos on my drafts and now it's gone.. Why they are not responding to my issue don't know so bad,1
"Honestly it's fine but within the past 2 weeks it's been horrible. The camera won't work, or when it does and I take a picture, the whole image is blurred cause it dosent load. I can't send messages nor receive them. If anything, it keeps resending me old texts and it's quite frustrating. I uninstalled, then reinstalled but then my whole instagram changed and nothing was the same or working. I can't change the emoji on liked messages for some reason either with this new update. Why so many bugs?",1
App worked great but one day suddenly videos stopped playing. I tried everything to try to fix it and the problem persists. It's not an issue with my phone as I am perfectly able to play and listen videos when I open Instagram from the web browser. I really hope this problem is soon fixed because it ruins the whole experience.,1
"highlights are glitched, takes long to load",1
I cant login after forgot password and adding new it shows invalid parameter,1
"It's absolutely unusable since the latest update. Every time you scroll past an advertisement, it prompts you to take a survey you have to back out of to continue scrolling. Ads appear every 3-5 posts, so it's a constant hassle.",1
"Everytime they change format, I lose my account on my desktop! I can't access anything and they refuse to fix it so that I can use my desktop!: I don't have a way to connect to my Facebook account and I have done nothing wrong to get this kind of abuse! I'm outraged I keep getting attacked and nothing is done to correct it! You can't contact anyone online because they won't even respond! Infuriating! They need to leave it alone and quit trying to copy TikTok!",1
"There seems to be a new login screen that doesn't let you in when you choose ""don't save my login"", making me uninterested in using this app. What is the point of an app if you cannot even get into it? Sometimes I have to keep uninstalling and re-installing the app to get the previous login screen version.",1
"It's usually a good app and works fine but ever since i've tried logging in on my laptop it keeps on saying ""there was trouble logging you in, please try later"" and this has been going on for days now and its really frustrating. the account gets logged in on the application on my phone but it won't login on the instagram website from my laptop. please fix this its extremely frustrating and a huge waste of time",1
Can't even receive a verification code to my phone. I've checked my spam messages too. Nothing. At this point I am locked out of my account. Honestly it's more of a hindrance than an enjoyable experience. Leaning towards to removing but this is the only social media platform I have because it was simple. Nowadays it's becoming something it's not.,1
Can't install it in my new phone when I click on download it runs smoothly and when it comes to installing it shows can't install this app and got failed. I checked my phone whether there any settings option which is making it to not install but i found that everything is okay In my phone Seems that this glitch is from the developer sideü•± And still using Instagram Lite.. not much better but still I can send and receive messages,1
"What's happening to insta. The app is here for more that 10 years still basic features don't work as they should work, Too many bugs and glitches , first improve user experience then add whatever new feature you want too add. It looks like app is in early development stages.",1
"I'm having multiple issues with insta as if late. I haven't been able to use the ""add yours"" stickers in the stories, I can't add notes to my profile above the conversations, and the app crashes whenever I try to open my saved posts folder in my account.",1
"Instagram is getting worse each week for the past 2 years. This used to be my favorite app and now it's not letting me post videos, app keeps glitching, lots of errors and it's so stressful trying to get it work. Every time new update comes out it makes app worse. JUST STOP UPDATING THE APP. PLEASE",1
This app isn't behaving well since few month i am trying to update my bio since last week but everytime it say something went wrong i change internet connection use fast internet but it never gets updated and also so many glitches in content creation. Fix these glitches. It doesn't seems to be part of such great organization ‚úÖ,1
"I cannot contact instagram support to speak with a real person. The support is really terrible because it's extremely difficult to get in contact with support. You will go through a verification process by taking a video of your face, but even that does not work. Please fix your support!",1
No messaging feature update available. Messaging features like replying to a particular message and replying with emoji are not available and I have reported it many times but no response. I report so many problems on Instagram but no response comes...Bugs and issues are fine but no responsing to the reports isn't.,1
"Absolute nightmare this morning. Tried logging in, it wouldn't let me, sent codes to my phone to log in, everytime I entered the codes, it said codes no longer valid. Uninstalled reinstalled 4 times would not let me gain access to my account... everytime I go to support centre it says unknown error as occurred, what's happening meta... there should be a portal via the Web in order to access your account, especially in these circumstance and the potential that my account as been hacked...",1
"I would give it 1 stars because when i switch accounts, the updates aren't there on my other account. And the posts o share are not in the hashtags i use. It causes trouble and makes me wonder if downloading Instagram was a good decision. I've tried everything but nothing helps. Maybe there are some bugs and they need to get fixed immediately.",1
"My Explore page is full of post I marked as not interested, so half of my page is literally just the crossed out eye. No matter how many times I force close, uninstall and clear all data, I refresh and they all come back. They messed up the algorithm again.",1
"App is starting to work only when it feels like it on my android phone. I've cleared cache, updated it, uninstalled/reinstalled. And STILL having issues loading. The app will not open at all. It works fine on my iPhone. Ridiculous",1
"I don't know what is happening with my account !! I am no longer able to see any posts, any messages , any reel !! Nothing at all !! Please help me !! I had the latest version! I tried to install it multiple times still everytime the same result....nothing available... !! I am no longer seeing any story of anyone !! Everytime it says ,"" something seems wrong , please try again "" !! It's happening since yesterday 17 November!!",1
"The app keeps force closing itself. Restart phone redownload, the app won't stay open. Guess I shouldn't have updated it.",1
My Instagram is not working properly. Everytime I open it'll close the app & show a notification ( app is not working) .,1
Video reel keeps freezing right before it ends,1
It was a great app but now I'm tired of this. Instagram testing my patience level or what. Every next day I'm getting new problems. In the reel section 9/10 reels is showing black screen. Can't see anybody's stories while other apps running perfectly so it's not the internet issue for sure. While want to upload several photos or videos ig automatically cropping photos. It's the worst app now. Please fix those bugs asap.,1
Blank screen is appearing when I open the Instagram.its happening from past 1 month. When are you going to fix this Please fix this problem,1
"This version is lame,even though I updated it I still don't have the notes feature",1
"For the last few days the app isn't working properly It goes blank whenever try to open the app, i installed it many times and even changed wifi and theme settings but that doesn't solve the issue. This is the worst thing that I've ever seen,I installed previous versions, they are working properly but they doesn't have reels and other features. lnstagram sucks these days!!",1
Very irritating most of the times in vanish mode automatically it shows you took a screenshot when i didn't took.,1
Terrible recent update. I can't see any new content for over a week and all I have are #'s and not actual accounts that I follow.I have to click on the Instagram icon and then 'following' to see more and even then it isn't chronological or make any sense.After about 8 posts there's a message from Instagram saying that I have seen all recent posts from the past 3 days! I hope this update is fixed ASAP as I'm being put off from using Instagram.,1
"It's been 1.5 years since the last update of the messenger ...and my account have not yet been updated ...reported the problem quite a multiple of times , but the authority is as careless as they could be ! ...I personally love the app but I hate this kind of treatment from the authorities...if you can then please do fix the problem!!!! I'm sick of reporting and finding ways of fixing this problem. Reach out if you can - @_.sheryllll._",1
Instagram is a joke. The app tells me I have 10 to 15 notifications and when I click it there's none. I tried giving it a chance but I noticed they pick and choose whether they let people see your contents or not. I looked for my ig through my friend's and I can't find it. They're a bunch of haters behind this platform and it's the last time I'll ever install it again. Uninstalling all of my igs. I dont even use them anymore anyways. My life doesn't depend on it so I'll be alright. üíØ,1
"If Instagram is going to FORCE us to post videos as Reels, at least let us post landscape and then rotate the screen to be full screen like YouTube and Facebook does. Back in the day when Instagram only did photos and videos and only showed content in the main feed from accounts you ACTUALLY follow. That was the best Instagram. *I've since deleted my app due to constantly being force-fed reels and content from people I have no interest in following. Just not enjoyable anymore.",1
"After apps update, so many problems occurred. One of it was the background music for videos. It stated that the music is not supported in your country. But some other time, the music is available for the same videos/account that I followed. Hope ig can look into this matter.",1
"So many glichtes so many bugs. My Instagram is not working I cannot send any messages it's just showing sending, I cannot see my post, can't open any reels they are just loading and loading but doesn't open. I cannot log out my id from Instagram it is not showing it's just loading. I have uninstalled Instagram and reinstalled it many times but still I m facing the same issue again n again",1
"Overall not happy with Instagram in the last 2 years. It's very glitchy and difficult to use, I struggle making reels without the app cloaing on me, videos edits not saving, drafts disappearing. Impressions are very low, about 5% of our following sees our posts. What's the point. Oh and we pay for ads.",1
"Too many layers of security. Every now and again it asks for verification of age, phone number, email etc and each one involves a series of passwords captchas etc. One gets fed up by verifying things time and time again. For this reason I've un-installed and move on with life.",1
"Update: Instagram wouldn't let me edit my caption or hashtags and it's controlling the users likes and growing Instagram is not working after the latest update, I can't even open the app, keep crashing and kick me out, I can't edit my caption, I Uninstalled it and reinstalled it again, I cleared cache and restarted my mobile, still it didn't work at all, I reported the problem and sent an email, but it seems like you guys don't care about the users and you did nothing about it.",1
keeps getting worse with each update and it also keeps crashing since 2 days i can't even reply to my messages. if i could i would give it 0 stars,1
"Enjoyed using it till I got hacked last night, they changed the email, phone & added two factor authentication somehow & is now spamming scams on my account & the help section is garbage as it relies on you having access to those accounts for recovery. I've seen these scams before yet the security of the app is questionable if someone can take over it that easily. The video recovery system also doesn't work. Sort it out please",1
"shopping tab is the entire reason I'm rating this app so low, this change adds absolutely nothing to the users ! it only makes it mandatory for everyone to get easier access to ads while removing a much more useful tab to have easy access to(notifications). I use Instagram because I want a social media, not a shopping app !",1
"I have used Instagram for years. But since Nov 5 2022, I can't see any new posts on my feed. I can only see a couple of posts from 3-4 accounts. I unfollowed them and again same thing happens with different accounts. I've tried logging in from other devices. Uninstalling and reinstalling. But nothing is working. I tried contacting their team and reporting this to no avail.",1
"The app isn't working every second day. Doesn't refresh feed, can't see any messages, freezes every second day. Fix it please. First I thought there's something wrong with my phone but then i tried it on my other phone. Still the same.",1
"The only reason I'm giving it one star is because I've been trying to deactivate my account from months but it won't happen. It says"" there was error. Try again later ."" Please fix this!.",1
Instagram is not working it is showing blank screen please fix it,1
"the last update is terrible. I absolutely hate the new layout, the flipping feeling instead of a smooth scroll. Each post takes up my entire phone screen. The things people write on their posts expand up into the picture or video. This often makes it really hard to read and hard on the eyes. Makes dark mode incredibly pointless. 7 thumbs down.",1
"After using it for some time you won't be able to add your favourite song or any specific song that you were searching for the only thing u can get is some useless English songs and you have to select some songs from there only, i updated my app 1000 times , uninstalled it and then install it but still it isn't working, now it is pissing me off so much",1
App has been so glitchy lately. Sometimes you can't upload a reel because the button to upload disappears. Reel music also now stops after 15 seconds where it never used to. Probably to encourage people to make short reels. Definitely not enjoying Instagram anymore.,1
In the last 2 weeks or so I've deleted and downloaded this app almost daily due to it freezing/ not updating and the only thing that has worked is to delete and re-install and maybe get another few hours out of it. Instagram is on the way out by the looks of it,1
"After the recent update I was able to get the reels and story music option but the thing is I can only see the songs recommended by insta in story music and everytime I try to watch a reel, the screen just turns black or freezes. Please fix this issue",1
"The app gets stuck when i upload reels, hence making it difficult to switch accounts. Blank stories from time to time even though i selected a picture. And no, this is not a problem due to storage or me clearing my app cache but the application alone. Please assisst to such problems.",1
"Today I got a pop-up that my account is going to expire, I need to provide email ID and phone number to continue. Once I did it, I was not able to login again. It asked me to create another account by the help of existing facebook account. Now I'm unable to login or retrieve the existing credentials. It's a frustrating experience. P. S. I have not clicked on any melicious link or I'd.",1
"The app glitches so often it's exhausting. I spent about an hour editing a reel only for it to glitch, not post, and be entirely deleted from my account. The draft is gone entire once you attempt to post it, and since my video was a stitch of someone else's reel, I didn't have the option to download it. So I spent about 2 more hours trying to remake the reel only for me to get kicked off from a notification, the draft didn't autosave and now I just have to remake it and pray insta doesn't glitch",1
Constant glitches in recent months. Instagram do not respond to the bug reports that I'm sending. Now I cannot add hashtags or tag people in my captions which is an important feature for my creator page. Yet it works fine on my second account so it's clearly not a device/wifi issue.,1
"Lots of bugs, literally won't let me post anything other than stories which is quite irritating considering I post every day it messes with my work goal in mind for myself. I have sent reports in app and the problem still isn't fixed its not working for me in the matters I need it to. If it keeps up I may have to ditch instagram for awhile until i get made aware that its working properly again...",1
"Recently I'm facing multiple problems like story glitch,reels drafts, posting multiple videos or photos. Whenever I try to post videos or photos it takes a lot of time even I've checked my internet connection, it's good but, the time this app is taking to post some multiple posts is just making me frustrated.",1
"From the day I installed this app I had a lot of problems. Sometimes the home page cannot be scrolled. For some reason it shows the same posts I've already seen. Even the message response doesn't work. I have uninstalled this app twice due to these issues.Again many difficulties came. You suspended my account for no reason and you used some stupid excuses. If you can't take care of it, please don't bother people with it. Because I am totally messed up with this app. I am very disappointed.",1
"Worst app ever, due to technical glitch had to uninstall and install, after installing while logging in again, message is showing saying that my account doesn't exist and I need to create a new one. What about my contacts and pics and reels. Really need to fix the bugs.",1
"Uninstalled the app so I could reduce my social media time, and now there are so many issues with the browser that I have to go back to the app just to get back into my account. The codes take forever to send (over 10 minutes) and I'm just over it. Do better.",1
"short videos fills the screen completely so us with long phones can only view half the video as most of it is CUT off. what imbeciles do the programming? edit: new update is forcing me to ""use"" the music in reels instead of letting me see what the music is and not let me save the song. tefuq is wrong with the devs?",1
I am unable to use add yours on my fan edition samsung. Everyone says to update it (done) to turn it in and off (done) to switch accounts (done) nothing else works. Is this being ovsrlooked?,1
It has been days that It dont allow me to post reels. Its so frustrating.,1
You guys need to do a better job at suggesting your contacts to the platform I mostly see celebrities but not my own contacts a second option to indicate contacts could help instagram please fix this issue,1
"This new version is terrible! Please revert it back to the previous version with spaces between each post. I really dislike the auto video playing and the lack of space between each post. The interphase is not user friendly at all - very difficult to scroll between photos of the same post, instead of it jumping to the next post of another user! Please revert it back to the old version! I'm a fan of instagram, but I do not want to continue using this platform if the interphase is this terrible",1
"Very bad experience I'm unable to upload stories it is showing"" unable to upload "" I have tried many times ,fix this .",1
The app is crashing. I can continue logging in cause it kept coming back to my home screen.,1
My screen keeps going black when I call while on other apps,1
I've reported a problem 2 times and it is still unsolved idk why? Whenever i share a vedio on instgram stories it's always lagging and and the voice always proceeds the image. It's way too ruined üëé‚òπÔ∏è,1
Updated this morning app has been bugging out not working right ever since,1
"Used Instagram for many years. App now won't even open, just throws me off straight away. Full of pages claiming people are sharing there only fans and showing videos of women. Full of spam amd the same boring rubbish.",1
"this app was really good for a long time but recently, after making reels and saving them to drafts, i go to post them and it's totally fine. but after being posted my video is completely gone and only the audio remains. it won't let me archive or save the post to my camera roll so i have no choice but to delete it. would give the 5 stars it deserves if this problem can be fixed",1
Can't post more than what I've recently posted on insta. My gallery is suddenly non existent and I can only post one picture at a time.,1
"Every time I share something with my boyfriend, the only person I ever share things with he's at the bottom below the people I ever rarely talk to, in the suggested contacts. If he's not there he's randomly at the top. It's never consistent. He used to be the top person and I never had to look for him. Now it's a constant battle of finding where he is via his Instagram tag, randomly down the bottom of the list. Sometimes the app is jittery too and randomly misbehaves.",1
"Why, when scrolling through my feed, did the camera get randomly accessed?",1
"It's been a month since my Instagram in not working.. Not even opened up.. Once i touch to open it, it showed plain white screen.. What to do..?",1
This new version is not support in samsung f22 model. Please update again.,1
New update broke the app. It crashes when one opens it exactly after 3 seconds. Can't you just test the new updates before releasing them?,1
"Every 4th story is an ad, every 4th post is an ad and now they moved the notification button to an inconvenient location so instead you click on the shop icon where notifications used to be. Design at its worst. You can't even see your own posting on the timeline anymore. Every update makes it worse. Unbelievable that people get paid for that. Update: now every third post is an ad. Good job üëç Update 2: Posting pictures doesn't work properly and now there is a permanent ""Photo can't be posted"".",1
Lost the search button to find where to search filters for reels,1
"I can't log in, it keep saying error ""the username you entered doesn't appear to belong to an account blablabla""",1
My Instagram app is not working properly i am not able to relpy any message in chat by taging there message and also cannot delete any message my ans well as there message also . Please fix this my Instagram is upto date,1

"Atrocious. Intstagram has a terrible censorship issue. If there was an alternative to reach the same audience, I would never go back to Instagram.",1
The app is been crashing alot on my samsung galaxy a13...quite annoying,1
Video play pause button is not appearing,1
Swipe reply and react on messages feature is not working in my account. I already have been report for the last 5-6 months but till now this issue doesn't solve.,1
I am not able to use the reply function on my application in direct messages. Can you please guide me what went wrong. Am i going to get a response regarding my issue.,1
Insta story save option not showing fix this issue as soon problem üò°,1
The newest update is absolute trash. The reels play for 5 seconds and then just freeze forever. If you leave the app it scrolls you back to the top and will only show you the first 3 or so posts until it freezes completely. And where you used to tap to pause a reel now you have to press and hold to pause making it impossible to pause at a specific moment and tapping mutes it. Also nothing loads,1
This notes feature is so irritating. Is there any way I can disable this thing? Currently I am individually muting every person who adds a note.,1
Still my bonuses option not showing i am working property and accordingly rules. My instagram account :- @sunil_kandara143,1
The comments get invisible and theme gets blackish automatically several times.,1
Such a bad experience having while chatting with someone and you are not getting any notification at allfor their messages. Disgusting like hellüëé,1
"Every second story is an ad. Suggested posts on the main feed sucks. Low UX. Also, there's an aspect ratio problem with Instagram Stories on my Huawei P9. Pics are getting cropped. And I don't want always to zoom out a photo. Lately, my keyboard is getting in front of the captions instead to push them up. It's really hard to write anything when you can't see what are you typing.",1
Make your ads om games able to be exited. Your ads totally stop my game,1
"Whenever I open this app, it always going blank, it shows white screen only. Please fix this, I already clear cache, reinstalled, but nothing happened.",1
"Worst app ever, it shows ""Instagram music is not available for some accounts"" whenever i try to make reelsüòë Anyone is there who is facing the same problem here?",1
"The new updates are not upgrades at all. My ""activity"" page never opens so I have to close and re-open the app. I can also no longer save drafts of my posts which is a basic function that was taken away. The addition of the ""shop"" and ""reel"" buttons are unecessary to be moved in place of the ""activity"" and ""new post"" buttons at the bottom of the screen; there should be an option to rearrange them to our own personal liking. Overall, these new updates are not working well; such a shame.",1
After the recent update the experience has been terrible. Few videos fail to load..they just won't play. Inspite of having a good connection with speeds of about 30-40 Mbps the video quality keeps changing. It is also consuming too much data after the update. My data pack was renenwed at 12.45 am after which I just used Instagram for about 20 mins and it consumed more than a 1 GB of data! There were no background updates being installed and hotspot was not given. I just used Instagram for 20min.,1
Home screen black and can't see comments. Before that I had to Uninstall and reinstall just to be able to post something. Absolutely sucks!,1
Pleasee resolve my issue of blank screen asap! It's been too long! It's around 1 week nd still the same blank sceeen appears..,1
"Deleted a finished, posted reel after I discarded the drafts. Very annoying",1
It doesn't open at all I tried to reinstall it but doesn't work I tried insta lite than it was working smoothly but now it is also not working it shows error and doesn't work,1
I am very disappointed for this bug whenever I try to login my page back it shows white screen I have done many tricks like clear cache clear data etc But nothing work pls solve this bug,1
Insta is not working properly..even after updating,1
"Deleting an account that is for my family that I hardly ever post on saying it went against community guidelines, sending me a code on my phone then telling me it's wrong. Instagram stop messing with people's pages. Leave us alone!",1
They disabled my account without any information. Can't login.,1
upload image & video post story very low..plez dont convert quality very low..hmm #android,1
"Not working, im trying to login its just giving me an error, so inconvenient",1
"The latest update of this app is very bad. The option which opens reels is bad. This facebook like structure is bad for this app. Earlier different videos were shown in one time and we can choose to see the video or image which we want to see by tapping on it, which is not possible now. Please restore the earlier version, that was far better than this Facebook like structure.",1
"Can't talk to anyone properly in message, can't even send message to anyone",1
"The latest update is the worst yet and seems to be trying to appeal to Tiktok users by turning Instagram into a poor imitation. It is now horrible to navigate and even worse to look at, the focus shifting more towards obnoxious video content that automatically plays, rather than pictures, which is the only thing Instagram had going for it. I won't be using this claustrophobic mess of an app unless they change things.",1
I would say Instagram so suck bad service when it comes posting photo and vid. Whenever I posted pic and vid on my IG account so really bad quality and vids were low and so vague I don't know It's became suddenly like that my phone is something really good quality but when I posted to my IG so suck so disgusting to see my vid stories and my pic but it's OK for me because I'm still not rich to afford iphone 14üòÖ therefore should be fair in the terms of quality when you posted it,1
Instagram is so bad now. My explore page is mostly ads. Instagram is riddled with ads now and is pushing reels too much.,1
"From last 2-3 days I have been facing the issues like I am unable to create a story, even if I try to upload a photo on my story as soon as I select the pic, it shuts down, same thing is happening while I am trying to create a reel, as soon as I add the audio it shuts down and shows ""Something went wrong:6"", I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times, have reported about the issue to instagram team, but the problem hasn't been resolved as yet.",1
My experience with instragram is not goog .I am not able to log in .wheever i tried to log in they say wait a few mint befire trying again and I can not get new messges from accounts that I do not follow and unrestricted option is not working,1
Why my instagram not responding? This apps force close and slow response. Done to logout-clear cookies-clear cache-clear data-uninstall-reinstall-update. Please fixed it!,1
"The latest update is extremely annoying. Why turn the usual feed into yet another copy of tiktok ? The Reels were already there for that purpose. Why deprive us from the pleasure of scrolling ? This being said, i guess it'll help become less addicted to the app, which isn't such a bad thing. Anyway, I'll only use it for messaging my friends until (hopefully) they turn it back to the way it used to be. I'm gonna miss seeing the content of my favorite artists tho",1
it is very good time on it but it makes us sometime unable to acces it and say to change password,1
"I have a problem where eveytjme I try to open the app, it only has a black screen and its getting really annoying. Please fix this soon.",1
Instagram is not working properly from last few days whenever I open the Instagram it shows black screen nothing is to be done .pls solve this issue as fast as soon we Instagram community facing many problems ..,1
Love instagram but it now seems like every new update is them coping other apps with their own worse version of those features,1
"Instagram is randomly reporting my account for no reason, I ain't did nun, I got mine suspended for defending myself from this entitled person that was being rude to me. I only was trying my best to not get myself into bad situation, Instagram chat system is becoming like Roblox chat system, Instagram should become like Discord, Reddit and ect that are actually goood.",1
Bro this app literally breach data 100percent because whenever I use it my phone become overheated.,1

"Could this be a precursor to the intensity (sometimes addictions) to technology that will push all technology into the abiss? I've read other reviews where there is frustration with IG being glitchy, etc. I just can't appreciate any company that forces their member base/customers to open up all phone permissions to let IG/FB/Meta do a deep dive into our phones. Which I'm sure they are anyway. What's next, deep dive in our homes, work, personal lives, DNA and so on. IG is not what it once was.",1

I made so many fantastic achievements just from being on ig in the first year, I hoped it wasn't too late for me to continue as was I 39. I hoped it'd keep inspiring me to do my best. I loved it.

Kindly resolve the issue asap. Also I'm facing issues with other things i reported problem as well but no response? Why?,1
"Update: yet another reason to 0 star this app. I have the latest version and it looks nothing like others. I have no ""reply"" options in messages, no options at the bottom of the screen and highlighting a message only gives 2 options in a pop up ""report"" or ""like"".

It's slower and I have to go out of my to share something that before I could do it in 2 seconds. They also took out the save post option which was one of my favorite features. I uninstalled the app because it's getting less intuitive",1

My Instagram has been showing a white screen for over a week now. I had almost no problems with it earlier but i can now only use Instagram lite or the web version. I logged out of my account and that's when the white screen error occurred. I hope it gets fixed soon but i really haven't seen any difference even after all the recent updates.,1
The Older Version was way better i dont like how the video posts are uploaded as reels and you cannot see how many views you have on post. I dont like the new latest version at all. Plus my views that i had on all my old reels has dropped views from 2000 views to 50 views,1
"Installed and tried to sign up. Twice. Both times there's an error (on your side), then email address can't be used to try again. No idea if this is a good program or not if it won't let me join the community! It then tells me that the accounts which I couldn't fully register have been suspended for violating the terms of service. What useless waste of space. Uninstalling",1
"This apps been broken for so long now, whenever i open the app it just shows a blank screen, i have tried all the methods i could find on google but none of them helped for example cleaning cache.",1
Instagram app is very unreliable. Today it won't let me post reels. I've uninstalled and started over. Again. Still not working.,1
"Instagram! Stop trying to be the old guy dressed as a ""cool kid"". NOBODY wants you to be TikTok!! The decision to automatically make my video POSTS as STORIES because ""tIkToK mAn!"" Is BEYOND the dumbest thing you have managed to do so far. I have to go to THE WEBSITE if I want my video posts to remain part of my feed and not the dumb ""Stories"". STOP IT!! NOW!",1
"The new update testing changes to the bottom navigation bar is very very bad. I have two versions on my two accounts, moving the ""new post"" button, the notifications button, and/or the search button into the small top corners of the app to make way instead for ""shopping"" and ""reels"". These are absolutely terrible decisions and shaft vital functions of the app away just to force unwanted gimmick features to the centre focus. These changes make the user experience much worse than before.",1

i dont know where to write this since there is no helpful article from instagram. my account which is private and i seldomly post suddenly gets suspended due to violating community guidelines WITHOUT stating a definite proof and just locking me out of my account without any way to retrieve it. such a shameful way a multimillion company just deletes someones private account without any just cause. instagram team please respond and reinstate my account immediately,1

It won't let me restrict the cookies, and it also won't let me accept them all. So, now instagram is reduced to a cookie prompt. Absolute rubbish, don't install this! Every time they change something, it breaks a bit more! Now it is unusable!",1

Dear instagram right now I can't send massage for 3 day I don't know why this type of error showing in my account I not did anything against instagram guideline please review my account and solve this issue on my ID,1
One star because Instagram doesn't suggest my account to others for following me . Also I have posting my content but there are no views on content. Soon I will delete Instagram,1
It has no update. I can't update it .I tried many times. But it's doesn't work properly,1
I didn't get reels bonus option yet even I have 18k followers on my account. This is not fair Instagram team,1
"Normally, I won't bother to do a review but right now, it's absolutely horrible. I deleted the app a couple of days ago for space. Decided to re-download it today & up to now it is not opening at all. I would press the icon and it opens goes blank and then states that it can't be opened, period. It's really annoying because I literally use this app to communicate and to advertise my businesses. It is giving me a hard time and I am not able to post any content, due to this. Fix it, please!",1
It's has many glitches and notes features doesn't shows Iam reported a problem after this they won't react I hate instagram,1
"While posting a Post the Instagram Music works but as soon it's posted it shows a banner like THIS SONG IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE for any song and any artist.

Black screen when activate the app. Tried uninstall and reinstall several times but still the same. Hope action would be taken on this issue.,1
while posting photo the audio option is not available...,1
Vety bad experience Many glitches app not work well Need stable and improvement in next update.....,1
"The new update is disgusting. The focus on making a profit through the placement of the shopping button is blatantly obvious, and completely changes the experience of the app. The new posting button is unnecessarily complex. The algorithm does not follow chronological posting and does not show you everything, disadvantaging small platforms. The new content guidelines are puritanical. Thanks for nothing, F@cebo0k.",1
"it's not working well , i can't receive any messages and calls, I try reinstalled it but still not working. I hope you can fix it soon as possible, Cuz i have a lot of transaction that needed to finish hereü•¥",1
"Lots of problems of uploading, it stops working and cancels everything you have done if you minimise the app, doesn't upload correctly the size of pictures, doesn't accept different sizes in the same post. If you want to remove a picture and replace with a new one you have to do the whole post from beginning as it changes the size and editing progress. Very annoying and frustrating.",1
I'm a big fan of Instagram I love all it's surprising features. But there is a small problem which I can't find some songs in insta music and when I click on any song to open it's details from others Stories wasn't opening even if I click multi times and some effects are not opening in my insta I don't know why and when I want to save any edited video or photo from story before uploading it then it takes so much time to save in camera roll and sometimes it even doesn't saves hoping to fix it,1
"Lately, I've noticed that the texts on my IG stories appeared glitchy. It looks like my phone screen is broken but only the part covered by the text. This also happens whenever I put a location tag on my IG story. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but the same problem recur. Please help in fixing this or could you at least tell me how to fix this bug or what causes it. Thanks.",1
App does not even cover the full phone screen.,1
"Edit- thinking of quitting the app, because of the amount of irritating bugs, the reels just keep on repeating, even after i saw them, the ones that i like don't get liked amd then show up on my feed again, no improvement from thr company, plus unnecessary limit on content reach. Original- Why is it that the reels I have already liked and saw keep coming back on my feed over and over and over again, it is so frustrating. I have shared these reels but still the show up on my feed again.",1
"The app rolls out updates daily, but the bugs never leave, instead new ones are introduced. Just now I was unable to post any stories at all during to constant crashing. I had to reinstall the app without the beta programme to post the stories and guess what? Now I can't post reels and I somehow have a pre-2020 version of the app that is the current android version. Please fix something. This app used to great but its driving people away to other platforms.",1
"I'm on the latest version of this app and it's already disappointing. One minute I see I have all my posts on my page and the next time I check my page none of my posts, reels are up. It's showing as its deleted when I've not even deleted a single post! It's outrageous and very disappointing. I have no words to say how angry and sad I am. And every time I try to post my reel, the app simply crashes. It's really frustrating. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.",1
"It's unbelievable that this app has been unable to open because of crashing for 4 days now. I've reached out to support multiple times, and have heard nothing and nothing has been resolved. And yes, I've checked for updates, uninstalled and reinstalled, deleted my cache blah blah blah.",1
Instagram reels are hang so i do not enjoy reels plz solve this problem,1
"Not able to log in back my I'd plz help me it's not showing anything after opening the app it's show just a complete blank doesn't appear anything after opening app it's not even showing the login option, it just show completely nothing totally bkank plzzzz..... Help me what to do plzzzzzzzzz..................",1
Stupid app don't refresh when opening or screen dies i lost where i left off will uninstall,1
"Instagram has stopped working when I try to like any video in my timeline for the past two weeks; to avoid this bug, I must first open the video and then like it.",1
"The conversations tab is glitching. It constantly shows that there's a message request pending even when there isn't one. The new update is garbage. Why would you put the shopping tab right next to the profile button? It makes using the app super uncomfortable. I'm here for the content and chats, but now I keep pressing that stupid button out of habit and it opens the shops which are not even in my area/country. Completely irrelevant and annoying!",1
"App is buggy as hell. Notifications when there is nothing new to check. Drafts becoming a graveyard of glitched, unrecoverable posts. If y'all are going to attempt to compete with TikTok y'all might wanna make sure that the functionality is there. All of my reels have been full of glitches: text layers get warped, sometimes footage is completely eaten up. Just brutal.",1
Using Instagram accounts last 5 years but suddenly ihave cheng my fone.then Instagram not logged in trouble isshu can't reciv cod on my gmail .I'd report Instagram 100 time but no reply from Instagram.....,1
For those having Blank or White screen issues>>> Update google playe service from playstore. If it is updated then clear all data of Google Play Services. Then Clear data of Instagram app. And restart app. It should work fine.,1
Automatically my Instagram starts updating and all my chat theme changes and all the effects that I saved has gone by it own .This is the worst experience with Instagram. Instagram needs to correct it as soon as possible!,1
This app is having so many bugs now. Worst experience ever since.,1
app is not working last 2 days.. Bad experience..,1
Have been using Instagram since the start of times. Previously the algorithm was great for sharing videos on a public profile. However now the reach has lowered drastically. The same videos i share on my profile don't get views but if shared on others does get proper audience and views. Also the bugs are uncountable. Collab requests are not received. If received and you view request on message section it just shows the reel. No options can be seen to accept or decline. It's getting worse.,1
"My experience of using Instagram has been great but now a days, I'm experiencing this issue that when I select multiple pics to upload & I edit them, all the photos become the same and so, same photo appears in the feed in the post. Note: My app is already updated. Please resolve this! I'm not able to upload any post due to this from a month. Now, the app is crashing and not getting opened. When i edit any pic and check to compare from the original one, it automatically changes the filter too!",1
The uploading/ cropping/ deleting pictures are difficult,1
"It seems that reporting anything is useless. Noone even checks the reports and there is seriously inappropriate stuff on here sometimes. I also can't access my message requests, I had a bunch of stuff I kept there and it's all gone, the messenging part of Instagram is constantly crashing since you did the Facebook connect thing which I DON'T WANT!!! I've had to change my password twice in the last week to log in because I'm being logged out and then my new password doesn't work. FIX THE APP",1
Not working at all uninstalled many times but always Reloading,1
"Updated , but yet not receiving the features of schedule post yet üôÅ",1
not working at all earlier it was showing bug tried updating no result then I uninstalled ans re- install it and now it doesn't even open just a blank white screen shows I am pissed with this issue I try everything but it wasted please look into the issue as soon as possible fix it,1
"Basically sucks. Limit of 10 pictures, can't individually label pictures, auto crops pictures for no good reason, shows people by nicknames rather than their actual name so you're constantly guessing who it is that's posting/commenting, etc. etc. I don't even like Facebook, yet it's 100 times better and more user friendly for posting pictures.",1
To much gltich some time showing messages and sometimes not showing,1
"The initial one star was for suggested feed error. But now the app glitches. It takes forever to load. Have tried clearing cache, reinstalling and everything. Still issue exist",1
Oh my good. I can't post anything. The app keeps crashing. Either goes back to switching my account to the same account AGAIN. And then i get a message saying the app keeps stopping. My stories are flawed. The app user interface has become terrible. I uninstalled. And installed. It's still the same. Why can't i post or anything..terrible.,1
"Update: Privacy breach. Even though I didn't give contact permission, instagram somehow still accessing it, giving recommendation to follow with clear mention of 'first name & last name' as saved in my contacts. The apps have VERY LIMITED interactivity. For example there's absolutely nothing can be done with comments except to ""see"" or ""report"". Links are un-click-able, text are unselectable.",1
Again after updating the app i cannot use instagram. It keeps closing the application again and again. Why is it that everytime an update comes instagram starts crashing!!!!! Fix this bug!!!,1
My account has been hacked via phishing and Instagram isnt doing anything about it! I even sent video selfie to them and no damn reply! This is messed up!,1
Worst App I Ever Seen So Many Ads Are Going Sometimes Features Not Working Correctly Id Is Banning Without Any Reason.,1
"I was hopeful that the latest update would fix my problem but it did not. I cannot get the app to work. It's just a white screen every time. I have tried every single trick to get it to work from Uninstalling and reinstalling to clearing the cache from the app as well as from my phone. Still just get the logo then a white screen. I have emailed Instagram, but it's impossible to get any tech support.ü•≤",1
Filter option not showing. Please fix it.,1
"Shite app, my account got banned for literally no reason and I can't get it back , there's years worth of memories in archive and on highlights that I can't ger back.",1
"The new update is terrible, I don't like it at all. I don't like that there is no space between posts, that they swap like reels up and down, not visible description text - it was better when it was under the post on a blank white background, difficulties to play videos, I like to save posts quickly and to have save button on each post instead of clicking the dots then save... All in all the worst update by far...",1
"this is one of the only social media apps I use, and I've enjoyed using it up until recently. I upload videos to Instagram frequently and lately every video I post ends up looking glitchy and corrupted. no matter how many times I re-post or re-edit my footage, it always comes out corrupted. the footage, when uploaded to any and every other site/app, remains fine. it's only Instagram that has this problem. this needs to be fixed.",1
It is so good aap I can search my frnds on it can talk to them and can watch so many things in it and can make new frnds too üòä,1
Not working for me trying from morning Look into this even not opening in my phone Why it's happening,1

I'd reported my bug in the follow button but there is no response....the follow button is still remaining unfollowed for the new followers after clicking the follow button,1
"Whenever i place video call to someone, my phone stucks there and reboots automatically.",1
This app has too many bugs. I can't repost a single thing to my story,1
Instagram is good but there was a problem my account has not showing note options....,1
Why you don't create an option to see who unfollowed you! Too many ads!,1
Nothing works right anymore. It's all glitchy and full of adds.,1
"New ""better"" update is horrible. I'm logged out of my logged out of my account and can't get back in and I've tried different things: resetting my password FIVE TIMES, checking to see if I was disabled or my account was deleted but nothing. It keeps saying ""strange activity"" but I haven't been doing anything wrong. Been follow guidelines, ect. So fix it. Would rate this app a zero if I could !",1
"After 2 years, Instagram still hasn't fixed the bug of permanent stories. Deleting the story, Uninstaller the app, updating app... nothing works. At some point you will have a story that is permanent and can never be deleted and will sit there for years. Broken app and they refuse to fix it or acknowledge all the reddit posts over the last years about the same thing.",1
The reels ruined the app. That sums it all up. The app used to be a place for pics but now its just a piece of garbage dumped all together. Why cant there b a pg only dedicated t pics and the reels will be shown in a different page? Such a simple change might make the app tolerable again and make the what its truly made for. Pics........,1
Not able to use only black screen Please do something about it. I really hate this type of bug All of a sudden this happened please take care of it. A shame to u Instagram,1
Y'all ever gonna fix the blank login page or you just gonna leave android users out forever?? People in other reviews saying it's fixed and I just reinstalled and it is not. It's still a blank login page.,1
Can't share any reels on my story. Even i can't share my own reels on story.

Instagram id : vinaypagariya,1
"I am using instagram from 3 years till now...And idk what has happened to this app that when I open the app, a blank space appears...I tried uninstalling and then reinstalled but still doesn't works...Please fix this",1
if i could rate it the worst app on the entire app store play store i would. Absolute garbage. Just awful. Now they removed the option to save your own STORY. To the developers: How do you go to bed at night knowing you made such horsesh√Æt of an app and cant manage to make it not bug in someway for oneeee measly day? How does it feel knowing yahoo messenger had less bugs than this garbage pathetic excuse of an app,1
I have decided to use instagram Clone apps because the amount of ads are getting ridiculous. They overshadow & flood the content you follow. This is unbearable. Once I install the clone I will delete this app.,1
"I can't login from the website because I have to confirm my info in the app, but the app just opens up to a blank screen and won't let me confirm my info. How am I supposed to access my account if the app won't work?!?",1
"It is a good program, but it discriminates and does not open its capabilities to other countries.For example, the feature of reels",1
Why the stories can't even 20 sec lengthy make it 1 min . It's so annoying . And there are so many videos that is either half or unfinished posted on insta .,1
You should be able to tag people you aren't following and who aren't following you. Also they have this weird thing that not only blocks your account but future accounts you make. Also I've met so many scam artists on here trying to get money from me with no way to report them. And they have this new thing in messages that that keeps this down pointing arrow in the way of reading messages.,1
Every new update is going on my nerves Instagram rules are getting more and more stupid everyday. Features are getting worse. Download options are the least you can add instead of changing the visuals every time,1
I like this app ..but recent updates are not god...some audio are not seen and some audio searches are not seen .... i not able to insert reels and stories.... what will be do.,1
What is up suddenly with the app? It keeps crashing as soon as I open it. This is not happening with any other app on my phone so it's a bug with the app,1

"Instagram has lost its meaning, this was supposed to a site for my friends sharing their photos. Today, i see non of that, except endless reels and ads i care nothing about.",1

"App used to be great but now it will no longer allow me to veiw my saved photos , i have tried deleting and re-installing the app, restarting my phone but no luck so far??????",1
Why do you refuse to even acknowledge the Android black screen issue. It's been over a week since my app worked. Obviously you don't care since you are the all powerful Meta and people have no choice...,1
"Instagram deleted my now wife and my private shared account we opened when we first started dating. As a cute way to document our journey.

Everytime i try to open the app it works for like 10 seconds and kicks me off. I tried clearing the cache. And uninstalling didnt work either,1

"Full of time waste.. we spend so much time on in. this is a western app , they make reels to earn money , they put there value down, and waste our time which is the most expensive thing. nooone can buy time and we are wasting our time on it!!!",1
Latest update crashes constantly! Once the app opens trying to do anything in the app causes it to crash.,1
I literally cant reply to a specific message. The swipe to reply feature is not provided to me. I need it. It's pathetic that instagram has provided it to some and not to others.,1
Latest version has a Reel issue. Scroll 3 to 4 videos down and nothing else wat6s to load and when refreshing it comes up eith an error.,1
I had worst experience with that I don't know why my account has been disabled in the help centre they can't give any response to disable my account it has been totally discuss with the app if it's has done another time surely I can uninstall to the app,1

"I can't use this app properly always i starting it it was a bag and automatically closed... i cant even reface the page, i can't upload photos and rels fixed this as soon as possible",1

I'm seeing contents and posts from accounts I don't follow and seeing a lot of ads due to which I've started to hate the app. I highly recomment the officials to remove such unwanted posts.,1

The music sticker lyrics does not show/work anymore for me. I don't know why but it's frustrating especially when I want to share lyrics on my story.,1

Seems like after September 12th 2022 update it has gotten super slow. And I mean lower than dial up . I don't think me nor anyone have patience for that kind of thing.,1
Dear Instagram developer please make sure the updates are useful for the user not to irritate the user. After updating it was crashing every 2-3 minutes it's not at all a good news for the #metadeveloper please resolve this issue META DEVELOPERS AND INSTAGRAM DEVELOPERS,1
NOTHING WORKS AS IT SHOULD. Seriously who creates a social media website made for sharing photos that only allows you to share 10 pics at a time!!!??? And doesn't allow you to edit them after they have been posted!!!??,1
They never answer you when you send a message concerning a problem with the app. I have written them twice concerning my problem and not one answer.,1

"persistent bug where my entire screen is blank every time i open the app, i've tried everything to fix it but nothing works.",1
Instagram giving a platform to fake merchants to advertise their products at attractive prices so that people will attract to it and lost the money which they paid. And also didn't get the product.,1
"What is this new update??? Feels like instagram is back to it's very first version ever, all features like tagging messages, reacting to messages with various emojis, everything is gone.",1
I tried to open an account since yesterday and it keeps on telling me can't accept you request try again later. this is extremely frustrating and Instagram has been going downhill after all these updates trying to be like tiktok,1
I'm giving 1 star because my reel section algorithm changed anonymously and suddenly. The things which I'm shown right now are completely different from the things i was seeing before . Kindly fix it .,1
"When Instagram started with was a fun photo based platform, where image makers could find like minded folks to share thier work with. Now it's just another Tik Toc, literally, Instagram is full of tik toc videos instead of photos. It's a joke and a shame.",1
The new layout is annoying. It keeps showing old posts. Why do I have to make an extra click to see recent posts. Instagram really needs to bring old layout back,1
Not what it used to be. Instagram used to be great but trying to keep up with tiktok ruined it. Reels are just reposted tiktoks. If i wanted to watch tiktoks I'd open the app,1
"Crashes all the time, freezes all the time, forces content I have no interest in and the not interested button doesn't do a thing.",1
"Instagram keeps removing my videos even though I'm using music from a paid subcription service, literally no videos are allowed to have music at this point.",1
i made a mistake and i made a story which was against the rules. but that doesnt mean i shouldnt login into my account ever again. i said okay but the warning still doesnt go away. please fix this. its been 3 hours.,1
The new algorithm shows my pics to only 10% of my followers which is why I'm not able to reach to my entire audience. This is absolutely worst!!! Do better #instagram,1
It won't let me post and keeps crashing or stopping. What is going on.. i even tried uninstalling and re installing. Bad user experience.,1
Yikes. I wish I didn't update this app recently. All of my drafts won't show and I had planned on posting them with full captions.,1

I have been using Instagram for more than 10 years and now I have doubt on it's security and help. My Instagram account is hacked by someone and it had my 10 years of journey which I was attached with. I have mailed Instagram and Facebook and no reply or action has been taken regarding it. I have also gone through the procedure given by Instagram and submitted my video and photo with official govt. Id..!! I request Instagram to recover my account or I am not going to trust any social media app.,1
I've tried numerous times to get this app to load and all I ever get is meta logo and a blank screen. Judging by the reviews I'm not the only one. PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP!!,1
I opened Instagram like I normally do and it's a blank white page. I have followed all the instructions I can to try and reinstate this app but to no avail. What can be done? I'm reading other posts and so far no one seems to be getting any help,1
"App not open from last 1 month ,when i open the app the black screen will appear ,i cant login or doesnt show any kind of login menu , its getting disturbing pls solved these issue .",1
I used to love Instagram but now it's not fun anymore. My content doesn't get shown. There is no room for creativity here. You are rewarded for using the same sounds as everyone else. It only kills your self esteem by making you feel like your not good enough no matter how hard you try.,1

It's not working properly when ever I open insta it's shuts off plzzz solve this problem and I can't open my second account it's not logging in plzz try to solve the problem again n again same problem I can't even login my account,1
"Videos freezed when I double tap them and sometimes, they freeze for the tiniest scroll. Reels and similar stuff are annoying because I cannot seek back and forth. My phone's screen is pretty long and when I am trying to enjoy an image, the video below it starts playing. When I am scrolling through videos (with muted sounds) and my music player is playing something, I can hear Instagram pausing the music for a very short time and it is super annoying. And a lot more, get it together Facebook.",1
Very bad feeling. Here now. Can't upload reels,1
"Whenever I opened the app, its loading like eternity. All pictures and videos take way too much time to show up. Even my friends stories cannot be seen. It has been 7 days now, and I'm losing my patience and decide to complain here. It is definitely not because of my internet connection. They are fine since I can open Facebook without problem. Please give me a solution asap.",1
Was working fine out of nowhere nothing loads cant use it and said i had a login from some pc in mountain view California,1
"Was immediately suspended when I signed up and they wanted me to argue the suspension without even telling me what it was for and give my phone number... I don't know if they wanted me to call them and have a debate over the phone, but I'm not sending my number to Instagram. Pretty sure I got the instant-block because my name was fartknocker. Thumbs down for Instagram having the skin thickness of a Sunday school Karen",1
"Not able to use in Android phone. It is showing black screen on opening the app. Since last 7 days, I'm unable to use the app.",1
Not working properly on samsung smartphone video pauses only audio plays video stucking reels stucking and story also not cleared remaining low and story not play and video not playing,1
"If it had chronological posts it would have 5 stars, simple as that.",1
"I tried to create a Reel but the music didn't finish until the end of the video. I tried two or three times with different videos always had the same issue, editing the clips seemed error too. Then I uninstalled the app, in couple of hours I reinstalled and I got very basic version, without Reel option, only Post, Story and Live üòÖ",1
So many glitches whenever I try to make one reel it's so irritating,1
I got my account disabled and I don't know why. I only interact with two ppl in my dms. I don't leave comments or even post much anymore. I'm confused and scared because the app won't let me submit my email to appeal this decision. I know once I do Instagram will see I did nothing wrong. I don't understand why this is happening. All I do is celebrate my family and post videos about anime and pop culture.,1
"This is my main application that I use all day. The problem is whenever I open my Instagram camera, the screen becomes smaller and a black line appears at the bottom due to which the picture quality deteriorates and in this quality I am not able to make photos and reels.  I found this problem in many people's phones, Please solve this issue as soon as possible.",1
I m not able to add music in stories ..the music option is not showing help,1
"I'm currently having a ton of issues with this app and in less than a month, I've figured out that this app is the least supportive with helping me grow my online business. To specify a few, the app never posts my posts on time, displaying a connection issue even if there isn't any, there are problems while editing my drafts and often times, the sound in my videos are automatically disabled once it gets posted... there are just too many of such issues to mention.",1
"Worst updates,In the name of community guidelines and security,they r blocking my account many times without reasons and after reporting they r not fixing it...üò°üò°üò°",1
Honestly i loved this app alot... but like these days its been lagging ALOT and when im posting a story its greenish and pink... and if i want to post a screen shot its white... like i cant post stories .. and its lagging alot ... instagram stops working after every few minutes and i hate it.. instagram doesnt even deserve A single star..... Please fix these problems or the people will stop using instagram,1
It seems like every update there is more issues. Reels glitch and video doesnt play but the sound does and certain features wont work like the flash and opening and recording with the camera. How about instead of adding features fix the features that are already there. Its getting ridiculous the amount of times i got close the app and reopen again to work one thing at a time,1
I am using instagram from very long but i am really dissapointed this time like my all accounts have been suspended and i can't find the solution to find out what happened with my account....i am still trying to get inside of my account but still unable to get in and I am getting logged out every time I get in... ...but still instagram is one of my favorite app so please help me figure it out what happened with all my account .....,1
"Highlights viewers >24h + translation option disappeared with the update and this is very disappointing. Bring it back and stop ignoring all the negative comments about the recent update. + App freezes regularly. Also sometimes you just can't post (""Not posted yet, try again"" and then it doesn't work doesn't matter how many times you try so you cancel and you loose everything, text and picture editing. Very frustrating).",1
"Now the issue is it won't let me post instagram stories, sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't, sometimes only boomerangs or very short ones, otherwise not at all, or just video and no audio. Comes up with ""sorry this could not"" or something like that it's very frustrating so i have had to film first on my phones camera, then upload to stories which means i don't get to use the filters i like.",1
Too much ads showing even it is not related to me it seems like i am using Instagram just to watch their nonsense all ads. I dont want to rate this app even a star worse ads app not social media it is ads menu try seeing different ads. Worse social media app ever i have seen only ads after ads.,1
"I can't get enough of complaining about this app. My account is full of bugs. Even after getting into beta program there are no changes. Also, sometimes there is problem at uploading story. Sometimes when i share a post, two same posts are shared, sometimes i can't get access to drafted reels, sometimes I'm not able to edit any video. I'm literally going crazy over it. I have complained about it alot many times in the app itself.",1
"It seems that every update brings more and more ""features"" I DON'T want. The UI is all shuffled, and REALS seems to be the focus, and the post a simple picture to my feed button is in a sub menu. The favorites button has moved too. How about, just put it back the way it was, the way that WORKED.",1
I would give it zero stars if i could. I was locked out of both of my insta accounts during it's glitch a few weeks ago. The system was so messed up I couldn't even send reset password links even though my password wasn't wrong. I was able to sign in on a desktop once after being locked out but that stopped working right away. Instagram is refusing to give me access to my second with no explanation. I have been spamming them every day and hardly getting response. Worst service EVERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!,1
Why is Instagram restricting certain actions? I like Instagram. It's ruining my actions for the app. Why did they take the message option away when we go to people's pages,1
"Changing from iphone to Android. Draft posts do not appear always. I have to create a new draft post, go back to save to see previous drafts for a brief moment. The drafts row keep disappearing and I had to keep making new drafts to fish the previous one out. The worst part is, I cannot delete them. Drafts keep piling up. Never had this problem with iPhone. Very annoying. Pls fix this bug!",1
Monopoly of restrictions of genuine urls is still the same with Facebook maybe it's owned by a family ........boring,1
"After the recent update, the app sometimes gets stuck at ""Processing"" and doesn't allow you to post the photos. Clearing cache didn't help. Reinstalling the app works, but it is not feasible to do this a few times a work. Generally the app works well, so I hope the team can resolve the bugs soon.",1
Everytime I have to uninstall and then reinstall it in order to use it again properly üò≠üò≠,1
"ok so ive been hacked for a week, tried all available resources for me, and did the last resort facial recognition function and still got no result (it said that the maximum amount of time is 4 work days, which has passed) so now i cant contact anyone through live chat, no number i can call etc, what do i do?",1
"From last three days, app is performing worst. Whenever i tried to open, it shows a blank screen. I have been tried many times after restart of my phone..even i have uninstalled the app many times and also cleared the cache. I don't know whats going on.. but team have to fixed this issue. We cannot expect this type of worst behavior from a reputed company.",1
"The recent update is absolutely disgusting Not sure who came up with the idea of chipping away their USP Very inconvenient and inconsiderate design. Extremely disappointed with the UX With that big of a user base, i think it's fair to think of an ambiguous way of solving problems, not creating more. Please bring back the old interface. Thanks",1
Too many glitches and bugs you need to fix it asap it is very annoying,1
"Edit 09Apr2021: Previous issues is still unfixed; newest issue is that I can't swipe on a message to reply. I have to tap hold till the options pop up and select ""reply"". Not sure how or why that has suddenly happened. Edit 30Sept2020: I still can't share an igtv to my story that plays sounds and shows a moving video, available on my other accounts, except my main account. It still only shows a static thumbnail.",1
Iam getting lots of updates but we're is the reply option it's not working in my device.. :(,1
"I used to love this app but I haven't been able to login. It shows the logo and then just turns into a black screen. I've tried uninstalling it, restarting my phone, everything. Nothing works. Im really disappointed seeing as this has apperently been going on for awhile now and Instagram has done nothing to fix it.",1
Unable to open you app from last 15 days. After launch freezes on black screen. Checked all permissions and checks of phone. All other apps working fine. Phone samsung f62,1
Good experience Very easy to use the app very easy to download and like comments and shears full time spent to this app,1
Very bed...so many glitches..so many bugs ...so irritating app ..please instagram dhyaan doooo üôèüôè,1
"Instagram is being really buggy. Can instagram please be fixed. I cannot post singular videos on it, it does nothing when I press the first tick. Also, I cannot trim a video through the app without the video being glitchy and cover photos do not work. I pick a cover photo, post the video and the cover photo I picked is not there. Instagram is really annoying me atm and I would like it fixed please so I can enjoy using it again. Thank you. Please get this resolved.",1
"App is super glitchy these last few months. Sometimes goes to white screen when you click to a new page, then needs shut down the app to use it again, zoom function results in the image snapping back to offscreen, among other things. Very basic functionality not working correctly anymore. Looks like someone broke master, and it desperately needs fixing. Several updates later and still no fixes for the issues. Should roll back to a working release as an update.",1
I changed my password day before yesterday and i just log out my account n now when i am tryin to enter in my account password is showing wrong same glitch with all account due to this i ihave to change password all time,1
"The green dots next to my friends profile pictures in my DM have disappeared! Even if I've enabled activity status in the settings menu, it shows the last time they've been active but not the green dot indicator. However, their green dot indicators are shown when I search up their names. I'd really love for them to come back.",1
"Before the latest update instagram used to automatically give a full screen experience when posting stories.. let it be an image text or a video, now the menu options occupied more space and it is annoying ! Please bring back the older version with menu displayed over the stories.. until.then i.. and we prefer to give the lowest rating.. and would recommend to do the same to my friends since we all are annoyed with this ! Ps. Appreciate your feedback as well !",1
"Dark mode doesn't 'stay' on dark mode for long. Every single time i do anything other than scroll on my feed and like posts (like opening and closing a DM), parts of the app turn white. This wouldn't be that much of a problem, but since the text itself stayed white to accommodate for the original dark background, reading anything is impossible. Countless updates later, this issue still hasn't been fixed",1
"There are so many bugs and problems with this app, especially since the change in Canada where supposedly only you could see number of likes on your post (which is completely untrue anyhow ... just have to use it online). And the way the feed is manipulated in order that you spend as much time on the app as is possible and also have to scroll through so many ads is beyond irritating. No wonder the majority of people eventually quit or become completely inactive. Total bs, the attention economy!",1
"Horribly bugged. In dark mode the colors glitch. IGTV is disproportionate to my screen. It often bugs to black and I can't continue opening pics or anything. The message slot bugs so I can't send messages, only type them. Can't modify my notification settings. I set it to low priority and it keeps waking up my screen instead, now I uninstalled and put notifications back to default but sometimes I don't get them at all.",1
"Help center doesn't help me get my hacked account back, disappointed, and collaborator option didn't show up",1
always unable to see photos even when your internet is stable,1
Telling me I don't have an account but yet you people send me notifications to my email address saying I've mail and visitors. It's a joke just like other apps out there.,1

I remember my information correctly but it simply not working. When I try to ask for backup code the page refuse to upload, and shows up ""error there's a problem in this page we're solving now"" something like that. I reported the issue but no response yet.",1

"It has been a week now that my app can't function at all. I have been restarting my phone countless times, reinstalling the app, clearing caches and data, and it still goes blank everytime I open the app. Nothing to show. No options or any help guidance. I have sent an email to Instagram for android support but I still got no resolution. Screen still blank.",1
My Instagram is not updated even after deleting it. It's not updated yet so what should I do?,1
"Recent software and app update means I am unable to upload photo to story as my gallery thumbnails are just blank images. Very frustrating. Since the update the app has been buggy. I have lost all my drafts and when I create another one and save it as a draft, it stays for about 10 minutes then goes. This also seems to happen if I switch between my 2 insta accounts too. So frustrating!!!! I'll update my review when this has been resolved or I hear back.",1
My Instagram is not opening. As I open the App it automatically gets closed... Plz fix the problem...... I can't able to open or install Instagram,1
I do not have the latest updates not even one of them I can't even reply to a message pls help me fix this I have reported it many times,1
"Please change it back to its original form. The new updated layout is not convenient and not effective for a person who enjoys the platform for its photography posts and saves alot of content. Horrible! I have a very tough time saving reels in collections too, I need to do double work by saving them to collections inside the saved. Please fix this issue. I have having so much glitches and errors when I upload 10 carousel post. The app is having a hard time processing these images.",1
"I just updated the app and everything is upside down. There is this huge white space at the bottom when I launch the app. Don't turn IG to Facebook, too many unnecessary suggestions,""because I watched a reel from a random page"" doesn't mean you should give me suggestions of their reels?! If I want to watch more reels of a particular page, I would just go to the page. So if I watch 10(assuming they have 1000s of reels each),you would show me 10,000 reel suggestions??!!! Let IG be clean n simple.",1
Random p‚≠êÔ∏èrn bots keep liking my stories. The app is full of disgusting bots. It makes me want to vomit... do something about it,1
Just full of bugs and a replacement app for tiktok now,1
I am updating so many Times but notes feature Is not showing,1
Third time now Instagram just crashes and can't be fixed by reinstalling or anything. App is constantly full of bugs. Stop breaking what isn't broken please!,1
"Instagram is changing, for the WORSE. The platform is really making people want to leave with the latest update. Posts now have some ugly borders using a random color picked from the picture which becomes more attention-getting than the picture itself. Caption is extended onto the picture instead of displayed seperatedly below the picture like before, and when the picture is mainly white then goodluck with your vision. Caption translation is gone as well. I think it's time to leave the platform.",1
"The app was fine and amazing until 2 days ago, my messages stopped sending and my feeds wouldn't load. I don't know if it's an update but I'm not the only person having this issue. Please fix this. Update- it's been about a week and I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times and it's still the same. I don't recommend this app to anyone at this point in time",1
"Add more stickers related to the festivals like navratri and etc and I am unable to save the clicked pics or it takes too much time while saving the pics also there is problem in posting any videos , full video is just impossible to post Worst performance",1
Not able to view insta post on homepage....many glitch occurs,1
The way logarithms are used is unfairnews feeds and logarithms are not consistant,1
Too much glitch Sometimes it throughout outside not able to see status,1
"It hasn't been working right in 3+ days,, I'm wondering what's happening..",1
"The problem with this app has been prevalent for a very long time yet nothing has been done to fix it. But now another one arises. Everytime I scroll a little further down than Instagram expects me to, the entire app lags, doesnt allow me to scroll and eventually crashes. The worst part being that if i mistakenly clear the app from my multitask bar the app wont let me in again without crashing. I've been having to redownload the app every 5-10 mins just to run it. Oppo F5, horrible experience",1
1 star forever! From 2018 when I joined Instagram your app became worse and worse. And now in 2022 it's a d... sh...,1
Dear Instagram team my Instagram is not support to swipe reply option in message is not update o0tion,1
"Please update my Instagram Messenger and also whenever somebody mentions me in there story I can't put it more than 15 seconds, but others can! Please fix this as soon as possible.",1
Instagram won't refresh at all. None of the stories posted from earlier that day are available either and can't any new ones.,1
"Worst app. I turned on two factor authentication and when I reset my phone I lost my access to authenticator. When I login they give me an option to submit request. I submitted the request and they replied to attach a photo with holding a number and name. I do so, and they again mailed that the authentication is off and now you can login. But it didn't work. All replies happen in a fraction of seconds. They do not care about their users and problems. They only want money ü§ë",1
"I can't share posts via stories. It's almost a year as that option is available for,, everyone "" but it's not for my .WHY!? I have two business acount, I pay you for advertising ,I have the newest version of app, I've tried write to support for help but without any response despite a lot of tries. I really need that option in my accounts. App doesn't work properly. It's unacceptable that that after so long time I don't have access to all function , and your support doesn't answer .",1
"I'm rarely compelled to write reviews, but this is ridiculous. The May 2022 update has pretty much destroyed Instagram. It's not tiktok, and nobody using it wants it to be tiktok. Images and videos now look terrible covered with gradients and text, descriptions can't be read due to bad contrast and are largely hidden (and cover the image or video you're there to see). The layout is claustrophobic and hard to use / parse and is generally just totally awful. Nobody wants reels in mixed on either..",1
"Frustrating. üò† I have been having issues with my Instagram since last year. Earlier it was only not posting any new photos. I tried troubleshooting every possible way I can think of (including the methods suggested on online troubleshooting help forums). Nothing worked. I even sent a report to Instagram support, but there has been no response. Atleast I was able to view other's posts and pictures and could view DMs just fine. Now my all has stopped launching. It just doesn't open up anymore.üò°",1
"Until the latest update the app was working real good but after the update, I am having trouble loading any content. I click on an image and it doesn't load, it goes blank. I have reported the same to the support on app. There wasn't any reply or ways to fix this. I celared the cache, re-installed the app but nothing seems to work.",1
from last 3 days feeds not updating...very bad experience,1
So many bugs .... Also shows error many times...,1
It is working slowly I can't open only white page is open,1

"I was watching a friend's instagram story and I wanted to screenshot part of it when the bottom of my screen while viewing (the area where the text/message box usually is) goes black.

Please fix, or advise on how to fix this and return to full screen view. Thank you.",1
"Whenever I select a picture that are displayed in the search option, there is just a blank white page. If I try to see the list of my friend's followers /following, it's a blank white page. If I try to open a friend's or stranger's profile, it's a blank white page. The app seems to be working fine with calls n messages n timeline/stories. Is there a problem with my mobile, WiFi, I dunt know. I'm having these issues after the latest update.",1
The worst update ever I tried every single name that I can think of to use it as the user name but the √ó@#king Ai won't let me ü§¨ü§¨,1
Not working properly... Recently deleted is not working üòî,1
Some features like music is not available in some account including me... I have tried a lot to make the option available bt waste... Without music I can't even watch reels,1
"Been happily using Instagram for a long time, an it was all good; a few minor annoyances here and there, but it was overall fine. That was the case until the introduction of Reels. Listen, there's a reason I don't have TikTok, it's because I hate the garbage content on that app and want to distance myself from it. How do you think I feel that now that same garbage content is being regurgitated onto my ig feed? Ditch reels, or at the very least have an option to turn it off.",1
"I hated the update! It was trashy. First because I can't change my profile picture, it always becomes a blank and black photo. Right now I don't know how to fix it so yeah, my profile photo right now is a blank black photo. It also crashes a lot. ""Instagram has stopped."" It happened a couple of times and its a bit laggy too.",1
"This app is getting worse and worse by the day. It won't work correctly on my brand new Android. The reels simply won't play when they appear in the feed & profile, stories look stretched after posting when using the music sticker, etc. Filed various reports and no answer. This is just an ad player at this point. Uninstalling.",1
Please add delete all option on interaction menu. Thanks,1
"Always hard to log in it always says ""wait a few more minutes and try again""Ive been waiting forever!",1
"With the latest update, the app always crashes when creating a reel. Sometimes it happens while editing the reel and sometime while the clip is processing. Sometimes after a re-start, it does go further than earlier but inevitably crashes. I have a OnePlus 7(6GB). I never faced issues before. This seems like an memory leakage problem. Please fix this IMMEDIATELY.",1
It isn't opening on my device out of the blue. Having to uninstall and reinstall it multiple times. It has malfunctioned multiple times this year. Dunno what's wrong. It just finally pissed me off today. Edit - Reinstalled the app after going off it for a while and now it's the old version. Dunno what's up with it. Any suggestions would be appreciated.,1
So much bugs...App crash automatically..Too much lagging,1
I can't pause the vidio. Its so annoying.,1
"Very glitchy and bad. Almost unusable for Android users. Much worse then its leading competitors Facebook Snapchat Twitter etc. If I could give it less then one star I would. Whenever I need to post something important. Instagram is always my last choice. Whether iPhone or Android one must prepare themselves for what could only be described as repeated catastrophic failure. Images will not post. The app shuts off on its own. And always, lessens the quality of the item your trying to post.",1
would've been a 5star app if not for the plethora of bugs this app has.. it's like Facebook don't even care anymore,1
Cant get the new features even after updating up to date,1
not only is it an awful app overall but it wont even let me log in into any of my accounts lol,1
"It works well sometimes.. but sometimes it really sucks.. there are so many bugs that need to fix quickly.. like if you use 2 accounts at the same time.. When You update it becomes irritating because it gives only one account the new features and the others are same even after updating the app.. Sometimes it gives so many problems while making reels, like when you post your reels you found your reels plays at double speed and even the quality gets ruined by insta also..",1
"I have been using Instagram for the past few years and have never had an issue with the app. Just recently I have been unable to save posts to a recent folder, I am having to scroll through the folders to find the one I am looking to save it in, as the most recent folder does not appear.",1
Too many advertisement that i make very annoying to follow friend's post,1
"My Instagram reel is not working, and i have reported many times but no action is taken by Instagram team",1
"Similiar experience to one shared here. My app keeps crashing on my Android device. After uninstalling and reinstalling, it keeps taking me in a loop where the screen goes white with the open option. Each time i click open it just goes back to the page. I tried sending a bug report but recieved an error message stating that i should try again later.",1
-Its become weird and weirder to the feeds arrangement in every update- Thats why people get uncomfortable and leave,1
There are only limited sound effects ... please add some more funny effects,1
"Please sort the feed to most recent please ,and allow the search of tags to recent ,why it was removed I don't know .",1
my instagram is disabled without a reason. even my Facebook is disabled because of it.,1
"Can't give follow requests to accounts, it's soo annoying not like the old insta",1
I can't open Instagram üòêat any cost . No number or no email isn't working right now.why?,1
"Glitchy and broken, simply moving a pic from one folder to another completely and irreversibility breaks the app (clearing cach, ect doesn't fix nor does reinstall, which I'm not going to do every single time I have to move a picture). It's just another extension of facebooks advertising platform. This is a problem with how instagram thumbnails work from what I've found in forums and it's part of the core programming so they aren't going to fix it.",1
Hello instagram team I want to tag a post to a collaborator but in my account invite collaborator option doesn't show Please solve this problemüôè,1
"When the notes feature was released I had it, now I don't why did it disappear for me??? Tf",1
I am unable to save the reel in my gallery the option is not showing to save the reel,1
it never ceases to amaze me just how poorly built an app developed by a multi billion dollar company is. There never goes by a day where the app doesnt have some major technical malfunction. One day the feed wont work. The next sending messages is impossible. The same issues every week. And not just this but the UI constantly recieves unecessary changes nobody asks for only making the issue worse. Many similar apps work fine but Instagram after many years still falls short of being stable,1
"Absolute garbage! App never works right, takes forever to upload videos, and constantly tells me about how some music in videos I posted years ago isn't allowed in some countries, so they blocked it, or deleted it, like I really care about it. It's really dumb and annoying. Most of the ads are scams or the product is sold cheaper elsewhere. The fact that you can't share a video to your page, but only to your friend's DM is really stupid.",1
Instead of adding more filters remove all bugs and glitches,1
"All videos posted in Stories appear distorted, skewed, upside-down, and/or pushed into a corner of the screen. Pre-update, all was OK. If it ain't broke, why mess around with it?! Update: all photo effects/filters have now disappeared from Story options. What the hell is happening?!!",1
I can't watch reels and stories I can only hear audios,1
Constantly crashing and won't load latest analytics,1
Very bad experience msgs are not sending and receiving,1
Do not update. This most recent update has all kinds of issues. Can't post. Won't refresh feed. Sometimes the feed is blank. Can't watch stories.,1
In this app my followers are decrease and swip massage and emoji reaction and theme does not work please improve üôè,1
"Bring back the old video format, it's better than turning these long videos into reels, bcs the old one can let you go to the part that you want (you can drag it to the minute u want), and a reel can't do that, u have to watch from the beginning and that sucks. Thank you.",1
"Whenever i load the replies of a comment it's showing replies of another comment,it happens every single time it's sooo annoying that i had to refresh the page to read replies so if there are 10 comments with replies i have to refresh 10 times to read them all and i have a request please enable PHOTO COMMENTS and a option to see top comments means the comments with most likes it doubles the fun of app Edit : i have never seen a app with these many bugs so many that i can't list all of them here",1
"Complete trash. The photo editor has had major issues for over a year now but recently photos just glitch and get corrupted before posting. UI is clunky, cumbersome, ugly. No option to create posts from profile page forcing users back to their feed if they want to post (a desperate ploy for engagement/consumption). 95% of algorithm posts are reels. When viewing 'Following' feed 95% of posts are photos. This proves they're pushing reels and it's not 'wanted' by users. Fix the photo editor!",1
"Would rate zero stars if I could. This new update means that videos autoplay sound on the explore page. You can mute the videos but when you close and reopen the app again they start playing at full volume all over again.. and this is through my phone being on silent. There is no option in settings to disable this feature, it is annoying and no one wants this.",1
My new Instagram 10k followers account was disabled any of the reasons... Many times tried to recover mailed but not active. Username: tajmansuri.official I'm not happy with this app. Guys give a 1 star rating on this app.,1
Note feature is not available even after a month of update,1
"The new updates with the shopping and reels tab where the post and notifications buttons were is not just un-ergonomic, but actively frustrating and counterproductive. The app has also become far more slow after the latest update, and all the posting functions (story, feed post, reels) being filed under one button does not allow Instagram to be used properly. It is a hindrance to all of its users, and frankly , a convincing reason to uninstall and move to a different platform.",1
Its great if you love ads and suggested content.,1
Dear Instagram My Instagram in so many glitch Old Post is not show home page and kuch vidio bhi nahi show ho rhi hai home page par please Instagram short out this glitch in my Instagram üòîüòî üò¢,1
My account is suspended for no reason..when I tried to get back my account Instagram didn't send the code so I tried so many times because of too many request for codes now Instagram saying I have to wait for 24hrs WTH what's wrong with you Instagram why you not resolved your problem on time because of your mistake we user suffer a lot.,1
"SOOO MUCH BUGS IN THE NEWER VERSION like when you edit your video and can't resize so your video is in square. Or when you try uploading photo from your gallery, you can't scroll down until your last photo because the app will prevent you from scrolling (i don't know why you devs make this feature). And when scrolling through explore, the post always snaps itself to the top of the screen, so if you have a video post below, it will start playing, even when you're not seeing it. FIX IT FFS",1
"Not able to upload anything, just saying something went wrong",1
Its not at all working sometimes it is lagging not working properly low post,1
Worst.. can't even react on shred reel...lot of bugs in the app,1
The app doesn't open many a open and I am not able to send voice messages....I at shows that voice message cannot be recorded while recording in other apps but there would not be any other app open other than instagram.....I have tried u installing reinstalling and restarting the device as well....that too not once or twice...have been doing it since 1 to 2 weeks....all so the app keeps showing the message not working.....I at cleared the cache too but in vain...kindly look into the matter....,1
"As an Android user, it frustrates me that after a year the Instagram app makes perfectly normal pictures pixilated. Meta needs to get their act together to fix this, as it shows their supposed high tech and wave of the future ""innovation"" is probably not quite what they promise.",1
"This app was previously (2019 and before) was a great app. Later they started adding weird features like reels , subscription and more. The app contains a lot of glitches and bugs and it is really frustrating. Meta should have not bought this app. Kindly find a good alternative of this app. We will surely find a good competitive in the future.",1
"Terrible, terrible update. Sound automatically interrupts music playback every single time you open the app, and cannot be switched off. Trying to make it look like tiktok and its so irritating to use. The swipe function doesn't work well, the screen is busy and unpleasant to look at.",1
"FIRST OF ALL the home section dedicates to the pages that i chose! I DON'T WANT TO SEE SUGGESTION IN HOME! that thing belongs to explore and it's enough! So i hope they remove this one because i think it's annoying for others too 2nd thing is that removing notification button and changing dm button place with explore button is really annoying I can't find my notifs anymore and the place change is annoying too What's the point of these changes? If y'all don't have new useful ideas, don't update",1
"i can't invite someone to make collaboration with me, but i can do it when I use another account, please fix it",1
"I've used this app for years. No issues. Everything was great. Recently, it started asking me to verify my phone number. A pop-up message would continuously appear and not let me see my feed until I verified my phone number. NO THANKS! üò°üëéüèΩ",1
"When reels played, there's a bug which video jammed for few second, then back to normal., but just for seconds. Then jammed again while the sound is running normally. So basicly there is a gap between video and sound.",1
"Won't let me view my profile so I can see through my videos, it crashes every single time. Won't let me make reels either, gets part of the way then it crashes. I've had to uninstall the app several times. Reeeeeeally frustrating!!!",1
"It's just insane how each update keep making the app worse and worse and user feedback clearly does not seem to have an impact. First of all, why did they have to change the explore page to a reel page? If users wanted that, they'd just download tiktok. Secondly, the whole point of the explore page was to discover similar posts based on interest. The amount of posts I've had to constantly label as ""not interested"" in the hopes that the Instagram algorithm would take the hint clearly doesn't work",1
Experiencing lot of problems...I have uninstalled installed so many times yet nothing is working... unable to watch reels as it get stuck after few seconds...nor I am receiving any message notifications..chat page is also not opening..not able to see any chat...stories are also not loading... How to use the app when nothing is working and opening... Firstly I thought it's some network issue but it isn't..Very Very bad Instagram really disappointed!,1
"For months or maybe for a year I have issues to upload photos in post, because every time it mixed my photos and made a chaos with almost every picture, so for post I needed days because I uploaded 1 by 1, edit and save on the phone and than I tryeded to upload it all together(aditional editing is a problem plus).Also, I report last technical problem 2,3 times and didn't receive any report back or answer or confirmation that I report it etc. Than,sditional editing of pic.in post is not possible!",1
All the time I am posting adverts on my business page @enchantingnaturals and getting it rejected without clear reasons. And then it becomes difficult to delete the ad. Instagram has proved to be a frustrating me o. PLEASE input a feature to readd hidden reels to the public page.,1
"I too cannot see the notes and neither I can write the notes, and while watching reels, it automatically gets frozen, and I have to watch it again, but still, it doesn't work properly, please fix this as soon as possible, and there has been no update since long",1
"The App is not loading anything, the stories, the posts, not even profile. Messages are not loading. I cleared Cache, Data still nothing works. The spinner just keeps on spinning while loading. Not able to logout also. New Update Also Not Working on S22 Ultra. Working correctly on iOS.",1
"Hey, please help me with this problem. I had the 60-second story feature, but the feature went from my account 3 months ago, and I always update the program and it did not return. I hope you return the feature to my account because it helps me. in adding these features",1
"I am not able to watch the reels, the speed of loading reels, pictures or anything has gone slow. My internet is working just superb, like youtube and Facebook are working smooth, but when it comes to instagram, it gives me some hard time of frustration.",1
Worst app ever i have seen in my life . It doesn't work properly. Always glitches and takes loading more than 24 hrs for viewing story and 36 hrs for opening my profile. It takes about 48 hrs for Changing next reels. This kind of app doesn't deserve at Play Store and across the world. Just wastage of installating this app . Its feature gradually decreases on updating version.,1
Way too many adds. This is the worst app I have ever tried to download,1
"Since the previous update uploading videos taken with mobile to reels has basically become impossible since the footage once posted is rotated 90 degrees to the left and hence compressed laterally making it useless to be kept posted. Tried several times with different phones on Android 11 and 9, same result. It's truly disappointing as a content creator that one of the major tools to drive engagement can't be used. If you see this please take a look and fix this issue.",1
Why can't I log into my account? It keeps saying Error try again later every time I try to log in.,1
Y is this new update. It is using more data for 30 mins it is used for 50 % data y is this bluddy update,1
it takes so long time when posted a video on feeds.,1
Not able to create reels So many glitches Oh I'm tired of this camera's problem,1
"I am terribly disappointed with the current update, which made the home feed really unorganized and messy. Not that it is ugly (in my perspective), it is also very crowded and makes it very difficult for me to scroll through. With the new update its also very hard to read the description with all the colors of the reel/picture behind, and takes all the enjoyment from visiting this app.",1
"5times uninstall and reinstall..... Same issues, can't unfollow deactivate account can't follow new ..",1
I can't see anything on my profile or posts from people I follow saved posts are not working either i keep getting a reload,1
"It doesn't work at all. I've had 2 accounts that it just forgot even exist. I go to log in and can't. Try to click ""forgot password"" and it either doesn't load or tells me the account doesn't exist (both when entering username and email). Try to click ""contact us"" and the link is broken. Even ""Sign Up"" goes to a login page, not a sign up page. Every single aspect of this whole platform, on both mobile and PC, is completely broken.",1
Not getting proper updates on time having alot of glitches and bugs,1
Why the heck is Instagram not opening for past several days. Its pathetic. I have uninstalled this ap because of its unusual experience and again install it. But it couldn't open yet. A black screen displayed after Instagram opening logo. Its headache.,1
Time to permanently UNINSTALL Insta(pedophile)gram! Instagram has now joined the left woke pedophile clan! Instagraff is now posting provocative videos of very young (under 11 years old) girls in various 'sexual' poses in skin tight skimpy swimwear! Uninstalled for the last time!,1
I'm unable to load content and messages in Instagram app.,1
Day by day it annoying Because story is not uploading And also lots of issues occur in it,1
"Insta are so useless and impossible to get in contact with whenever there is a problem. I haven't been able to change or update any of my profile information in weeks! It's really hindering my small business! Whenever I go in to edit my profile then try to save it, it'll do the little loading circle but never move forward from there, closing the app doesn't save anything and going back just gives a pop up saying I haven't saved my info "" want to leave anyway?"" üôÑ Nothing fixes it",1
"Everytime you push or pull another update is bringing another lame experience for users. I don't know how you can't fix the same bugs that's been bugging me since the last 15 updates. Whenever I try to view meaning zooming them in or out photos before sending them, it glitches and doesn't allow me to send them. And most of the time when I try and deleting a story, it says there's a problem deleting it from both Instagram and Facebook. So much hardwork for you guys, I know.",1
It's very faustrating for me opening my account and you keep suspending without any act of Crime or something it's crazy,1
"Instagram is really making it difficult for me to post even if I have my data on. Now whenever I'm editing and I have more than 1 photo, it ends up showing the same photo. I reinstalled the app so many times, I don't know what's going on. Now that I was able to post more than 1 picture and I check it again, it's showing the same photos on each slide.",1
Login page not coming I don't know what is wrong but as I download the app and open it i do not get login page to key in details. I have tried uninstalling clear data and every option and installing it but still the login page is not coming Its been a week with this issue please help,1
"IG has stopped working properly for me. It's switched from a light UI to a dark UI when I post photos, which isn't an issue in itself, but the dark UI is incredibly buggy for me: -When I try to resize a photo, the changes never ""stick"" -When I try to rotate a photo, it no longer automatically resizes to fill in the gaps on the sides -Text in stories sometimes look really bad eg. when text bg is selected Also hate that tagging posts automatically sends a DM",1

"It's been almost 1-2 months now, and the Instagram app is still not working. All i get is a blank screen as soon I enter into the app, and it does nothing after it. I've been using Lite, but it's nowhere as close to the original one, atleast make some changes to the lite so it would be on par with the main app. If there was a 0 star option, i wouldve gone for it. Disappointing.",1
Pathetic experience.. even photos not getting uploaded on status..,1
"The new version is totally bad for me as i had experienced the problem with my story. Whenever I add song to my story, it always shows this song is not currently available. I had reinstall the application but the problem was same. I request please sort out the problem of adding song to the story and provide us the much better version.",1
"I can't believe that every time that I want to upload a photo it's take me 1 hour, just a bug after a bug it's impossible to use. The algorithm it's horrible. What's the point of follow hundreds of people if it's only show me 10? Also with publications of a month ago. With every actualization of the app it's just get worst and worst, I think I will leave the app soon.",1
Instagram very big bug is internet speed is ok but offline type work .... application info in force stop after working minutes,1
Quit app when adding photo. My phone is Samsung flip 4. Pls fix.,1
It's time consuming And it's too much addictive Don't waste your time on this ...,1

"What have you done with my favourite app üò≠ I could get over the new look, difficulties with posting pictures, app crashing a dozen times while trying to post a picture, impossibility of changing video format as well as impossibility of saving drafts while opening the app normally, but the shop!! Really? When I saw this today I seriously started to think of deleting my account. This is not a shop, this is unnecessary trash! Can't even hide it. I'm so mad! Hate the new app.",1
Getting increasingly worse on android and less user friendly. For some bizarre reason the update has moved the activity 'heart' button to the top. I would love to know the rationale behind moving the most commonly used button out of reach of the users thumb. It's becoming a 2 handed afair this. If you need to edit the caption the keyboard pops up over the text and you can't scroll to where you need to edit. Why has the straightening grid gone??,1
Instagram reply swipe option does not work and don't update üòëüôÑüò°,1
"For the honest people, great. For scammers & wrong doers, HEAVEN. The biggest problem with that, there's no way to properly report them. You're asked a few simple how-do-you-do's, answer in a multiple choice format that most of the time has nothing to do with the problem & that's it. The fact that some of accounts post pictures of the same pictures, with similar names, just slightly spelled different. I'm surprised Instagram doesn't finds this suspicious at all. That's why I uninstalled it.",1
"After updating my instagram, I can't view video posts and video stories anymore. It'll go lag/freeze if I view it with sound on. The video will keep on loading but I can't see the video at all. My phone will heat up fast when using instagram. The app itself is lag. My internet were great working in other apps but in instagram I can't see any videos at all. Please fix the problem. Thank you.",1
"The app is not loading a single image on the UI. Even my profile pic is not visible. I cannot see stories, or any posts. It only displays a loader. My Internet is working fine as I can download and upload pics on other apps. Tried uninstalling and then installing again. Tried soft and hard reboot. Apart from this the color palette in the story is been overlapped by the keyboard. Devs kindly fix this as it is really irritating.",1
"I'm trying to share an image on insta on chat. It doesn't let me. I get no notifications from instagram unless the app is open in the background. If it's closed, I'll only get to know that I got some messages when I open the app. It's senseless and irritating. I've sent mails and responder via app as well, I've got no response till now. Other than that, a new glitch has occured today. My feed isn't being refreshed ever, shows a network error which isn't the case and doesn't load messages too.",1
"Zero help and support in this app: I can't log into my account from one of my devices and there is absolutely nothing I can do to fix it, no way to contact support or get answers about it. Impossible to use instagram under these conditions.",1
"When I tried opening the account, it is not even showing any option to login or signin. I can able to access anything from last few weeks. I tried clearing datas and cache, uninstalled and installed many times yet no use. Reported to Instagram as well, yet no steps taken. Would be better if they take steps to set all the bugs.",1
"If you notice something on Instagram isn't working correctly, like a broken feature or a technical problem, try updating the app. If it‚Äôs still not working after updating, you can report it to us. Make sure to include as much detail about the problem as possible in your report. Information like the kind of phone or tablet you were using, what you were doing when the problem occurred and adding a screenshot may help us address the issue.",1

"I've been on this app for years now, but ever since I started using dark mode, it starts turning white when I go back to the tab and it's getting frustrating that I need to go out then go back in to have it fix itself back. It's inconvenient when I am messaging someone important things and then I can't see what they sent me. Also fix your algorithm for once and let it stay the best version of itself forever, I have too many friends have lower engagement nowadays.",1
"In privious versions it had a good feature that I could see the preview of stories whitout opening them, specially when you've not been online for a while, but now this feature is gone. That's really bad. Totally last update is an awfull update, especially by adding suggested post to Home. What's wrong with u? If someone wants to see other posts, they simply click on the explore button!",1
worst app ever based no free speech don't ever going to use this as this app favour a particular relgion everytime,1
"Same thing happened to me Re blank screen. Like other ppl mentioned, I cannot open the app about 10 days now. I've tried everything (i.e. uninstalling installing, rebooting my device, erasing app's cache and data, etc) and nothing has changed eversince. I cannot use the app at all. Please fix this asap and inform the users about the malfunction!",1
it is super buggy now. unusable. the security is so bad that my main account got hacked. Instagram support won't help. I am using an alt account but it is having issues on the app. Buggy mess.,1
"This app is getting worst. The adds are more frequent than ever and repetitive. The feed is now filled with recommendations to follow new accounts, even though there is a whole section for this somewhere else. Notifications that recommend to follow accounts, which you can't turn off. As a photographer, I don't do video, but I get penalized because of this.",1
"The new update is terrible, the text on images is really difficult to read and I can't see the image behind the caption (that is unable to be removed). This needs to be changed immediately, I don't understand how Instagram could even think of putting the text over the images. Really basic UX failure.",1
"Generally good but videos uploaded from a Huawei phone look awful, on both feed and story. They lose a lot of definition, shadows and saturation. Really bad for a video/photo centric app. Would give 5 stars but this is so frustrating when the phone takes high quality video only to be compressed into colourless garbage. A lot of people are having this issue üëé",1
"For the last week or so, this app is now glitching for me and not loading. I keep uninstalling and reinstalling, and then it is fine until I close it again. Everything goes blank, can't see videos or pictures, or it just freezes. App was working fine for years until now.",1
SO DISSAPOINTED..üòîüòî Not able to watch any reels or comment of any post . Please fix tha problem ASAP.,1
"If I upload videos, only the first part of the video gets uploaded. The rest of the parts don't. Fix the problem as soon as possible. I have been facing the problem since forever. I do see other users upload videos with multiple parts with ease, but when I do it, mine won't work. Either fix this, or make your videos' duration option longer.",1
"Instagram is not what it used to be anymore. I don't like the reels, shop, and the feed is just full of advertisements. The reels is full of videos from tiktok and I absolutely hate tiktok. My explore page is just full of half naked girls dancing to a song (so cringe). Adverts are okay but if it consumes your feed to the point that it's mostly what you see, is this app even worth using? This is the reason why I have uninstalled it so many times and deleted my previous account.",1
"The latest automatic update is very very annoying. The feeds are like reels/story, it's really difficult to read the caption because the the background is the photo itself, there is no see translation option, and we have to scroll one feed at a time so it took a very long time to see all of the feeds, and it's often lagged and error. So very bad, the version before this is much better. Please make it good again",1
"I was just liking post an they kicked me out my own account because they thought I was using hacks an they thought I got hacked, an I can't do anything about it because I have to change me password but I don't remember it anymore an when I put forgot password it just loops back around to the same thing so now I'm stuck an locked out my own account",1
"Sorry, everyone can visit: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's BLOCK ADS Facebook, YouTube... instagram...Whenever I try to edit or view my highlights on the profile, it gives me an error failed to load highlight and the error ""loading highlight"" gets stuck on the screen while you can navigate to home page or wherever. You have to kill the app to make it go away. If I try adding a new Highlight, it doesn't load any pictures now",1
"Even after reporting the issue multiple times through the app, the issue have still not been fixed. The app doesn't have the collaborator function working (despite having a play store account in a geographical location where it's been released), additionally, can't connect to messenger through the app, thus being unable to reply to specific texts or respond with emojis, change colour etc. Didn't even work using the beta testing program. Very odd. Edit: Still no response after months of chasing",1
Messages inbox were not opening for my account.Please checkout the problem,1
"The new update renders it practically unusable. I can't read post captions or share posts because it doesn't fit on my screen anymore. Besides that, it just looks plain ugly now. What's the point of curating your images only to have a coloured background forced upon you? I've uninstalled twice now to reinstall and each time the old version is back but then the update creeps back in after several minutes even though I've turned off automatic updates.",1
"New update is awful. The full screen mode is difficult to use, hard to see the options such as comments, sharing etc as it gets cut off the screen. Too many videos instead of showing photos. It is not user friendly and so difficult on the user to see/interact with now. Change it back.",1
I had an Instagram update and updated the app last night then my fiance sent me a picture of her face and I can't even save it as when you click on it to save the picture it's a tiny block and you can't even see the words I'm having to guess which one is the save button which is frustrating me. I thought the update was to improve the app not make it worse I'd like this but fixed as soon as possible,1

It's so frustrating that I've given up and refraimed from posting my wildlife photography at all until the issue is fixed, which is disappointing since it's the only platform I share my photos to. Would love to write a positive review when these bugs are fixed.",1
"Absolutely dreadful bug/issues ALL the time. Constantly does not allow you to post your max number of ten photos/vids. Last 48hrs it is worse than hopeless! Hashtags not coming up, even those one uses daily, only allowing one photo or video at a time. Turning ones one video post into a reel! I used to love Instagram and have built up a great following but it's just too onerous and time consuming way too often!",1

"Horrible security. My account got compromised, and the people that gained access were able to: change my associated email, unlink my Facebook, change my password AND enable 2FA without Instabram ever asking me to verify these security changes. Further, my account is full of pictures of my face. The recovery method involves submitting a selfie video, which I did 3 times. IG ""couldn't verify me"" each time. Supposedly it's humans reviewing these videos. I don't think those people give a cr*p.",1

Apparently I can't unfollow as many people as I want because of protection? I've been trying to unfollow people to fix my feed to my likings and all this app knows how to do is blocking MYSELF because of that. Stop with the unnecessary blocking!

"The most insecure app. Anyone can easily take access by some hack tips. No mechanism to revive back the hack accounts, users are harrased having no option to regain access.

"When I click on like, Automatically Instagram tab will close.. I have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times. Same problem I'm facing.. This is the worst experience",1
I am trying to reach out a problem regarding scam happening with so many no action is being taken i have emailed the support team someone else hacking into the account and posting bitcoin credit and messaging from the hacked account to change the credentials pretending to be orginal user of the account.

Had no real problems with Instagram until this morning when it suddenly decided it wasn't going to upload photos anymore. Considering it's basically what I use Instagram for then Mt rating has gone from 5* to 1* as its not for for my purpose.,1

"Dear Instagram, I have been constantly facing issues to have new followers or follow new groups to grow into the parrot community. There is a strange block again today after last week stating that I used paid services to increase followers which is absolutely untrue. Although I changed the password as instructed however the allegation is absolutely baseless. I am not a bot and do not use any paid services. This absolutely absurd and demotivating for a content creator. Worst experience!!!",1

Very invasive. Suddenly asking for my phone number. Trying to force me to use my phone number to use Instagram. Not gonna happen. Not interested does nothing. Group chat keeps crashing despite following all IT procedures.,1
"Won't let me run promotions for my work, keeps saying I owe funds but then won't accept a card of any kind? Facebook says I owe no funds and neither does Facebook app management, worse off you can't seem to report the problem and get a solution or even an answer.",1

What is wrong with this app when i tryto change my username. it doesnt work it's saying that you can't change your name within 14 days i try this so many times.so i report the problem but it doesnt work i only give one star to this app,1
Harder and harder to find photo content. Instagram has ruined the app by going bonkers for reels. If they put a way to block reels I'd pay for it at this point.,1
My Instagram is not working from a long time I have been trying to open the app but it gives a white screen whenever I opened it ... I reinstalled it but that also didn't work. Help me,1
I can post 1 minute story without cuts only once. But i received the notification that i no longer need to cut my story that longer than 15 seconds. Do you guys want to keep the feature or not? Really pissed me off.,1

"I like this app but sometimes I can't post and story even my wifi is no problem idk I'm so stressed when it's strat to happen, Instagram need to update clearly please do your work!!!!",1
"I use this app very often, but the update sucks it only shows a white screen I tried installing it again but it's not working. You guys need to fix this ASAP!",1
On start shows logo screen then white blank screen. Other Instagram app works but when browsers demand openning in app this useless heap of scrap is what it wants to open in. Utterly pointless in current state,1
I am not able to see my feed page also not able to see my followers and for that iam not getting any support. Many time so much issue in using insta. Is this technical glitch or insta dont want to do continue me to use this app.,1

Please fix the glitches it's literally been years since that dark mode glitch where portions of screen goes white and it hasn't been fixed yet. It seems as if they're not even trying.,1
Whatever update was recent all of sudden any account I have blocked is now showing back up & no matter what I do of unblocking and reblocking it still shows up. There is a reason why I blocked them and didn't want to be seeing those accounts.,1
Bad I cant create reels be cause they're always glitching and when I make a mistake want to start over creating the just comes out without me taking it off ...it bad I wish this could be fixed cause I like Instagram,1
"Sometimes it shows black or white screen and does not reopen. I'm suffering from this problem only. I hv downloaded insta app 10 times in 3 days but the problem hv not solved. So, pls try to solve out my problem insta id - itz_naman06x . I'm currently using insta lite which hv very low features .",1
My insta is not working properly from last 2days... it's lagging alot and it's always buffering even if the wifi is high... please look after this issue so that i can use Instagram,1
"Similar to others having the same issue, everytime I go to even open the app, the meta logo appears, and then turns into a blank black screen.",1
"Thought this app was supposed to be for PICTURE sharing not a tiktok copycat. Changes have been terrible for artists, it's now impossible to get engagement without creating a reel.",1
"Having problem with reels, reels of other people that i watch often stuck in half and not played completely even after restarting the reel for sevral times please fix this bug.",1
App hasn't been able to open since the 19th. It seems that Instagram does not care about this since many others are experiencing the same thing I am and yet still no fix from Meta. Trash company.,1
After I download the app it went blank. What should i do? I thought it is an entertainment app but it turns out as stressful app. Kindly fix it. I am already outdated about the idols i followed. Fixed it now!! Pleeease.,1
"As a newbie as a blogger on Instagram ive noticed that it considerates everything as a spam. We cannot follow people, we cannot give feed back to our new followers or say thank you on the comments. No standard messages at all. We cannot like stuff either. As a blogger we must to provide content specially at begging but apparently Instagram only cares about millionaire accounts. It is impossible to reach anything. Trying to find another plataform for my business.",1
Awful app great platform..but... I left Facebook for this?ü§î. My app goes into a blank screen everyday and I'm not able to see anything. It's so very unfortunate for personal and business reasons. Please fix soon!,1
Need to improve a lot ...After each update it's getting worst...can't able to upload a full video of more than 15 sec it's automatically divide into 2 or 3 parts as per it's length,1
I'm facing white screen problem since one week. I've already reported nd no action has been taken. This is very disappointing. I'm not going to use insta ever again now. Worst app ever.,1
"The new direction Instagram and Fb are going are alarming, all you see are syggested reels and posts by people you don't care about while missing everything from people you care about, plus the inexistant reach that made creating and posting pointless and not worth the effort... IG Sinking ship and can wait for an alternative to show up",1
"it's been working just fine until the other day. i reinstalled it, deleted it, restarted my phone and everything and it's just a white screen! i can't even log in !!",1
Instagram is terrible bee trying to login to my account nd no joy what so ever and it linked to my Facebook but bringing older email that I can't access to reset password. Can't get help anywhere so poor and can't speak to anyone!!,1
Instagram is absolutely terrible at helping with hacked accounts. I have sent them numerous emails and evidence about my hacked account and all my friends have reported it but Instagram just sits back and let's the hackers scam more and more people. Instagram does not even reply to emails.,1
help its been weeks since i cant use this app anymore. it just shows a blank white screen. i tried clearing caches and data yet it still doesnt work. ive uninstalled and installed it for 4 times already yet nothing has happened. i hope u guys fix this,1
why are yall changing the vid format to reels???reels should be reels and vid post should stay like tht....why keep updating and change unnecessary stuff??this isnt tiktok no need to make this app similar to it...srsly i used to love Instagram but after all the updates....my Instagram keep having bugs and lags and the vid quality is getting worse and worse,1
"Hey, I don't know what's going on. I can't access the app every time I go into the app, it shows me a white background.I deleted the app, then installed it over and over again, and I deleted the cash and the data, but it's useless. Please fix this or tell me what to do, and thank you.",1
"I cannot even make a post after editing all my 10 pictures. It either glitches them out by stretching them or it just absolutely dies and shows an error on the screen saying ""there has been an error and it has been reported to Instagram"". Also when swiping through the edited photos prior to posting, I would swipe to see my next photo but then the app would go to a completely white screen and then take me back to my feed. No draft was made or anything & I had to spend all that time editing again.",1
Instagram is being very weird Where Instagram light is working perfectly fine,1
"Getting CONTINUALLY frustrated with Reels! Sometimes the option to make them 60secs appears, but 80% of the time the max time is 30secs. Then when I'm making it, 70% of the time, it will freeze up - and I need to begin all over again! ü§¨ Not happy that sometimes the text I add onto Reels gets stretched out or squashed AFTER I've uploaded it. I also wish there was a way to download a Reel WITH the music so I can upload it onto Facebook!",1
"I loved the app and I've been using the app for many years with no problems but now all of a sudden it just freezes or shows a black out screen, and well it won't even show my friends storiesüôÅ It's either the new updates have messed up my Instagram experience or probably your app doesn't really cater for android devices üôÅ Please help fix this problem because it's really so annoying and if I could half a star I would if the option was there. ! Not happy at all üôÅ",1
"I have been trying to create an account for hours now. The app collapses, and then when I try to resume the process, it doesn't allow me to sign in saying that my account is disabled for not meeting their terms. Now I have multiple user names from multiple email addresses, it wouldn't even sign me in through Facebook. The app is messed up.",1
App is not refreshing...not working properly,1
Nowadays Instagram sucks seriously because the draft reels are disappearing without loging out which is frustrating. I work entire day for creating video and at the end of the day those videos are disappearing,1
"New user, I cant log in to my acc, its bounded on my facebook, i dunno why but its giving me a hard time.",1
I'm super annoyed. The vids in the news feed are always muted and you have to press on them to unmute while you do so the vid is halfway through and you can't rewind it or stop (most annoyin when i have to read cool for deaf ppl) so i must waste my time rewatching it. The second is stories. The app collapses in the middle of making stories. If I close the app for a sec i am sure the stores that I'm making and not finished yet will be gone cos the app reloads completely. Same with the news feed.,1
Delay and feed loading too late and too many scam and full of fake and scamming adds and delays in story updation.,1
"Tf is wrong with you developer, we do updates to get good performance rather then getting our account get deactivate all by itself. This is really irritating, cannot even log in despite doing all the stuffs. I have lost my account and you developer are the one to be blame. Such a hoe behaviour. I care less to the slang I've type because you deserve it üò°ü§Ø",1
I don't like the latest update. The layout change doesn't make sense to me and Instagram stories are buggy and sometimes don't load properly. Edit: I also realized that you took a way a bunch of useful features which makes bo sense. The insights are pretty much pointless now ans they don't tell me any useful information. Also the feature to save posts after writing the caption and stuff. You're just making the app worse at this point.,1
The worst thing I ever downloaded It's full of glitches and bugs Honestly it's trash and overated,1
"With every new update rolling out, this is becoming a trash. It lags, doesn't function as intended and crashes often. Moreover, it automatically turns on the sound when an ad shows up. Really frustrating. [Updated: It isn't letting me upload anything on feed or story and keeps me waiting on ""processing upload, will upload when possible"". This technical issue has also banned me from uploading any further photos. This is another worse experience with Instagram.]",1
"Totally disappointing how much the app has changed. Every 4th post is an ad. Explore page is just videos of the same recited audio track over and over again from tiktok that gets annoying and over done after 20 times. I get people want to make their own version of each trending video but I miss when instagram was all about photos. Seeing lje through another's eyes. After all, a picture says a thousand words. More unique and not as repetitive that way.",1
"So, first of all, kudos to the team for making the overall performance of the application very slow. There have been times where I want to send an important text to a customer from my business account but the texts won't go till 2 or 3 minutes. There have been times when the app Won't respond and simple say ‚ÄúNetwork Error‚Äù at crucial times when you want to unsend a text. These are just some of the qualities that make Instagram one of the the worst application in PlayStore.",1
Instagram been glitching out these days. Nothing loads even though my connection is good. I don't know how many times I have to uninstall and re-install to get the app working normally. Please fix this problem. Edit: I wish I can rate 0 stars. I have uninstalled and reinstalled more than 10 times in just 3 days. This is getting EXTREMELY ridiculous!!,1
"Instagram camera keeps flickering in my phone LG G8X ThinQ , tried all hacks to fix still does'nt work",1
fix your video call. the screen always goes black,1
The pushed content is overwhelming! I cannot find posts from the people I actually choose to follow.,1
"all these random, unnecessary updates are driving me crazy. they are so weird",1
"I am very unhappy, when I deactivated my account, I lost 2 photos. I sent a report but it still hasn't been resolved, for months, the photos have not been recovered. Also, I can no longer view my story or any other stories on the app for some strange reason. I need to get the bug fixed, Instagram do something please.",1
I don't get confirmation code from Instagram while verifying or login in to account why pls clear this bug,1
"This is my one of the fev app. But they temporary block account not for any reason. Even I report them about the problem, still no change. That's why they disappointed me",1
"I cannot use this app, I have to use the website , the error is that this app can't be used in English united Kingdom and it doesn't work with US too. What should I do? Getting worse and worse,even the new update doesn't work. üò°üò°üò°",1
"I have two accounts which are linked, my phone was formatted so I had to reinstall the app. I can't get into one account but can't get into the other and they are linked. I can't use the same password that I know and when I try resetting, Instagram sends the code to a Brazilian number! I have sent a message via my other account for help and no response. Its very frustrating! You would think an app as big as this would have an efficient helpline. I'm locked out of my account! Help!!!!",1
I gave 3 star because it can't update my messenger due to which i can't reply any important messages . Instagram need to improve it.,1
I don't know what's going on I have a problem with messages taking time to be sent and not reaching my phone I really don't understand,1
"I can't post anything to my feed or my story - I select a picture from my camera roll, click next, and then I get a ""Loading..."" message that doesn't go away. This is a new problem within the last 24 hours. I also want to comment that the ads/recommended similar posts are out of control - 2 out of every 5 posts are an ad or recommended. Ridiculous.",1
I have auto update off. But somehow Instagram has access through facebook to the systems rights and can update regardless. If you're going to force me to update at least release a version that doesn't crash before I can even open it. It's been almost 4 days since I have been able to use the app. Get it together.,1
"the links given in bio are not opening , plus all the links given in story are also not opening , they have loading error facebook logo comes writen below we are trying to fix this error",1
First the viewers list and now the following tab is gone. If you want to protect the privacy you could have added more privacy features. But these updates have made the app very boring. Might stop using it after sometime as it's not interactive as it was before. The contents have become very limited and repetitive and we can only see the post of the pages and people we follow. Since the following tab is gone there is no new content to explore. Get this fixed.,1
Not showing the updated version after updating also.,1
Just don't like this app I updated it so many time but it is showing the old instagram,1
Hello Instagram owner im using business account and I post 68 video but are many more videos but are not commut views in my video ...name-innocent boy shubham,1
"Using this app has never been more frustrating especially when editing reels in the app!! If I create 4 reels 1 of which will turn out fine but the rest will be either blank black, captions glitching ruining the reel, app glitching resulting in it shutting down 9 times out of 10 and so many more frustrating things that I don't expect from an app that is trying to beat its ""competitors"". Unbelievable. Update: My account was disabled with no warning for sharing LGBTIQ+ art. This app is just...",1
"I can't open the app. Every time I press it, it just goes blank like a white screen. You will only see the logo for 3 seconds then it will disappear and be stuck on the white screen. I'm annoyed because no matter what I do, I can't open the app. I reinstalled still nothing happened. I cleared data still nothing. I'm using Instagram Lite right now and I don't like it. Can you please fix the app as soon as possible? Thank you!",1
"I just reinstalled app for like three times and it isn't really working. I am not able to react to messages and reels option isn't shown in the feed . And my camera isn't showing exact ratio of the picture .it's more elongated and thinner . Edit: And now everything is really messed up , my like and message option are exchanged and it looks gross. And can't find my reel option.??! Please , fix all these glitches that happen. Today my friend tagged me in a video and it wasn't showing up ....",1
"I use IG for messages mostly. DM notifications do not work. I have to load into the message room and sometimes it will load the new message sent to me. (Updating doesn't fix this issue)(Yes, my notifications are turned on) The app loads invasive targeting advertising every second post, and I can't block enough advertisers to try and see my friends posts. Terrible application.",1
"New reels-centric layout is horrendous. Trying to read more on the caption is near impossible, or see all of the text of the reel since it's covered by the minimised caption. I can't even get to the comments or send via dm bar since it'll take me to the next post if I try scroll down a little to view the buttons. I didn't even have auto-updates on but this is by far the worst update Instagram has ever released. Why fix something that was never broken?",1
My saved music can't show me that's bad I'm reporting 100 of time but instagram team can't help of my this problem,1
It seems like I'm not the only one having this Blank black screen when loading up the app. Had recently deleted insta for personal purposes and had redownloaded it only for it to have a blank load up. Guess this is a sign that the Devs dont care about fixing this issue since it's been 3 weeks. Either revert the version to when it was working or update us about the fix.,1
"instagram was the go-to photo sharing app all over the world, but emphasis on ""was."" instagram has been trying so hard lately to become something that it is not (e.g. tiktok, shopping app??(?)). it would be better if it went back to the good old days of just photos and stuff, and the reels can go in its own separate section ALONE. by that, i mean no reels in the feed‚Äîreels in reels section only. Furthermore, please bring back the chronological timeline.",1
Other person not able to hear my voice messages. Please fix it,1
Trash!! The app just opens to a black screen. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and also restarting the device as well...tried reporting to Instagram but no response!,1
"I don't want to receive notifications from the accounts that aren't signed in! The button for deleting follow requests is too small and inconvenient. I send a follow request then refresh the page, but it doesn't show that the follow is requested. A like on a story disappears. Can't press mute/unmute button on videos, change the category of a saved video, because of a line, it's very annoying! How can someone like my story without being in the list of the story viewers?!",1
"Awful experience if you don't have an iPhone. Videos are compressed within an inch of their life, photos in stories have a life of their own and change size and pick and choose if a filter takes effect. Adding a gif is like playing russian roulette, is it going to work? Is it going to remove my filter? Is the app going to crash? Unbelievably frustrating experience this app is barley usable at the moment",1
"When I download a reel's video, it's uploaded backwards, what's wrong?",1
"If you have the black screen issue, search up parallel apps. On Android, it's usually in settings but it can different for iOS.",1
"This update is disgusting. I absolutely hate it. I do not care at all about reels or whatever that shopping thing is. Moving the notifications and button to add new posts is incredibly frustrating and I hate that they're not at the bottom and accessible from any page now. Disgraceful update, the app just became so annoying. Please for the love of God fix it!!",1
"For the past week, everything has been stuck at a ""loading"" phase... I can't view anything on my feed, Can't post or upload IG story, can't even reply or react messages. I don't know what happened, it just won't load properly as it did before. At first I thought it was my internet connection, but my connection was fine, so I've log in and out several times, even had to uninstall and reinstall to see if it works.. but nothing worked. Please fix this bug or glitch üòì",1
"Instagram keeps joking with the selection of the photos I do... It's a bug that's present for a long time and I've spent already too much time selecting photos I want to post, applying color corrections, adding some context and then app mixes up the order or uploada multiple same photos instead of the ones in the order I selected. This is a serious issue and could not be more annoying. I haven't been adding much posts lately due to that reason. I have to retry multiple times before any success",1
"Great app, but after recent update its not opening.",1

Can't make a video for my story longer than 30 seconds without severe lag. Didn't the newest update allow users to post video stories for longer than the standard 40 seconds? I suppose that's just for the apple users ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,1

It's been a week i am inserting my birthdate & it shows me same error message: ""try again""! It neither enters my account nor remains quiet to let me use my device!

"messages doesn't load unless i refresh manually, unable to send messages with the tap and hold share feature, app crashes. Please improve your app on android.",1
It's alright. Still better than Facebook but the ads are ridiculous and I honestly wish they'd get rid of the square format for photo uploads.,1

"Was not showing my photos from my gallery when I tried to make a post. After a few days, I tried reinstalling and now it won't let me login, login with Facebook, or reset my password. Irritating.",1

It won't let me upload any pictures to my page. It only shows pictures that are backed up in my cloud. Very frustrating for my business page.,1
"Iam unable to react to any message and I cannot replay to the message. I will only get like option when someone send me any message. And one more problem is I cannot scroll the reals, if I see one reel I cannot see the next one also.",1
When I open the app I can't see anything cause it's pitch black and It did not working properly I don't why I thought it's just a lag or anything else and I just uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it's the same thing happened,1
The platform is ok but their security team is a bunch of morons. Blocking an account for using different IP addresses. No one is sitting in one spot all the time with a static IP. People move around and we use VPNs where the whole idea is to change IP address. The platform allows sex and crypto ads and violent images but I can't change my IP address. Who's the meta imbecile who came up with that idea?,1
Please fix the app on Samsung. A black screen shows up whenever you start the app and no amount of reinstalling/ redownloading has worked.,1
"The latest update is trash. I can barely see anything I've actually followed. It's mostly suggested posts, and the suggestions are awful, nothing I have the least bit of interest in. This is basically a useless app now.",1
"One minute It updates to longer than 15 sec vids on IG story..... Next minute its back to 15 second ones with no warning. Why does it do this day to day. Same goes for messaging. New version, then back to old. Whenever it feels like it",1
"Ever since I updated, my gallery won't showmy most recent pictures to upload. Ihave to click on other to see my most recent pictures. This means I can upload multiple pictured at one time either.",1
Won't work. Keeps on saying something about a fail load or something. Don't know what wrong with it but I can't do anything on it without the fail load message showing up.,1
I have updated this app but still I can't reply to any messages or like the message with any other emojis except love (‚ù§Ô∏è) .My friends can do this all in their insta but I can't in mine. Why? I request the authority to fix this problem ASAP please.,1
I have just joined Instagram and messenger update was missing. Really unhappy because many features are missing for my account. Have reported the problem too but still unanble to get any response. Hoping for a response soon from Instagram..,1

"My Instagram feed, stories and DMS all aren't working. I can't open anyone's post, niether receive anyone's dm nor see stories on my feed. My account tab on bottom right is working fine. I can see my posted posts, but I can't see nothing apart from that",1
"I have an issue. If I mention some of my friends in my story, they can't repost it in their story. I alreday turned on the story sharing option. Is this a glitch? Please tell me the solution for this or solve this problem.",1
I've uninstalled and re installed it over 4 times today and it still wont load at all nothing will. And I have good connection all of my other online apps work fine but Instagram doesn't work at all.,1
"Like many others, my app has not been working for at least a week now. Really irritating, since my business uses this platform daily. Nothing loads, tried on numerous wifi spots. This is an android device",1
I can just give one star this app is sucks they blocked my acount and now i can't even login to my acount. not only did they close it they also blocked my acount and my poste about 200 pics. They dont even give me a chance anymore to delete my pics. I would not recomend anyone this app it sucks and is worst than all the other app like it.,1
"I am not getting proper views on my reels...I've reported about it so many times....but didn't get a single response from Instagram,very bad, Why my video is not uploading? Everytime i am getting same message...we restrict for community guidelines..... in Every video I've mentioned the credits & Disclaimer then what is the problem?.... i want to know..... why you are doing this to me Every time....I've reported this problem many times but didn't get a solution.... didn't even get a single reply",1
The app was lagging and I kept on getting kicked out. I then came to the appstore and there's a new update. I went ahead an did their update and the app is still lagging and crashing.,1
"In stories- A video with duration 30 sec is automatically cut to one story with duration 15 sec only (without 2nd part from 16 to 30 sec).Android 9, Samsung galaxy s8+. The same problem with Galaxy s21fe!",1
"Instagram used to be a nice app. Now I only have suggested reels on my feed, it's like being on TikTok, and I don't even see what the accounts I follow post anymore. And obviously people following me don't see my post neither, the number of likes I get on my posts dropped from an average of 250 likes to 50-60 now. I personally don't care about likes, I just feel bad for artists, musicians, etc., using the app as a way to promote their work and make a living. Please do better.",1
"Problem, > Instagram music not available in your region",1
"Disruptive adverts, videos, more adverts, reels, etc, all play automatically, unmuted, with no option to spare your eyes and ears. So, you have to either scroll with your device muted and unmute it for videos you're interested in, or listen to half a second of random advert noise every third post. I think they've actually removed the option to turn off autoplay. Classy.",1
"nothing is working well anymore: when you scroll on a person's profile and click on a specific picture and exit, it takes you back to the top of the profile. videos sent from my or another's person gallery have no sound. one-view videos sometimes don't load despite having a good connection and i have to restart the app in order to view them. instagram has gotten so much worse since facebook bought it and it somehow keeps getting worse with each update and no one is doing anything about it.",1
"Hate it. Impossible to work out how to do things and can never find out how to do some things, like post a text story - without a photo!!!!! Absolutely ridiculous.",1
"This app used to be great is a lie, it was never great. I've said this problem enough times but it has never been addressed, I'm not on any beta program of any kind, so why is it that my Instagram is the only different one, the activity tab is replaced with the shop tab, and it's moved to the profile tab right beside the menu. If I reinstall the app everything goes back to normal, but once you guys release an update, even though I've not updated it yet, it reverts to being different, fix this.",1
Logs me out and won't let me back in! Extremely annoying as I have to reset passwords for all my accounts each time this happens. Wth instagram?? Why you do that? Do you want to lose people???,1
"the notes feature is not available on my account till now, i dont know whether it is a bug or something else. hope Instagram respond to it asap!!",1
"The app has started showing the same photos over and over again on my explore pages. I've tried hiding them by saying not interested, but when I refresh the page I just get the same photos again greyed out with a slashed out eye icon. It's ruining the Instagram experience when I am seeing the same content constantly.",1
Not giving the option of login a account it is not working well,1
"The last update is the worst. I HATE the way they transformed the feed, a bunch of reels with white on white text, impossible to read. It's full of bugs, e.g the buttons to like, comment and send are always hidden and I have to enter the profile, look for the photo and then I can view the buttons. I really really hate this app rignt now, it's a bad copy of tik tok and I don't need two apps that do the exact same thing. I'll delete Instagram until they bring back the old feed.",1
Wanted to give it a higher rating until just recently when it basically became an advertisement app. I see an ad after every third post in my feed. I watch an add every time I swap to someone else's story. I get an ad when I just browse recommended. I'm ok with seeing an ad once in a while but given how many I see them throughout the day on a single platform just became annoying and completely ruined my experience.,1
Every day regularly this app send me an error as a notification (the Instagram has been stop) And I have to uninstall again update and sigh in What's wrong with Instagram team!!!!!!,1
To Instagram team. I can't add description in my post please fix this problem as soon as possible .,1

Unable to upload stories . Kindly please resolve the issue . Thank you üòä,1
"New update killed it. Can't even make posts without the app closing right as I try to go ahead and post the pics. Once it closes, all the work I did finding the photos to post is lost. It's completely unusable for me now. Taking away drafts also made no sense. What a dumb move. This app progressively gets worse. Used to be my favourite.",1
The worst app I ever have found.... How can u ban our accounts without any reason or warning. Unban the account u have banned as quick as possible !!,1
"My Account got hacked, I have tried all possible ways to recover my account but it's more than impossible to recover it, Support system of instagram is useless, I have been mailing them from long time but no response neither they are deleting the account after been reported by multiple users, Please guy's don't upload your photos in instagram if you are a private person,it can get hacked anytime, Instagram Team doesn't help you",1
Bad experience....am not able to open the post shared ..... neither the accounts shared to me.....pls work over it...

1 star cuz of only one simple issue. On my account cross app messaging isn't enabled. Bored with the old Instagram messanger. Can't able to react n reply:(. I have reported this to Instagram several times but they didn't even replied to me . Please Instagram reach out to me. I also want these new cool features on my account.,1
"I'm looking for an alternative to IG. Once Facebook (Meta) took over IG it's become a rubbish app. No chronological order of your stream, served up rubbish plus ads and a constant video stream. IG is trying to become Tiktok. If you haven't got an account, do yourself a favour and don't sign up for one. If I could give this app a thumbs down or a zero score I would.",1
"I have to uninstall and reinstall every 8 hours or so, to avoid the buffering, gray screens and blank screens. If I had a dime for every time I cursed Instagram for buffering, I'd be rich.",1
Worst experience ever.After the recent update my original account got suspended without any fault of mine & now I'm unable to recover it since I'm not getting the recovery code via sms. Then Just after creating a new account it also got suspended and the same trouble started. Before this last update it was good. But now WORST APP EVER.HOPE THIS APP GETS BAN AND DOES NOT EXIST AT ALL.,1
Terrible app. It amazes me the info they take and share in their agreement. Also why is it like going through a maze to find the delete account option and then you have to wait 30 before they believe you truly want to delete your account?,1
"I was trying to share a reel and I didn't like the way the video looked, so I kept deleting & uploading it, and now IG won't let me share videos because they think I'm a bot.. I have already sent them messages regarding my issue but they haven't replied. üëéüèº",1
Useless app to many rules should loosen up on showing your body. The human body is art.,1
"Hectic lagging lately, switching accounts also is a problem. Everything takes ages to load, checked my Internet it is working fine and as usual. So whats the problem? It has been happening for a while now and it's getting more and more annoying",1
My country is supported and I have the latest version of the app but still don't have the messenger update.,1

"Unable to use the app for several weeks. I receive an ""Instagram keeps stopping"" alert when I try to open. Uninstalled and cleared cache several times. Help would be appreciated. EDIT: over one year later and the app still does not work. I have not gotten it to work since May of 2021.",1
"It was fine until recently. I can no longer upload more than one photo, and the gallery doesn't show me anything except what I've already uploaded to Instagram. My feed is full of more reels than actual images, and it's frustrating to see how much this app is changing.",1
"App is broken!! Started with not being able to add an account, probably had other things wrong too but I didn't post on my personal account regularly. Then I uninstalled the app, foolishly thinking that would help, and instead all I get is a black screen when the app loads. Nothing else. I've tried everything, as has everyong else. Please fix this! I need this for work!",1
This app keeps getting worse. Too many suggested posts and repeated posts from weeks ago. Bring back chronological order!,1
"My timeline and DM is not working and not showing. I tried opened with lite, web version, and suprisingly it doesnt work too. That is only happened with my account, when i tried to switch account, everythings is work perfectly. But not with my account. I send a bug report, but you guys is never response. I'm so dissapointed.",1
UPDATE: it's July 31st and the app STILL doesn't work. UPDATE: It is now July 17th and I still don't have access to the app! The latest update as of June 30th: I can't log into Instagram. I click the app and a blank white page pops up. Meta flashes for like 1.5 seconds at the bottom and I'm back to looking at a blank page. I have a Samsung 10. UPDATE: It is now July 8th and I still cant access my Instagram! I use this app to promote to my clients.,1
"Why isn't it working from past 7 days ... whenever I try to open it , i can see nothing but a black screen... I've tried uninstalling and reinstall it again, turning the device off and everything. I waited that i thought it was a server down...but I've waited enough 7 days now you need to solve with this issue it was really disgusting!!",1
"My god, every single update only manages to make this app worse. I had to update because the app kept crashing, and that somehow made it so that I was only allowed to choose from 3 images in my gallery to post. If I wanted to post multiple images at once, I flat out could not. Uninstalling/reinstalling has given me my gallery back (yet changed the layout again????), but instagram is, has been, always will be an absolute mess.",1
"Absolutely bursting with adverts, to the point where I was about to delete my account due to barely being able to see the content I actually wanted to see because of how many adverts there was. I then realised I was using the app so uninstalled it & went back on my browser which barely has any so is a far nicer experience. In summary: This app is beyond shite.",1
"This app hasn't worked well in months. Various filters or photo editing selections distort photos upon uploading. Reels have taken over the site and your ""newsfeed"" is mostly suggested reels or users you ""may"" like instead of people you follow. Very frustrating to use especially when compared to it's competition.",1
"Hate this F'in bug. First, it was just the app not letting me log into my other accounts; which made me reinstalling it.. WRONG MOVE!! The app won't ever open when i did. It only showed a black screen, and that's all to it. I've tried clearing cache, clear info same with the play store. I also tried using data instead of wifi, even restarting phone, downloading a random apk online üíÄ, and countless of redownloading over and over. Fix your app please.",1
"Deleting the app until you stop dropping the quality of my photos at upload. I'm lucky if they even come out without a 45 degree skew the first time. But even then, they're always like 12 pixels. This platform is how I journal my life. It's very important to me. And given how much screentime I give you in return, I expect more than a greeting cards worth of storage space. And the horse you rode in on.",1
"Just a buggy mess. Can not send reels to friends at all. When I send a reel to someone it just shows a little arrow and you can't send any message after, because your previously sent reel is stuck now with the little arrow so I have to wait till the message pops up ""couldn't deliver try again later"" and then the rest of the messages go through.. What a horrible experience ugh..",1
I'm using Honor 9n. Version 9. The reels and high quality video is getting buffer. App crash randomly while watching reels. Hanging frequently. I'm facing bad experience with this. I cleared cache but no use of it. Still facing the issue,1
"There are so many glitches in the app. Earlier the audio page on reels was added automatically. Now I'm unable to add it even if I use the saved audio page. It just doesn't show. It's so frustrating, I've tried re-uploading as well.",1
Long time user of your app. But the last 3 weeks my inbox on my bookstagram isn't working. It says I have messages but they don't load. It looks like I sent a message but then it disappears later. Have no issue on my other instagram account. Sent a issue report and no response. I have cleared the cache I have deleted the app. The app is up to date.,1
"So many glitches and errors updating. I kill this app frequently to reboot it and get it to work properly for a bit longer. Also, Instagram is trying more and more to be tictok. Sadly their algorythm is pretty horrible. So it's tough to watch them fail so badly that it pushes me and others out of the app. Fix #1 allow users to set their feed to: ""Following only, chronological""",1
"The messenger area always glitches to where you can't look at chats or groups you're in, and it's been happening to other people as well. This, along with pleny of other social media sites, have been going downhill rapidly and it's pathetic.",1

"I've been using this app for years. Never in my life have I seen an app with this many bugs. First off, I can't even save pictures on insta I have to post them to my story to save them. Alot of my story archives just say December 31st, 1969. And I've had posts taken down wrongly but you'll let girls promote their nudes/lewds. I literally just post myself, my bf, and my cats. It feels like yall don't like your users. EDIT: Yall just took a feature away from me. I'm a public account. I'm so fed up",1
Edit. After giving feedback and reporting still haven't received the update. Original review was of October Unable to use reaction emoji and themes during a chat... Tried giving feedback and reporting it but that feature is of no use.,1

"IG demanded an updateüôÑ The reels thing is a nightmare, sorry, not sorry. I had to post and delete my most recent reel THREE times because of the different glitches (video+sound did not match up;text got stretched;video quality was compromised).

Nothing loads anymore. Cannot see profiles or get messages. I have Uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail.,1
"I used to use it all the time but now whenever I open the app everything is black except my profile picture and it says 'can't refresh feed'.

"eeeeeeek I don't like how you mixed videos and reels as one! üò† You kept messing up with curated feeds (and cover photos) because you guys keep doing big stupid updates. Videos are even more important than reels! Instagram is for photos and videos, and you're trying too hard to be like Tiktok. It's getting harder and harder to be creative on this platform.",1
Very bad experience.. The developers doesn't take care of their users interests... I've reported for so many times for getting the reply option but they doesn't.. New accounts have reply option but me and one of my best friend doesn't have reply option. We both have reported for so many times.. But their is no action.... Worst app...,1
"RECENT NEW BUG/ISSUE: Despite my Settings made to allow anyone to DM me (I am an artist that does commissions so new ppl DM me often) for over a week now, some ppl are now, not able to do so and have been getting messages staying that: ""you cannot message this user because they do not follow you"". This is new and utterly ridiculous. I have spent over a week trying to research a way to fix this glitch and apparently I am not the only one with this issue. And no clear solution in sight.",1
"It's trying to be every social media app all at once, & these freaking updates after updates is for the birdsü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, & I dont know if it's just me but my feed is filled with unwanted pointless videos and pictures that I'm not familiar of seeing & when I tried to update it, it's still the same. & when I look through my personal feed, the pictures & videos I see is a day old, & when I refresh it I see more photos & videos from a few days ago, knowing the fact that the people I follow are active.",1
"I recently logged out of my account on accident and I wanted to log back in but it's just a black screen. I uninstalled and re-installed the app and when I try to open it, it's still a black screen. Instagram needs to fix this bug asap. I reset my phone, I've done everything possible and it still doesn't work.",1
"Instagram is not what it used to be. Although apps need to change and be tweaked over time to keep up with the times, Instagram has become slow, dull, won't let me correctly upload pictures and I really dislike seeing follow suggestions appear on my news feed as though I already follow that specific content. Just a plain poor job and a hassle to something that used to be easy, fun and simple, thanks meta.",1
"This app decides to permanently delete my account with no rhyme or reason. I couldn't even access customer support as they decided to automate everything, and made it so I can't even appeal a ban. When I was provided not one actual reason of what I did wrong.",1
You're trying to edit a picture or draft and it messes with everything. And let's not talk about the freaking shopping and suggestions and bots that invade the app constantly.,1
"Stop giving me multiple suggested reels bands and give me back my recent stories! I just want to see my friends stories real quick :/ ALSO why I can't see comments on a post?? Edit 2 : I drafted a very nice video hoping to post it later BUT THE DRAFT BUTTON SUDDENLY DISAPPEAR ALONG WITH ALL MY VIDS, I LOST MY VIDS, THANKS",1
Whenever I come to reply to a chat I don't have the reply option! I don't know why all my friends got the option except for me and my WiFi is fine but I don't know why the app keeps doing this i am not going to give this app a 5 until you fix this issue,1
"WHAT A HORRIBLE APP I JUST WOKE UP TO ""you've been logged out of this account the user may have changed the password"" BUT WHEN I LOGGED IN FROM MY OTHER PHONE . NOTHING WAS CHANGED. AND ALSO WHEN I TRIED TO LOGIN IT KEPT SAYING ""unknown error occurred"" HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE EVER. PLEASE RETURN ME BACK MY ACCOUNT.",1
First it doesn't let me put videos on my story cause they take it down saying that it's copyright when the video is clearly mine second each time I get notification when I got to the app I don't have any anyways this app is really bad I don't recommend it,1
"Account Recovery Support is Non existent. They have no support team, no way to open tickets and their selfie verification system is trash. They should use federal id like Linked In. Way easier to recover an account. If you go to r/instagram you can see hundreds of posts suffering the same. Trash!!!!",1
"A lot of glitches with the new update. Unable to see the likes on any of the posts. The ""Latest"" option in the ""Following"" section isn't working properly. Really disappointed with new update.",1
"Latest updates (past 5 months) are absolutely terrible. From not being able to see replies on comments, to follow and unfollow buttons glitching. It's just a mess all round.. Meta is really ruining the app for android. On Apple its still fine.",1
For some reason my translation is no longer working. I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling no luck. Translation working again but needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled to work properly on my cell phone,1
Not working properly since yesterday. Posts and message are unable to load and can't even see the stories. I cleared caches even re-installed the app but facing the same issue.,1
"My account got suspend, and my other account can't be verified because my number expired and there is no other option to use another phone number, and the last thing is I can't create a new account, when I want to create it is always rejected and an error comes from the Instagram system",1
"Waste of time, just nudity and spam everytime.no useful content like before. Easy hacked. Hard to log in and reopen app. Linking fb and insta makes it more worst. Bugs app.",1
3rd of June I wrote about the issues of notifications not being recieved & still hasn't been fixed. Knw it's not my ph because all other aps work fine. Please fix it. Also since last update commenting on vids has changed & your view of what your writing is blocked unless you back out which is annoying please address. Thanks Adding newest update had made sending/forwarding of others comments via dms not work smh,1
This app lags too much there are so many bugs in this app Instagram feels like is useless now its getting worse and worse with every update sometimes i can't post my stories it keeps loading but the stories won't post even though my wifi is working fine then i can't post things on this is just worse you should shut down your app now i think,1
"The feed doesnt work any more. Pretty impossible to use. Just jumps all over the place, hides posts and then goes completely blank. Why bother?",1
"Widely used application but there's major issue while attaching music to story, the photo is getting heavily blurred. So giving 1 star because 0 is not available.",1
Instagram not working properly I'm unable to open my all accs together.. This is frustrating!!! Also the theme mode is also not working well Helllllll this app is troubling me a lot I'm unable to open my acc now they are saying sorry there was a problem with your request I need an answer plz Hello Plzz see to it Update and make something new to,1
Be careful on ad's. Many are just scam websites. Instagram is 3d garde application. They do many frauds to gain money via ad. Once such incident is that. Instagram displayed some Ad. I made a purchase and now that site is no longer available at all. I lost money because of Instagram fake Ad.,1
"Instagram is run by pure evil. You are the product. They utilize your poor metal health and take advantage of it by making you addicted to constant dopamine hits. It provides escape, you want escape. But what you want is not what you need. Take a break from instagram, perhaps a permanent break.",1
"Why does my account always gets blocked saying that i am using using a service for more like or something with i account is private and have only 80 followers and all my likes are from them don't your AI have knowledge regarding this , this is so frustrating this is the second time this is happening to him help me fix this",1
Instagramsnlayest updates have made it so incredibly stupid. Instead of showing you the posts of the people you follow it only shows you random posts. It's new format is beyond annoying.,1
This is one of the worst social media site on planet earth like facebook and twitter in trying to be a page were you can meet new people and scammers interfer and force you at the very end to delete instgram account for good. I have not had any issues on tiktok and youtube because they are supper fun and meeting new people couldnt be any more greater than any others. They never disapointed me.,1
"instagram has lots of glitches sometimes like example it takes a rly long time for me to download a picture i took on it, or sometimes it doesn't even download. it aslo refreshes the explore rly suddenly i can't catch w what i was looking at all",1
I can't get notification From Instagram. I hv gone through the notification settings all options are on still I can't get notifications.. what's wrong with this app find out fast,1
"As of recently, all of my stories I've posted became low quality, making them blurry. I've looked up reasons what could be causing this issue and I've summed it up to be the app itself.",1
My account went hacked last week but I didn't have the two step verification. I've been trying to access and can't. Can anybody (person) help me or the only way are the standard questions in the help center?!,1
This new updated version sucks. I'm not able to send reels to anyone let alone save it. Neither my pin option nor changing chats background is working.,1
Worst app ever had to re download it 10 times in 2 day just to check my in box because it crashes everytime I sign in . Its 2022 and Instagram still is terrible hi5 works faster and that's from the stone ages.,1
When I am going to share some reels with my friends.... they are not getting those ..and vice versa. All the replies are also remained unsend ... I didn't face this kind of problems before the last time update....,1
"The user interface much like Facebook's is awful. ""Oh were you looking at something? We're going to refresh the page immediately and make sure you lose whatever it was you were looking at.""",1
"So many glitches in this update,not working properly, getting so much trouble to use, always their are network problem in Instagram but network is working properly in other app their is always buffering in this app.",1
Worst Instagram suspended my account unnecessarily and asking for email and confirmation code.I have typed my email correct but it's not giving confirmation code. I have waited til half an hour in full network. It still not giving. Wasting time because of this worst app. Please please fix this problem.,1
Worst app i have ever seen.... It has so many glitchs like after almost 8 to 9 reports u r not fixing my problem even after updates (notes) option not coming... Nd While uploading reel boom its not uploadingüôÇ i waited almost 5 hours to upload that reel so i can switch my 2nd accounts but huh... Make this app better nd fast...very time taking useless app...,1
"My account deactivation was done without giving any reason. Multiple attempts to appeal have fallen to deaf ears. If there is any violation, Instagram should let the users know so that the related changes can be made. Years of hard work and thousands of followers are lost in a moment. This is very very wrong behaviour. With such an arrogant attitude, Instagram is bound to fail in the near future.",1
Its the worst app ever. The notes feature isn't showing on my main account but it is showing on my private account which is even on the same device. I have updated the app 4 times already but nothing was fixed.,1
"I'm thinking on quitting this app for good, it has become impossible to upload photos without formating issues. Terrible. App keeps crashing when trying to upload posts",1
"What a terrible app. Right after registering Facebook starts harassing you for personal data. Right after the registration account is suspended for something and they force you to provide a lot of personal information in order to access the social network. No wonder Facebook/Meta are so ""loveable"" üôÇ",1
"Worst experience in this app. I've seen a lot of glitches, bug issues and problems uploading photos, stories etc. And I had reported these problems in Instagram help option but Instagram team is not taking any action in these situations.",1
"Unable to to upload reels, keeps saying failed due to bad internet connection which it isn't and tried uploading from both data and wifi... Fix it !!!!",1
I dont have any filters it's keeps on telling me your Device doesn't support this effect and if I do update my software or app it take forever to load the filters is really just annoying üòî,1
"Content, ads, promoted, suggested, ads, content, ads, suggested, promoted, content... Instagram in 2023 is no longer about following what you want, but rather what an algorithm decides you should see. A total failure.",1
"Certain accounts created about two years ago can't reply to specific dm messages, including mine. Nor can I use or see Message themes. Please fix this issue. It's been so from the moment the account was created.",1
Unable to check the followers list even after re-installing the updated version of the app. Also even if you login your friend's account just one time from your phoe it automatically links it to your account,1
Getting worst day by day ! Whenever i try to put story with filters it always shows loading even tho my internet is very good but still it's always the same damn thing. Fix it .,1
Very poor services when you cannot reply on support mail why to send mails on mail remove help option from instagram If you cannot revert timely on reported issue Remove Help option... very poor services... i am having mental trauma just because of your poor Services. Kindly revert on my reported issue as soon as possible,1
"Hey Instgram, Never knew u didn't have a customer support e-mail. That's soo shady of your service . My account was hacked 2 days ago and I'm still not able to retrieve. I've tried all the available ways to login to my account but of no use. The selfie video is not uploading from 2 days. It's just seriously annoying. I just want my account back, so do something about it.. atleast provide a customer support email",1
"The search song section is a mess. I write ""Billie Eilish"" and they show other people's songs at the beginning of the list. Also, I can't stop being mentioned by spam profiles (gift charts)",1
"The update broke it. 1) force closes, 2) when it finally ""works"" it has the option to switch which app (gallery or google) to use but if you choose gallery...the phones literal internal storage...you can't post multiple photos. Great work breaking the app for the millionth time.",1
In my search box I'm getting some unwanted images like popular in your country. I already not interested on that posts also it will not going. I already reported in Instagram with photos can you please remove the bug. Thanking You.,1
"Still no access to messenger while many people around me does, and now my keyboard covers what I'm typing. Are you kidding me? Not to mention the dark mode bug that reverts your theme to light mode but the text stays white after clicking a link in app",1
"I almost never rate apps, but this time i had to. The reels suggestions are unbearable, they bother me a lot, cause i don't care about any of them. And there is no way to turn them off. GET RID OF THEM!!",1
My account is not getting the latest update which includes replying to a particular message by swiping it and also I can't react to messages other than liking them. Very disappointed by this coz I reported this problem many times since I started my account and is no response from the team.,1
"I used to love this app, I've been using it for years now. It's has gotten too buggy, the algorithm is horrible! There's just endless things wrong with it but yh, its just not THAT worth it anymore.",1
Too many glitches & bugs. Most of the times I'm not able to refresh the feed. Stories reels nothing is working. Fed up with this now!,1
Can't go lower been having issues with this app and now just done. Can't message anymore with it crashing and saying it a developer issue. And some Privacy thing for restrictions pops up when i try to message.,1
"full of fraud and scammer ads all the way, never filter the quality of ads before approve, now Instagram is for scammer business! 99% ads in there is scam and fraud! and there seems do nothing and don't care about it, and now it keeps show up high draining battery at the background!",1
I'm not even giving a star at this point because because I've reported someone pretending to be me with no resolve at this point and I'm very disappointed!!! Other than that I've lived using this app on so many levels. When the issue gets resolved I'll gladly give 5 stars!!,1
"It ws a great app but now it's only a platform for endless ads. Every second video is an ad, it's driving me crazy.",1
"I didn't even want to give one star Can't even unfollow or follow people, it's happening ever single day. GET IT SORTED!! Stopped from commenting because I tag friends, no notification to say I was blocked, just blocked without any warning. Scammers all over Instagram, yet decent people can't even comment. Useless load of üí©",1
"Bug bug bug. The most buggy application I have ever used. Edit: It's almost 2023 and this freaking app is still buggy. Worse I have ever encountered. Yet most my friends use it, so I have to use it. Edit 2: Okay here is another bug bug bug comment. I swear this is the only application that works this terrible. After the last update it keeps crashing right after running the app. Frustrating as hecc.",1
Not able to post reelsüò§it's been 2 weeks since I reported a complaint from my account @mehndibybas but still this issue isn't solved.....Mentioning the account here so that you can check nd solve the issue soon..... waiting for it to be solved....,1
I can't access my full library to post pictures. Also before this I have been having issues for months when trying to edit if I am posting multiple pictures. I edit a picture then suddenly it duplicates the picture. I haven't been able to really post in forever then today not at all because I can't access my full gallery!,1
Why doesn't homepage reels/post style reels automatically load other reels when they're viewed in full screen mode? (In reel view without the normal post style). Instead now it just swipes the video/reel/post up back into the normal post view instead of showing other randomly loaded reels. üòïüòïüòïüòïüòï,1
"My reels just disappeared from my profile, but if I log in from Chrome they're there. And my face effects disappeared as well. It asks to turn on face effects from privacy settings. There's no such option in privacy settings! My filters and reels just don't work! It's just terrible, Instagram used to be much better than now",1
From few days my application has a issue it does load the page and dont even shows message after updating it i got this issue before it was working smoothly please goes through this,1
Please fix the reply option glitch some people are unable to reply to others message and we are also not getting the options when we long press on any messages.,1
"black screens and the app automatically closing itself right after opening makes me wanna give this app 0 stars. reels making has never been easy with this. my phone always get hot when using this especially the camera filters. like now, I can't even use Instagram. all I see is a black screen no matter how many times I had reinstalled this.",1
"since the february's update, I can't use the app. every time I open it, a ""the app stopped"" message shows up. I've sent a hundred feedbacks asking for support, and had no response. I always enjoyed the tools that apps offers, and I really miss them now, as I am using the lite version. I also have lose few followers and engagement, and that is harming me.",1
From almost 24 hrs not able to load reels Gets stuck even though I'm using a 5G enabled network device Thanks for not complaining on service provider Hope to resolve this on priority,1
"When I. Upload a reel. In story half of it's audio get muted. I don't know why and it doesn't allows me to upload. Reel of more than normal duration the second part of reel always gets failed to be uploaded now I'm irritated with app might delete it if these issues are not fixed, it's so annoying also now that 60min story feature is introduced I'm still not able to upload. Stories of that duration it really annoying.",1
"So we can hide the like count on photos to cover up how this app is no longer working for them, but you can't hide the like count on reels? Whoever worked on this ain't sleek. Having insta suppressing photos forced everyone (esp small creators) to turn to reels, and even those are flopping. The adds keep geting louder and more frequent. What's the point of this app?",1
I don't know what's wrong with my version as I'm not been able to see notes and it sucks... please help me with this issue ASAP...,1
"The app has stopped working. The main screen is just blank. I have tried everything. Restart my phone, delete cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Wifi and data makes no difference. DMs seem to be working. Funnily enough I have another account and that one works but my main one doesn't. Hope this is fixed soon",1
"Instagram is trying to compete with tiktok but is instead wrecking their platform. Reels are very annoying and your customers are not ready for the change you are creating. Everything is turning into 10 second videos and Instagram was originally where u could post your art, creations and your mind.. it's now gone after a 10 second video. Please go back to pictures instead of videos because I am getting bored fast",1
This update is not so good I found so many problems I didn't find music option so many glitches and bugs. Instagram audio is not available for some accounts why ? I am not insta user tell me ?,1
"Desperately needs optimization for the various aspect ratios we have on cell phones these days. I am writing this review on my ZFold3+1, and Instagram looks terrible in it. It needs photo scaling like in apps such as Reddit, so that I can select a photo or video and it will scale to fit my aspect ratio. Ironically content gets cut off whether I am on the front ""candy bar"" aspect ratio or the unfolded 4:3 ratio. The issue is most noticeable in the video content feed and stories.",1
"The app is getting worse....Too many bugs Sometimes it's not working.... I can't restory if someone mentioned , sometimes music is not coming sometime it blank or black What's happening I can't known",1
It shows random people that you never followed sometimes because you know a friend of a friend or because you liked one of the tags in the picture. This is weird and creepy. There's no option to only see the pages you chose to follow. Only to remove the ones you don't want but then it'll pop up another to replace that one.,1
"It has recently been plagued by bots, especially sex bots, and no matter how many times I've blocked or reported them, they keep coming back.",1
I am really getting frustrated.. I have been trying to upload a 15 sec reel on my page but it is not getting uploaded. It has been over an hour now. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app twice but no use. I am not able to do anything as it says the change is not possible as an upload is in progress.. This is really frustrating..,1
There are sound problems everytime I open the reels section I need to refresh it each time. sometimes sound is missing when posting reels on story. Very useless and hard to find filters. Annoying notes feature update. Shame on Instagram,1
"This app has many bugs ..... My post was been shown in drafts even after i posted it ... And when i removed it from draft, the original post was deleted... All the comments and likes were gone .... It was performing very well .... So one star .... If possible i would give 0 rating for this ...",1
Doesn't work well with uploads. Photo quality is still so low like it's 2001. The default folder ends up being some random folder. Uploading is a nightmare. Stop trying to be tiktok and go back to the basics. Don't lose your existing users.,1
"My app always shows it needs to be updated, even if i update it today tomorrow if i check it shows it needs to be updated. And my Instagram isn't the version my friends have, like i can't react to a text in DM and can't reply to a certain text in DM. I have tried everything, nothing works. I hope Instagram team help me solve this issue. Thanks",1
There is a bug in my account. I can't save the photos and vedios with the effects. For 2 days i am not able to watch reels and i have re installed for so many times and it is showing in the same way. Please do the needful. Please resolve the issues in my account. I have saved an affect and it is not showing it.,1
I was kicked out of my account. When trying to log back in it tells me wrong password. Then when I try to request password reset it tells me user not found. So I try to get help through the Instagram and it says invalid parameters.,1
Glitch with reels for days now and everything suggested to fix it doesn't work. Now I don't even have Reels as an option to add. Just stories and posts. Awful and frustrating. You can definitely do better than this Instagram.,1
"I've been using this app for years already but recently the app won't open and it's ALWAYS WHITE SCREEN. It's been days already. I already tried reinstalling it and restart my phone several times, still it won't open. In other phones, it opens but mine won't. This is frustrating! Please fix this issue as soon as possible.",1
"I was looking to stories of the people who I followed but it goes really even though I didn't touch the screen or even tap it. So I uninstalled it for a second and reinstalled it. Now I cannot login to my account and seems like your system shut my account down. Your supposedly ""login help"" doesn't load and just keeps saying error. FIX THIS Meta!",1
"Very bad experience. Since yesterday on logging in app as well as desktop site, my profile was showing black blank screen. Had raised the error with the developer team but no action has been taken . Deleted the app as well as profile now. Pathetic.",1
"This app keep getting worse and worse. Before the newest update it obviously only cared about ads. Now it's resorted to taking advantage of muscle memory, placing the ""new activity"" button somewhere less efficient to replace it with a shopping button. Update: reels :( no thank you.",1
"I have a bad experience of latest version of Instagram, always not supported is come.. And always close. And I don't want this reel to see but it are coming and coming... This is I'm not selecting reels bt it will occures automatically... This unwanted part which included in current version of Instagram... It's a comapatibility defect which is not supported for any system always occures not supported...",1
"After the new update, the app keeps on crashing every minute in my android phone. Clearing cache, reinstallation, permissions, nothing resolving the issue. For sure by the next year, it will not work on many sets until you get rich üí∞ and buy high end costly phones.",1
"the video editing should be way easier to manage, I am proficient in editing and Instagram is by far the most frustrating. I don't have my facebook connected because the photo/video formating is always different when cross platform posting! Why have the feature at all if it messes with your presentation? last of all I've deleted so many hrs of work because the reels mess up upon posting, especially when using commentary. Very frustrating all around, nowonder others use diff editing software x(",1
I have reinstalled the app after a period of time ...and some of the features like replying on messages are not working..its very frustrating and i would like to know why is it happening to some specific ids Edited - its been months and not a single contact has been made regarding my issues ... seriously disappointed by Instagram customer service.,1
Okay so far but the try again later message error message pops up way too much when you all made it to where we have limit on posts and when I tap on okay it pops up continually and has me constantly forcing the app to close and reopening the app. I had issues with supposed error messages account restriction due to third party sites to get more likes when I never do anything to get more likes through party sites which is false and I could possibly have meta sued for false account restriction.,1
Not sure if its the new update but the app does not load at all. It's unusable. I have a Samsung s22 ultra. Ive tried various troubleshooting methods and none seem to work. It must be the newest update that caused this problems because i havent had any problem for months/years. First time ever..,1
I keep being logged out. I can't open 2 different sessions because it logs out on the first one. The stories are flickering randomly and won't let me watch them because they slide by themselves and won't let me slide back. I've confirmed all my account security info and did a password reset and its still the same,1
"Stories of people I follow are automatically swiped super fast to Sponsored stories. It's getting increasingly annoying to use Instagram. Not interested button doesnt really work, Can't click on Polls. I look at a product on Amazon or Flipkart for 5 seconds and I get hundreds of ads about them even after disabling it in settings.",1
"I am facing lots of problems in Instagram. First of all I can't upload the videos secondly i can't get the notification quickly though I give permission of notification. Thirdly in voice call once I start the call on speaker than it couldn't change to normal call...,.. So I m very disappointed with this Instagram",1
"Horrible glitches and technology issues recently, constant problems with the ""action blocked"" feature, I reached out several times to the Instagram help center, no response. It's two weeks later and I'm going to have to report this issue again.",1
Instagram music isn't working and they have like maybe 20 songs I can pick from right now. They all suck as well. Plus they don't allow the lyric break downs anymore. Not sure if it's a glitch in the system or what.,1
"Here's some advice: Don't let your account get hacked because Instagram WILL NOT help you. They won't even respond. And want to organize your feed in any way? Like with newest posts on top? Nope. My pictures and videos often look different once they've been posted, but not just as a result of compression; sometimes they will be glitched out and you'll have to redo the post. This app can eat my poo.",1
"Daily am using Instagram but i have never thought to give 1star , unfortunately am giving because from last update am not able to see my old photos in the conversation which I checked weekly. I don't know what happened toh Instagram. Please make some changes in the conversation saving all photos from beginning. Thank you!",1
"App is trash. Every time you open the app it makes you change your password. Has to be long, have special characters numbers capital letters no more than 2 consecutive letters. Oh and it cant be the same password youve ever had before. Not to mention they harvest your data and personal information and sell of to third parties",1
"Used to have content tailored to your interests, allowing you to discover interesting new accounts and people. Now the algorithm recommends reels with no views, random accounts and topics that have nothing to do with your preferences. Hiding these posts does nothing, not to mention the frequent bugs and glitches each update.",1
"Instagram has been on a major decline for the past couple of years now and continues to get worse. Spam, excessive advertising, content suppression, glitches and bugs... The list goes on. Report problems - I have been doing so for years - You may as well be shouting into the void as they never get resolved. I am a content creator, who like many has spent years building a significant following. It is beyond frustrating to see that the majority of my followers no longer see my new posts.",1
"The copy link option to copy Instagram stories has completely disappeared!! I used this alot & now with this awful new update it's impossible to do!! All I get is the option to 'Report' or 'Mute' when I click on the 3 dot's!! I know other people are having this same problem aswell!! Please bring back the copy link option, this new update is awful!!",1
"Terrible! I'm dropping now after years. You can't save your work without one or maybe two video ads being put in your way, which take up more time than it took to edit your photo. Find something else.",1
Every since I did this last update nothing is working. My feed is lagging. Everything is taking forever to load. I took the app off my phone and uploaded again like 5 times already and still the same thing. I've sent 2 bug reports already and still not fixed. This has never happened before.,1
"I really love scrolling through the app and all but you guys gotta fix a lot of issues. I don't know why but there are some features like notes , 45 sec story time and some other ones , i didn't get them at all . All my friends got these features in their account. Though my app is up to date . I even tried logging in my acc in my friends Instagram (who got these features) but no it's just not available for my account only . How the hell is it possible. I am really disappointed , like why only me",1
"1, the notes disappeared. 2, most of the updates come late because of having an android which is very unfair. 3, the app is so Laggy and sometimes it doesn't let me post videos, or I'll try to post and it'll exist me out of the app completely. 4, viewing posts just resets the entire app. you need to do better and fix this app.",1
"I enabled two factor-authentication for safety purposes. I uninstalled insta for a few days and when I reinstalled it , it asked for a login code which was fine only if I RECEIVE the login code. I still didn't get the code on the registered number and no notification whatsoever. The customer service is a joke because no issue ever gets resolved and after submitting a report they just block your account and make no effort to recover it .",1
"At first it was fine not that good since it changes the quality of the photo you post and size but was able to manage that until the app updated itself and I couldnt get the ""reply to a specific message feature"" which is really annoying and frustrating please insta fix this",1
"When uploading a video there is an important button called cancel upload. Why in instagram wasnt there? I was uploading a large video and i cant stop the upload. My phone keeps lagging because of the upload. Also when i chose the desired music, but when it was recorded and uploaded, it was playing a different one.",1
"You guys are doing Instagram garbage. Be wake up before it falldown as Facebook 1. If you have really that much interest in reel, make a separate insta reel app 2. Dont put suggestion post inbetween scrolling home screen of following people's post until ""you'll catch up everything"" 3. and I'm again repeating 2nd point is very very important. It is concern not blame take it as advise...",1
"1) Worst app as it always clashes and screen turns to black when I'm trying to log in to an existing account. 2) sometimes in reel continue watching option is not there and when I tap that tell it only muted and unmuted. 3) when I am trying to put a story, in middle it clashes and screen turns black. Doing same process several times dosent solve my issue.",1
"Daily user, don't like update! Creating a combination video and photo post is impossible now. It's just automatically turned into a reel which I hate. Even just a photo post, the auto adjust makes it so hard to get my pictures posted how I want it to be. It's annoying making any kind of post now bc it forces it into a new position or into a reel. Hate this new update. It's so frustrating!!!",1
Worst algorithm. Instagram needs to go back to chronological feed and show more content from the people you FOLLOW. Stop forcing reels and ads down our throats. For an app with such a large user base it's absurdly glitchy. Make the algorithm better for users and less about ADVERTISERS. Corporate greed is an understatement. I feel like if someone else made a functional photo sharing app with a better algorithm it would BLOW insta out of the water.,1
"I have never seen a worst app in the world after Facebook.It takes lots of user's data,which is annoying to me.Hackers are full here.Unable to sign in the app.",1
"Instagram android app is finally completely broken. After numerous reinstalls and all the usual non effective ""fixes"", there are no new posts, I can no longer submit bug reports, and for a week have not been able to access nor add to saved collections. Plus it suddenly became too big for my phone screen. This garbage app needs serious overhauling NOW.",1
"Nothing but a blank screen... It started with feed not refreshing. (Also HATE the reels btw. If I wanted to be on tiktok I'd be on tiktok. I have instagram to see others' photos and collate my own in a lovely square looking feed). Anyway. Thought it was about time I did a cull of pages I follow. Then you banned me from doing anything because I unfollowed too many pages in a short time. Logged out, cleared cache, uninstall. Reinstalled and now app opens to a black screen. Unusable!Please fix!",1
"1. Let me archive reels. I don't need them in a separate tab. I want to add it back to my profile grid, and now I can't. 2. When I try to watch someone's reels from their account page, I tap a video but then it plays a different video instead. 3. Does ANYONE use the Marketplace button. Seriously.",1
"So I had this app since 2019 , so I have seen what Instagram used be like simple to use, easy to post videos and photos like why can't Instagram go back to their roots just keep it simple but I didn't know I was having issues with the app until recently . Here's my problem with the app I would click on it and all I see is a black screen I can't press any buttons and I try to uninstall and then redownload it but nothing is working I tried everything I need this issue to be fixed soon real soon.",1
"Unable to use many of its features like reaction on particular message(i can only give heart reaction to any msg). Selection of particular msg to reply doesn't work in my app. No emojies are available there, even stickers provided by app are very few and totally useless. I'm unable to use many of its filters. Songs list provided for stories or post is very short. I am unable to change the theme I reported it so many times but their is no response from your team . üò°",1
"I cant even open the app anymore. I would click the app and have it open but then instantly crash and say ""Instagram keeps stopping"" I can't even enter for a split second. It's been like this for a week now and I've deleted and reinstalled, I've restarted my phone plenty of times, I've cleaned cache thinking that could be a factor but none of it worked. What's going on Instagram, I'm seeing hella people having issues but your not addressing them and saying your working on it.",1
"9/28 - Issues with Android: 1) When switching between accounts, the theme gets messed up and you can't see any text and you have to close the app and reopen to clean up the theme. 2) In DMs, I can't select when I @ a user, I have to manually type out the whole user name. 3) Reels audio is missing sometimes between viewing different Reels, need to scroll up and down to refresh the Reels.",1
"Just as any other social media app, it is highly destructive for people's (especially women's) self-esteem because of the algorithm that pushes forward unreachable beauty standards and Mark will, of course, do nothing about it. I will still use it to look at cat pics tho",1
"Hey support, I am creating a reels from suggestion and when try to add some photos in that video,app is crashing everytime.. please take a look into the issue..",1
"The app is good but in messenger some accounts could not able to chat with the help of swip left to reply option and also reacted on a message with the help of Emojis, please fix this early Iam so many times report it but not fixed at. Thank you",1
Now a days Instagram is going more bad not give reply options nor emoji option while posting reels or picture it is not uploaded it will say can't post this picture I just want to request Instagram to check the Instagram make sure that all the problems are solved,1
"So many more problems have happened with new updates. My messages will glitch out and not pop up or allow me to send anything, my Instagram forever loads, I have a bunch of bot accounts that are inappropriate liking my stuff too.",1
"All time worst app i have ever seen, all data save in instagram cloud storage not in phone, so account change one phone to another all the old msg and photos are show in other phone also.",1
I am giving 1 stars because my videos do not get views on insta reels....I make videos with so much effort and I don't get views at all. I m very disappointed üòû otherwise overall it is good app.,1
Getting way too many suggestions and ads. I don't like the new suggestions post. It's annoying and in the way. I would rather delete the app instead of having it if the developers continues this stupid suggestions post. Unable to see any new posts that friends are putting up. It's been quite sometime that Ive logged on and it seems like that app has not fix the problems.,1
"Using Instagram from 3 years!! But from last 2-3 months I'm facing so many bugs, messages are received 2-3 days later and some messages are not even delivered! üôÅ",1
Since Yesterday I changed the password more than 4 times still its showing that your account is hacked. I understand that I stop many peoples but it doesn't mean that my account is hacked. Kindly fix this bug. Till this it will be un-installed only.,1
"Adding reel feature in this app is very bad idea, wast of time, 80% reels are useless. IT May be very harmfull for our youth mentality.",1
I can't swipe a msg during chat even my friends have this feature. why..? i need this many times send feedback but no response yet redownload Instagram many times update but still i haven't this feature to swipe a msgüôÑü§¨üòï,1
The interface is literally better on a browser than in the actual app... how sad is that? I don't know what in the world is wrong with this thing but do not install it. It is beyond repair at this point.,1
"My Instagram is falsely reported time and again and I have been trying to report this matter directly but I'm not getting any link to do so, so this is a warning to this app to kindly send me a direct link where I can directly discuss this issue or I'm going to the police and the consumer rights. You have 24 hours ....",1

Issues in processing not working properly i can't see anyone States or account page is not opening and network is good then also it's not working..,1

You cannot switch accounts it always show please wait until it's posted and ik I haven't posted anything and when i try to send something to my story it's unable to go ... Seriously if someone out there have a better app it's a perfect time to launch it!!!,1
"App crashes all the time, especially when trying to make reels. Reels glitch all the time, including audio issues, text overlapping or blurry, I lose access to my insights regularly, I see more ""suggested"" posts than ones from people I follow. I wouldn't use it if I didn't have to as a content creator",1
"Screen is blank/white upon logging in for months. Cleared the cache, uninstalled/reinstalled the app multiple times, updated it, reported the problem to IG, and still not working. The web version works, very poorly, and the reels are gone. Bug seems to very common, lots of people reporting blank screens.",1
"I am struggling with messages like i can't react and reply to messages , i changed many accounts just for this problem and it's still there.",1
"Keep getting spammed with notifications that aren't turned on ""so and so shared a post"". Zuckerberg is trying to drive people to open this dying app by having notifications that can't be disabled.",1
"I have been using Insta for years without issue. Recently, I keep getting messages that my videos are using licensed songs and are being removed (videos from 2 and 3 years ago) all my videos are made on my Android using music and melodies licensed in the video creator before uploading to Insta. More recently, it takes hours for my posts to load. When I open the app, I see posts from days before and the feed won't refresh. Not sure what's going on. Have uninstalled, rebooted, etc. Still no luck",1
Over a decade old and still trash. I mean seriously its 2022 and it still can't successfully save a draft or post pictures properly. Still buggy as hell. Thank God I only have to use this app for my boss and not my own personal use. Whoever is working on this app needs to be fired on god. What a joke. Do. Better.,1
"The last time I reviewed here, but the application is nowhere near better, it gets worse. I can't upload videos for many excuses told by Instagram. I can't even post carousel to maximum amount (most of it only able to post 8-9, but it can't reach 10). Also, the algorithm is annoying! Why would I see anyone's posts on my timeline out of people I followed? You are beyond disappointing and irrelevant!",1
"Dark theme 3+ years later still unstable needs more theme options like in dm chats maybe then it would be easier to view, stories not loading correctly and not appearing in archive, lacking functions that either don't work or aren't avaliable like on ios.",1
Its so glitchy and doesn't work half the time. I'm busy trying to login and load my messages right now and call my bf but nothing is working. It works on my other Instagram account but not my main. I'm literally about to cry,1
For 4 months I was hardly able to use my Instagram. I have only recently been able to actually see feeds and story's again,1
There is a problem with my account for very long time and I updated instagram many times please it's my humble request to fix the problem that when I am making reels I am not able to see that reel twice if I don't like that reel I have to discard everything the song the filter everything. I am really embarrassed about it. And it happens very long time.,1
I getting so much strange things that always happened on instagram like instagram keep showing error message while I want to follow people and my followers count is stuck. Fix this problem please,1
"I'm facing issues like I can't add my archive story to my highlights & unable to make new highlights, I have reported thrice a time but still haven't fixed.",1
"Loved this app until it stopped working a few weeks ago. Now all i get isa black white screen. No notifications, nothing. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Still didn't work. Waited for an update. Tried that and it still doesn't work. I run my business marketing in this platform and haven't been able to post reels in weeks!",1
"there are so many glitches happening now when editing pictures to post on the feed. it will automatically edit the pictures extremely harsh, replace one of my pictures with a previous one, distort the image, or just completely discard all of my edits when clicking next. its getting so frustrating to even try anymore.",1
"Haven't been able to login on desktop app or Chrome for 4 days despite correct credentials - phone number, email, and username. Can't login on phone either even after Uninstalling and reinstalling. There are zero infractions on my account, I have two factor authentication, and my account is private. I get ""try in a few minutes"" and ""try later"" and no password reset emails. I'd rather die of dysentery on a trail in a Conestoga than further deal with this crapp.",1
What's happened again with this app impossible to post pics from your gallery as they don't show your complete pic. It's unusable!!! Review based on latest update. It's poor. Layout is all wrong with the activity and plus button shoved to the top of the screen replaced by video feed and shopping at the bottom. Seems really buggy and fragmented as well. Needs sorting asap,1
"Never done anything out of the ordinary until a few weeks ago when it would jump back to a blank screen and couldn't access any other apps for a solid minute or two. Kinda disappointed as i get most information on here like college updates, charity events and job pop ups. Going uninstall until it sorts it out.",1
"The ""updates"" are terrible and annoying. Instagram is constantly shoving ads into my feed, some of which have NOTHING to do with my interests. In the app itself, when it is working, it caters to popular accounts and promotional accounts that pay to have their work spread via those same annoying ads. There are so many problems with this app and I can't even begin with the amount of limited space offered for a review. Basically: This app was good until Facebook took over.",1
"Doesn't work. Suspended me for ""not following community guidelines"", despite never having made a single post. The appeal interface then ran into some sort of bug, so that's that, I suppose. Very unclear interface too, all ""mystery meat navigation"" and the dark theme frequently stops rendering text. Content seems limited to soccer players and girls with fake eyelashes. Avoid.",1
"I have a white screen when opening my instagram app and it wont even let me log in for a while now , for several days , more than a week i've had to use the lite version and its not the same at all... many other people have the same issue, we have update the new and the app still won't work , its a white screen upon clicking the app and it stays that way... pleasr fix this issues. Thanks",1
"In the last week (today is 28th Aug) whenever I scroll through posts I get to see maybe 4 or 5 posts then 'cannot refresh feed' comes up. I have cleared my cache, logged out. Logged back in. Uninstall app and reinstalled (android) STILL CANNOT REFRESH FEED message comes up, or the app stalls in the middle of a story, most frustrating. I am NOT having any issues with other apps or Internet connection, just this damn app. Please, whatever 'upgrades' you have done - sort out the bugs.",1
This app definitely needs to be worked on because immediately you download the app the music icon on the stories does not work...It says that some music is not available in my country...,1
"So I had to do a factory reset of my phone to fix an issue, once resolved I tried to log back in to Instagram via the app and keep on being told to do a video self verification, and repeatly told they can't verify I'm a real person. You look at the help, which is useless btw and basically if you don't pass and or not able to log on via an authentication app (which I cant do as lost the set up through the factory reset) then tough, you can't log in to your own account!!!",1
"White screen keeps popping up at the log in for 2 weeks- I can only use Instagram through Google Chrome and it's really annoying. Tried clearing the cache, downloading an older version of the app, clearing storage on my phone, etc. Even sent a problem report and no one has gotten back to me. It's frustrating but also might be my sign to quit the app.",1
"[2019] it crushes everytime I try to watch a video, everytime I want to make a rewind video, everytime I want to do something. this is the worst app I've ever tried. Edit [2022]: I got a new phone and now the situation is better. It still has some bugs that should be solved on Android because I cannot accept that iPhone users get to have better quality than android users.",1
"It blacks out and won't let me get messages or view stories or post. This is my way of living. I pay my rent using this platform. And now I'm stuck. For 2 days going on 3 and it's so frustrating. With all the updates they always do you think they'd fix this proble. I cried the 1st day. Cause I lost so many orders. Reached out to IG support no help. Rest, deleted & uploaded app again. Cleared everything. And not is working and no one is getting back to me. To help resolve this issue.",1
"My account got deactivated for no reason, I hadn't even finished setting up my account. I have not posted anything, I just installed the app today, and there was no reason to deactivate it. I sent a picture of myself to verify it. no response yet. also every 5-20 minutes a ""we're verifying your account"" message pops up on my screen, no matter what I'm doing on my phone or how many times I close the instagram window.",1
"The app isn't working, I'm getting feeds from 2-3 day and it never does update and when you refresh it gives you a post from a different day. Instagram/ meta sort this out and sick of the bots/ scammers",1

"I don't know what r u based on to give the messenger update that gives new reactions and msgs swiping to instagram dm. I thought it's about location so i was waiting for it to come to Morocco, but now my friend who's literally my neighbor has it for a very long time! I have a better device than him and i have the latest update from instagram so what's the problem? That's really unfair and annoying.",1
"Bugs, ads, and posts from people I don't follow. Constantly trying to push people and ideas onto me but censors all the main people I want to follow for trivial reasons. A data collector and propaganda mechanism.",1
"This app is honestly helping with what it says it will help, I've been trying to login in my account ,and trying to change my password but somehow I got logged out again seeing that someone else is also on this account with a different cell, I reported to Instagram that I've been hacked & been struggling to change my password. PLEASE DO HELP SOLVE THIS MATTER BECAUSE NOW MY ACCOUNT SAYS I'VE BEEN LOGED OUT",1
"Dear Instagram team, Recently in my Instagram account I am unable to send message to anyone whenever I am going to send message it's showing me that I cannot send message for 3 days but I have not done anything wrong and I am sure I have followed your rules of conduct and so i kindly request you to pls back my account as soon as possible My Instagram I'd :__smily__don__ Thanking you",1

This app really sucks they scroll for you. Itdisappears.The prostitution is Offending as heck. IT ALSO NAVIGATES TO THE PAGES IT WANTS. NO CONTROL... SUCKS BAD disappointing. First INSTAGRAM HAS HELPED ITSELF TO ALL. YES ALL. YES ALL. YES EVERY SINGLE PHOTO AND VIDEO ON MY CELL PHONE. I AM VERY IMPRESSED. NOT. IT IS A HUGE IMFRINGEMENT OF MY PRIVACY RIGHTS. I DID NOT GIVE them FULL FREE RANGE OF MY PERSONAL PICTURES. I SENT THEM ONE SINGLE PHOTO FOR A PROFILE THIS IS SO CRIMINAL. Filing charges,1
"Any time you try to post a photo the app undoes all the work and zooms in to weird spots randomly, ruining all your photos",1
It's become a garbage advertising platform. Most of my feed is ads and annoying suggestions. No longer useful !!!,1
You guys should not be able to access personal info because i allowed you guys access to my have my camera post pics on the app. Change this it's weird being followed enough on a mac book Also change the god damn way to post pictures you guys are forcing reels don't want it,1
"When I open this application after two minutes, it takes me out of Instagram. This always happens. Please solve this problem very quickly Thanks üòä",1
Worst after update my story archives not starting since last month and I want to highlight my old story please fix my archive and one more thing I can't follow when I follow anyone it says certain activities and I try a lot and I reported hundred times but instagram not fixing this,1

I can see some bugs in my instagram account. The chat theme is not working. Many more bugs. Please fix those bugs before adding new features. It's a humble request.,1
nothin but sexual content when you report it it just sends it to a bot and they take down that one post. you need a human being to go through these profiles. and ban all these accounts and prostitutes it is 100% against guidelines. you could totally do it. I can't go scroll through Instagram for 15 seconds without seeing porn or prostitutes FIX IT !!!!!!!,1

Stories playing sound automatically, all sponsored content, only see 1 post from people I know followed by all suggested posts, can't turn off suggested posts. Best thing about it is I barely waste time on it anymore",1
I don't need suggested post about some strangers. Too many advertisement and i had enough hiding them. I rather go premium with no ads and suggested post. Instagram just getting worse and annoying like facebook,1
"Too many ads, too many scammers posing as ""life coaches"" when I see 3 ads before one normal post od say that's a bit too much. If you block those scammers they magically come back a month later with a slightly different profile to scam you with. I have not been scammed",1

Hey @instagram @Meta it‚Äôs seems that Instagram messages aren‚Äôt working. Some kind of unread messages appearing again and the already messages are not appearing after sending them. Please help ASAP,1

How do you figure when I was deleting hundreds that had accumated over 4 yrs time as well as ones I followed??!! I cant even reset my password because my contact info has changed and I dont recall my old password from 4 yrs ago. All I wanted was.to streamline my page to family only,1

The notification panel and shopping page keep switching their places every time I open the app. This is ridiculous!,1
A picture of only HALF MY FACE got taken down for nudity. MY FACE. Best part? My picture has been up FOR A WHOLE YEAR (almost 2 years to be specific). This app is nothing but a waste of space and time at this point.,1
So many glitches In my Instagram account reply issue is occurring when it is fixed then I appreciated with this app . I can't reply any message in chat ... So fixed this issue in my Instagram account..,1

I don't have cross messenger update. I can't react with emojis and reply to specific messages. I have reported this many time. But i have received zero response. Terrible response from Instagram,1

"All I see on my fyp is nuse people and videos of people being killed (and showing the entire thing, bodies and all) yet instagram isn't taking any of it down! Wth is wrong with you instagram?! I used to love going on this app but now I'm considering uninstalling and spreading the word to get insta shut down",1
There is stuttering and lag after recent update. Choppy video and things not loading. Every other app runs fine.,1
Terrible unfriendly interface. Tons of bugs. Zero support. And it's getting only worse with each update üëéüëéüëé,1

Can't view text box. Covered by keyboard. Can't see what I'm sending to correct misspelled words. Annoying,1
Somehow I feel like Instagram has fewer code developers than Twitter after the Musk takeover - 1 star for the worst UI instability and glitches ever seen in an app. Maybe Google Play should even consider taking down this app because it is so unstable it probably violates some of its policies about service availability etc.,1

Instagram used to be cool until they started wanting to be like tiktok. I have a private account with few followers and now most posts I see are not from my friends but from suggested posts of people I don't follow. I'm considering deleting the app for good.,1
Very very old technology used really need to work on it.... Very slow uploading.... Only few options available for video editing.... Not happy üò°,1
If I could give Instagram 0 stars I would. I had a acc for almost 4 years and it got deleted or banned for no reason. And I mean no reason I barely ever went on there unless I was posting something new. Then today I went to try and make a new account note this is almost a year later. And I can't even do that. This app really sucks. And I know people are still going to use it but I wish someone would come up with something better because Insta seriously needs to go. 0 stars,1
"What is happening to my instagram, I don't know if I'm the only one experiencing this but I can't open my account like once I click the app, it'll go back to home page. It's been weeks since it happened, I don't want to make another account again. Try to solve this.",1

"Garbage. Why is it that on my main account my stories split up into 15 second videos still, but on the account I barely use you muppets have updated it to no longer split them. This should be an update for all accounts. Just a recent example of the douchebaggary from the IG team.",1

Too many videos of animal abuse which reports never remove. Entire platform is just the same rubbish posted over and over by people who didn't create the content. This app was better when it was literally just my friends content and no masses of random people doing messed up stuff. Garbage,1

On top of that, now Instagram also thinks I'm a bot and won't allow me to follow anybody else, despite the fact that I have reached out multiple times to prove that I'm actually a freaking human...doesn't matter. No response. Nothing ever fixed. It just gets worse with every update. Thanks ""meta"". You suck. Give zuckerberg another pile of money to burn. I hate you.",1
Editing your photos is an incredibly frustrating experience. None of the changes or edits are saved.,1
I will choose the least If there is a zero star or negative star option . Earlier it's super awesome but now so pathetic and terrible service for posting something on the app with highest network range and the long time affecting the other network activities. So much annoying,1
"So many Glitches. So Many Bugs. Doesn't Work Smoothly. I am Unable To Upload my Stories. I am Unable To seeing Others Stories , reels or Profile. My Net was Working Properly still It takes Too Much Time To Upload My Stories. Please Improve It",1
"I really don't like that you open the app, you see something interesting and then it disappears. I might leave Instagram forever the next time it happens.",1

"Bug , Instagram dont showing photo, etc. Its like loading forever . Like my internet is problem but not . I try change wifi & internet provider . Same problem . Try to uninstall, but in the day this problem just come again . This problem is recently.",1

There are many bugs ..my account 'clicks and shotss ' doesnot have the option for inviting collaborator...i reported it a hundred times..but instagram didnt fix it...this app have many bugs,1
I think that the app is fine but I'm currently experiencing a problem my version of this app doesn't have filters and when I googled how to get filters it said you have to update the app but when I get to Google play store it doesn't show the updating option that's why I'm giving it 1 star,1
"New update is terrible, there are too many glitches. I am unable to lipsync while making reels. There is no logout option too. Whats wrong? Kindly take care of this.",1
"It would be better to provide a settings like, hide a post from particular person like we hide from story without blocking them..But now its like if we want to hide a post we want to remove them from our friend list üôÅ.. Its very annoying",1
"If it would even let me open an account I may be open to offering more stars. As it stands, I can't get past the 'I agree' in terms and conditions. So until you fix that huge bug then you get 1 star.",1
It's good acc for those whom the Instagram team update their acc.Bt few acc r still in old version whc is even worse than other apps.The team r nt solving the prbms tht r reported 2 thm.I hd been reporting the prblms fr 10 tmes. Wr the is no change up to now. It's a worst experience 2 use the app whc as no new features yet now.Still my acc is in the old version after lots of reporting nd update .No option fr swipe reply vanish mode theme Collaboration etc. Even I'm waiting the team 2 slove thz.,1
"Didn't expect this from Instagram. 1. Stories take forever to upload. Have to uninstall and install again. 2. No reels or music option after installing again. 3. While making reels, the video isn't visible, only song plays making it impossible to sync music with the video. 4. Hangs up the entire mobile while uploading a reel.",1
They dont offer enough options for unlpcking your account if youve been hacked. They only allow you to use the original phone number you used to create the account. You can change the number in the settings but it doesnt matter cause if you get locked out you have to use your original number. Also its glitchy and the ammount of hackers is insane with instagram doing nothing to stop it or help recover peoples accounts. This app is not safe for your personal information.,1
"Terrible, just terrible. First time in many months, and when I try to post multiple images in my feed, I simple cannot do it. The app freezes, and then crashes. Awful experience, and I've been a frequent user since the beginning... never saw so many issues.",1
"Instagram needs to fix bugs on new updates like 3 days after updates. During July 2022, I tried to get on the app and it appeared a white screen the entire time. I have been watching YouTube videos on how to fix it, but those tips don't work. Don't trust the internet, it's doesn't help. Hopefully you guys fix this current problem and hopefully it fixes by August. If not, then I'm never using this app again.",1
The glitch and algorithm is tremendous and it makes it so annoying to use the app. Instagram should improve the reaches of all the accounts because people don't tend to get enough reach and interaction in their post as they deserve which demotivates a lot and I myself being a victim of that would totally blame instagram alone for that. The inbox creates a lots of issues. Sometimes the messages don't come the moment they are sent but later on appears suddenly and gets seen automatically.,1
"Can't connect to my Instagram account even if I try the reset password option via mail. It's always saying "" an unknown error as occurred"". This is so annoying, I haven't done anything wrong and and I can't log into my account. Now they say that my account will be desactivated. It's been a whole day and I still can't have access and they don't even do a thing to fix that. Anyways if I was able to give 0 start I would have done it",1
"Can't sign in. Even though same credentials are working fine on chrome mobile browser. Error says ""the username you entered doesn't appear to belong to an account. please check your username and try again"". Credentials are pasted from my password manager so it's not like I'm entering wrong username or password",1
Whole app is terrible. Photo loading no loner works. No new content shown. Used to love insta but now I can't be bothered with it. Seems like the developers feel the same way.,1
"bugs all the time. latest bug rn is not being able to see what im writing when i make a comment. i dont get notifs for accounts i have it turned on for, and now my messages start halfway down my screen bc instagram thinks its more important to show me randoms at the top of my screen they think i should message instead",1
"whenever i open the app it just shows the IG logo and then the screen turns black after a little while. i've reinstalled the app multiple times now, and i've deleted all memory it's had on my phone, but it still keeps on doing that. i restarted my phone and the app as well. i have enough memory on my device so the app should be working. i don't know what i'm doing wrong at this point, please fix this.",1
"Instagram used to be a user friendly app, but with the algorithm change its hard to get any likes at all. You have to post reels instead of pictures if you want your Instagram to grow. They're a rip off of every other social media app. Atleast before they had some uniqueness with just being able to post pictures, but now they're just a bad version of tik tok. If you don't already have this app I'd recommend you don't get it.",1
Everytime I have tried to use this app I only get a black screen. I have deleted it multiple times now and still nothing. I have restarted my phone for multiple times again but still nothing and this is just frustrating. Please get to the problem and rectify it. If we could attach photos be certain that I'd have done that.,1
My insta account is not getting updated even after i have updated it many times. I do not get the reply option nor can i get the temporarily deactivate option. Need help.i dont even have the chat theme option. I have 2 accounts second one i have recently made has all the updates but my old account which iz my main account does not have any update,1
Actually I have changed my phone recently and I opted the two factor authentication in my Instagram account and now I can't login into my account. I also written a number of mails to the instagram team and they didn't reply to anyone of the mails. Rectify it as soon as possible.,1
"App is not working properly messages not opening, not showing any stories, kindly fix the bug, I installed many times again ad again but the problem is same only buffering on any selected option",1
"Not working properly, no option for music in story and it's take to much time to open a videos",1
It's nice and easy to use However I'm not able to put or post story as last time and the page went blank and so many bugs Also it's been a month since i submitted a report about Instagram collab but they are not able to fix it.,1
So many glitches. So many bugs. Doesn't work smoothly and on inbox not showing emoji and reply options also I am reporting in app not responsible 50 times I report a problem but no response results. I am tooo borred of using this app ....,1
Pathetic app. Doesn't let me login with my username or email id. I can do that just fine on the browser. However they force you to install the app as the browser prevents you from viewing content.,1
"as an editor, the new update is absolute hell. very low exposure and the vids under the hashtags i follow dont show anymore. the worst is the reel. every thing i post becomes a reel üòê i want the old Instagram back",1
"Form past few days, my insta is not working properly. First I thought it's due internet but other app is working fine, am able to play video on YouTube at 720p without buffer but on insta it's buffering at the same time.",1
Instagram is One of the best in social media. But it is worst for chatting. You can not response to any particular msg like WhatsApp and Facebook. Many user have this option but I do not have. Even I reported it several times.,1
I see people choosing music for their instagram stories as per their choice but whenever I am trying to search a music for my picture stories it gives me an error of no result found. this is happening from a long time. I have been using this earlier but now its been 3 months i have uninstalled and did everything again nothing changed. And no way u can contact insta they are no where to be found to fix.,1
"Used to love Instagram until they banned my account without providing a reason as to why. Created a new account, added pics, got flagged for nudity on 2 right away when I'm fully clothed with no skin showing at all outside of my face. It's a flawed system!",1
"horrible horrible horrible app i install and reinstalled it several times i still cannot send photos in the message area the icon of photos doesn't show up yes i allowed the app to inter my datas but still not working, i cannot post reels niether whyyyyyy",1
"I can't log into my account. I didn't receive my code through my phone. My backup codes, don't work. When i get support, it decides to freeze and close. Trash state.",1
I'm using this app since 2020 .. But this is getting worst day by day.. Insta remove save option from story.. And during make reel if we choose an audio after discard reel we lose audio...we can't make a perfect transition video on insta cut its cutting audio after every transition..And when we go to watch our own reel this is not showing particular.... Worst app. Very disappointed with Instagram ..this was far better in 2020 than right now.,1
"I feel very bad experience with this aap because I am not able to share a pic in this app And whenever I am trying to share a pic , i am not able to see any pictures from my gallery also my all pic getting vanished ‚òπÔ∏è",1
App is too laggy. Shows inaccurate time mutual were active and double sends messages. And the worst part is how the sent photos don't load or show. Hate this app honestly.,1
"app became super buggy, i cant watch reels anymore because it just stops and lags half way through the reels even with full working wifi and i can get message notifications but i cant open or find the messages for some reason.",1
"Though I have strong internet connection it shows me it's cannot refresh feed and the chats,story and reels or post are not coming.. It's just buffering and loading... So I uninstalled and again download it now the short note facility is not available.. This app just frustrates me..",1
"From last few months I'm facing problems in mentions. When I mentioned someone in my story sometimes it send it to that person in messages but sometimes doesn't. Also if someone collabs with me in a post, option of collab doesn't came to me. Please Instagram team fix the problem............",1
"Fix the in app video editing, it's absolutely garbage. Constant crashes and glitches,an app focused around pictures and videos should at least be able to do that. Smh",1
Some bugs found in music while adding storys many songs are missing ??? I kindly request you recover all latest trending songs in music while adding story.!!,1
"Constant bugs, currently music feature for stories doesnt work and my messages wont send, uninstalled and reinstalled and now the app says it can't set up in English UK or English US, absoloute joke.",1
Since the past 4 days my Instagram feed is not updating. I always see the same posts which were posted 7 days ago. Reported this problem twice but still there is no action from their side. Please fix it!!!!,1
It's strange my network is alright i can watch reels and use other social apps as well but i can't send messages through IG there's a bug.,1
"When will you add the reply feature in messages? I've been waiting for it far too long now (this was on 2020!!.) The app is getting worst by the update,i was waiting for a sample feature in the messages section, which btw is in evey other app (reply to messages). Also lately loading anything in the app takes a long period of time. A little efforts will be very much appreciated, but it seems as if you don't care about user's experience at all. I'm Very disappointed.",1
I have been constantly trying to log into my account for 2 days but it's not logging in. My account is not banned or reported and still available on insta only yet i couldn't log into it. I don't know where to report this problem there isn't proper response too for all those emails.,1
"I am not able to access my full blocked list, it only shows the latest blocked account with a plus and I can't find the accounts which I blocked earlier, I have reported this issue but no response , I have been stuck at this problem for a month now.",1
"It was working well but suddenly my insta doesn't have the updated features even after updating it like I can't react in emojis to other people's message, I can't reply back to them etc. Pls look into it. Dear team Instagram, please fix this issue asap",1
"Cannot even load in Insta, when I open Insta, after the logo page is loaded, the screen goes black and nothing I do changes it. Even trying older APKs don't work, one of the versions that did work couldnt watch new videos. And when I updated from the older version, it says I'm logged out and have to login again, but goes straight to Blank screen..... this issue has been like this for 2 weeks since mid July.",1
"I didn't broke a single community guidelines or rules, but then suddenly the app gave me a message telling me that my account got suspended out of nowhere. This app won't even let me apeal or retrieve my account. I tried everything and try using my emails or linked accounts but nothing happened, it always says error and try again later.",1
"A recent bug makes it impossible to see the feeds. I have like loads of people I follow but after every second post I get the message ""you're all caught up"" which I know is a blatant lie. Time to leave Instagram.",1
"Cannot post photos. Fails too often, editing photos before posting is a nightmare. Drafts don't get saved and restored properly.",1
"My Instagram is not working from yesterday and i uninstalled it multiple times, clear cache and data, have good wifi speed still can't figure out what to do",1
Not capable to provide customer service. If we stuck somewhere no one will be there to help. Only automated answers are available. Such a bad experience every time.,1

"Defunct app. Been using insta for years and stopped once woke ideology and c0vid warning swarmed my screen. Now that Zuckerberg, who is going to jail, has given up on Facebook and insta, these apps have gone to hell and no longer work. I can't scroll, like things, post images in chats without some sort of glitch impeding my progress. Shame on this app. Shame on Facebook.",1
"The algorithm prevents me from seeing what I want to see, as well as prevents others from seeing my posts. The reels feature is STUPID, it never works properly (ie. Lags, crashes, music doesn't load, captions don't load, etc). For a platform that wants me to create more video, it's not making it convenient or enjoyable.",1
"I saw comments abt the blank white screen is spread across instagram user for the past view times and I am the new user who's experience that. I have another clue to you to fix the issue; before that was happen, the Reels gets error so many times & failed reels appear on the top. Restart app, restart the device, clear the data & even re-install the app doesn't work at all. It's stuck right after the logo show up then the screen keep showing white. Have no idea abt this.

My Instagram is stuck. I tried reinstalling but it won't work. It's stuck like there is no internet connection but new photos are coming in feed but only 2-3 after that there is loading below it. When I visit my primary it won't load all the reals shared by friends. Please help me,1
"Before yesterday it was a hasstle saving a reel in a category because you had to find the corresponding post and save that instead. Latest update makes it impossible to save a reel in a specific category, because the corresponding post is now the reel itself. OMG what aweird priority! Why not make it possible to save a reel in a category first?! Honestly upsettingly short sighted.",1
It's been about a week since Instagram hasn't been working. Everytime I open it I get a black screen. I uninstalled and reinstalled. Cleared all the cache. Restarted my phone. Logged out and back in the whole nine. It won't work. It's just a black screen. This is about the only app I use for communication so. I'm not the only one with this issue either. And I've updated too. Ever since it switched to meta both Facebook and Instagram have been taking a huge L.,1
"It's a shame when you start to lose your basic foothold on what made your platform sustainable. As fickle as loading times, content distortion or even censorship of viewing content. These crazy kids won't allow poor quality nor inferior standards. Its all about the now, Instagram you have sucked a big chunky spew and tried to pass it off as a burp. This blows chunks.",1
"Support doesn't even do support! I have been sending in reports for almost 2 WEEKS and I've heard NOTHING. My account can't post, like, comment, NOTHING. I have NO restrictions and NO warnings but IG isn't telling me what I did wrong. I keep getting a stupid message that says ""we restrict certain activity to protect our community"" BULLCRAP I've seen straight up p0rn and they're restricting me MOST LIKELY bc I spam liked my friends profiles. This app sucks and so does the support team I'm so done",1
"I am giving you 1 star üåü you know why because I have been using insta from 6 years and my profile is not getting grow , and one more thing you insta team when you are updating insta just do carefully there is so many issue when I make any reel I can hear my voice in perticular reels sound , why it is happening , Do something solve this issue",1
The app was working just fine until you all decided to update it and ruin it. It crashes every single time and I can't even access my messages IF I am able to open it for any length of time and I'm not getting notifications either. Ridiculous. Fix this. And here we go almost a year later still having the same issue post update. Shocker.,1
Fed up of insta literally!!!!!! I don't know but I'm facing so many problems while using the app. I'm literally STRUGGLING I SWEAR!!!!! What's wrong with insta God knows. I can't see messages I have to load the messages first then only I'm able to see them. I'm getting left out from the app after every 1 min or even after few secs of opening it. All goes either blank or it takes me to my homescreen straight Ugghhh I swear I'm donneee!!idk when this is going to fix but plssssss fix it asap!!!!,1
"THE CENSORSHIP IS RIDICULOUS!!!! The last update really ruined it, sticking ""suggested posts"" into the main feed is confusing and annoying. Tons of ads and suggested posts, I barely even see the people I actually follow. What's the point?.? I constantly have issues with the app not loading pics, I don't know if it's my phone or the app but sometimes it just leaves messages on ""sending"" for days.",1
Instagram please check my account. It dose not work properly from last two days . While I use it as app but when I log in on chrome it works properly. I think the application has any technical default.,1
Crashing so bad that I need to restart my phone. I think testers were not doing there work properly. Lot of bugs available in latest release. Fix these issues. My phone: Redmi note 8 pro,1

"Update: Continues super glitchy! Stop messing with our post visibility! Since Facebook purchased it, ig has gotten so glitchy, tone deaf about its audience wants and likes, and money hungry. Visibility for EVERYONE has gotten extremely low unless you pay or spend every day all day posting on this platform just like they did to those Facebook fan pages no one cares about anymore these days because of this very reason. This is the kind of thing that makes us go create and move to new platforms.",1

"Every feature they added is worst than the last. For about a year or more. I profundly hate the app, is like they made especially changes so they make sure i use it less, don't enjoy my time there and even more concerning engage with it less.",1
This app is suck. I'm experiencing a terrible bug where I'm trying to watch back my friend's previous story (the story just posted up 3 hours before) but it kept ignoring. I think you should fix it as fast as you could. It is a terrible experience for us if this bug still not fixed.,1
I cant see the notes of the people in my chat section. And i have no option to leave a note .after i updated the app i dont have note.i uninstalled and again installed but i cant have the note option,1

"There's not much to say about this app other than extremely annoying and stressful to use, these past few months. The DMs don't even work properly anymore, on mobile messages disappear that you've sent, and you can't even see other peoples messages, sometimes it takes hours or even days before they show up. That is unless you go onto desktop in which it actually has functional DMs, but you have even less features on desktop. Instagram explore page consistently resets to the basics. Fix the app.",1
"App has become completely unusable. Can't even open the app without it crashing 0.5 seconds in. Updated, reinstalled and cleared cache. Nothing has fixed it",1
"Getting worse and worse every update, fix the issue where posts are shown and then disappear after a few seconds and replaced with another post with the previous post nowhere to be found, this app is becoming annoying",1

"Can't crop videos anymore, app crashes when editing clip duration, can't add multiple videos in 1 clip. Watching other videos is worst now. I will try to watch a video twice, and it automatically moves me to the next one- even if I scroll back to the original video. Updated again: constant audio echo when trimming clips, eventually have to shut down then reopen app. Update: pixel editors are smoking even more crack designing this app.",1
"it ruins the quality of my photos and i have no clue why it does. it has been happening for around a week now, it was perfectly fine before this but now i can't post anything due to the awful quality. it ruins the colours and pixelates everything, it is nothing to do with the size of the images and i know that for sure. i have not seen this happen to anyone else's posts but it is just so extreme for me. i with i could include images in this so i could properly show how awful it is.",1
"When I post reels, the caption is deleted and it has no caption or tags anymore visible. This needs to be fixed!! I also don't like that the volume button activates the sound on a video!! So annoying!! If I have a yt video or music playing in the background and I want to turn up the volume, but there's a video on my screen in Instagram (Facebook too), it prioritizes the video and stops my music. I hate this. Remove this or add this as a setting option is settings so I can turn this off!!",1
"Waste app , i haven't been able to access my story archive and apply highlights in my profile, even though i have reported many times , no action has been taken to solve the issue, it keeps getting worse",1
"Everytime I view someone's page through a link, click on a photo, and then I go back , it exits the entire page. The only way I can get it to stop, is to manually search their name. That makes links not user friendly. Also, the homepage needs to stop refreshing so often, especially when you share something on the homepage.",1
"I've had the same account for YEARS! Today when opening the app it refused to allow me to look at insta without proving my email and phone number. Once I did that I've been locked out completely!

You guys need to fix your sharing stories tagging. It's not letting those that I tag in my stories share them anymore. I am only able to fix this by then going into my story settings once its been posted and tagging another person which is unnecessary and annoying. Please fix this,1
"What kind of stupid app is this I have been using the Instagram since 4years ago but eversince I updated it yesterday, I don't even have access to it again I have tried logging in but not working I even tried creating new account, they requested for strong password people cannot suggest and I also did that yet it kept showing password at least 6letters and number.",1
"It's a great app, but recently the bugs have been ruining the experience. It doesnt load messages or videos that I post or send and it's not a internet error.",1
Pathetic experience for such a big name Earlier instagram was fun Now it's full of glitches A. Unwanted add way too much B. Click on some reel and something all together shows C. No matter which preference you choose default earliest or newest it keep showing the same people in following list,1
"The latest update makes the app no longer recognize any photos or video on my phone. The only things recognized are those I've previously posted. However, if i go to add a story or reel, everything populates. Thing is: i don't want to post reels or stories. i want to post to my feed and share to other social media platforms. The latest update has also removed the sharing function from Facebook to Instagram.",1
Unusable. IG have changed to focus on reels rather than posts but most of the reels it presents don't actually display but simply forward me to the next set. And don't start me on an algorithm that presents 2 or 3 sponsored links or content (totally un)related to something I've watched. Scrolling through a video to get to interesting content does not count as watching,1
"Will crash if you scroll too hard, or sometimes just randomly crashes. Also, is it just me or this app really drains a lot of battery?",1
Can't upload videos/reels on one of my pages. It crashes. Even after restart and clear cache and clear storage. It is getting on my nerves. On Samsung 22 Ultra,1

Access data option is not there . It has been removed. That is a drawback of this app. I literally can't give 2 stars because it has so many bugs and two-factor authentication isn't working. It always shows issues after entering right code too. Access data feature should come back in newly updates otherwise any body can login my account. And my account is been logged in to my old devices without password after I formatted it and changed the password too. It is a drawback.,1
"I don't understand why is my Instagram not working properly all of a sudden. I'm not able to add songs to my story, I am not able to react and reply to the messages. It is very annoying.",1
"Recent update broke photo editor, I post multiple pictures but it posts them out of frame, the frame changes when you post if you tried to crop/edit your photo at all. Needs update.",1
Worst experience of any app ! I got my account hacked and the person who hacked it has linked a facebook with it and now I cant log back in cuz Instagram has removed the option to log in via text or email . Thank you for completely providing my acc to a hacker META!,1
"My account got hacked and Instagram has no help, no call center and only offered a terrible Ai that does nothing but lead me back to the help center. Also no help there.",1
It is a good app easy to use the reason for the one star is because of how many accounts their are of just sexual things posted and then when you report it nothing gets done about it it is so disgusting this app is slowly turning into port hub with all the accounts of just nudity.,1
"I do not know what is happening. I have installed and uninstalled this app a few times so it can work. After installation it works with the Wifi, give it a few minutes the pages will not load. I have to switch to my data in order to load. I know it is not the wifi's problem because every other app works great.",1
The app is going worst day by day. There are lots of bugs and problems i am facing in it .very annoying and disappointing.,1
"I would like it if there was a button that you could press that could remove all the posts that you've liked....but u r also able to press the pictures that you want to keep.....also it won't let me dislike any photos now (because it said I'm temporarily blocked), I've been blocked for 16 hours now. 1 star now",1
"Its forcing me to verify my phone # by using a code. It won't send the code and it isnt letting me use any other of the app's features, such as looking at reels or my home page. Instagram will open trying to get me to verify my phone # while I'm on other apps. The tech is also terrible as well.",1
I don't normally write reviews but this app has ran so poorly over the past two months I needed to say something. It sometimes takes DAYS to load. Tried everything. Restarting my phone. Checking the wifi emptying the cache and still freezes. The only option that works is to uninstall and reinstall. I've used Instagram since 2012 and I'm shocked by how poorly it runs now.,1
The count which indicates likes of reels is not showing. Useless app. Instead of adding new features an bugs. Keep the same an good one,1
"I have 2 accounts, one for personal and one for my nail business. However, there are always so many glitches when I try to do just ONE post. I can have my captions missing after posting, or mysteriously disappearing, the images being very fuzzy after being posted, the post being removed just because I tagged my friends and the list goes on. Like seriously frustrating just having to do ONE post over and over again and sometimes I just gave up. Worse, I wrote in many times and no one replied.",1
My swipe up reply is not working from when I installed this app... And i have reported many a times... The theme is also not applying for me... Very unsatisfied,1
"App updated on 9/20/2022 and was semi-working but with some glitches like a video would start to play but the visual screen would pause and the audio would play. Or the screen would glitches when trying to swipe up to view posts. Well today 9/22/2022 the app will open, load the main screen and if I try to swipe or view stories the app crashes and closes. Every so often I try to click a story and it loads with the ""Now you can like stories..."" then crashes and closes.",1
"My Instagram account messanger is not updated. I cant use swep reply . And I am spending lote of time in Instagram. I put a lot of complaint reports but no one listened to Instagram, I didn't like you because it doesn't solve the problem. I am very disappointed for him.",1
It laggs a lot and there is some new error that happens when I try writing a comment it doesn't show me the bar that has the words but shows it only after I put an emoji I don't know why this happens also it sometimes gets white mode when I'm on dark mode and I can't see comments or number of likes or bio etc.,1
"Before latest update it was good app. After update it is not working properly, on refreshing the DM is loading endlessly, even reels are not loading",1
"It was absolutely great until a month or 2 ago. Started getting a black screen when opening the app. Tried re-installing, clearing cache, clearing data, and it's done nothing. Updated the game and still nothing has been done about it. Getting really tired of this honestly",1
"The last few updates have done absolutely nothing for my phone. About four updates ago, I cleared up the data for the app to clear up some space on my phone and when I tried to log back into the app, the logo popped up and then it changed to a black screen and just stayed there. Since then, I've had the exact same issue and haven't been able to use the app at all. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, restarting my phone to see if that was the problem, etc. to no avail. Please fix this!",1
"Crazy how you can delete my review, but you can't fix the problem. Just don't even bother downloading this app because it's trash now. It was once good, but since they changed some things it goes to white screen and doesn't open. There is no tech support and noone is going to fix the bugs.",1
"From last month feeds were not refreshed. But from today not able to open app at all. If I try to open I am getting following error """"Instagram"" failed to start several times. Restore it by clearing its history?""",1
ALL ADS!!! I barely ever look at instagram. I share an account with my wife and once every few months I like to catch up. So when I click on view older posts I ONLY see ads. Literally 1 in 30 will be an actual post. It's not instagram at all anymore üíî,1
"I have been experiencing this error on primary messages lately. Like, someone who reacted to your story or directly messaged you is not reaching you right away even though your wifi is working so well. You may be able to read it after a few hours, and the worst case is after 3 days. I was just looking at the recent reviews. And many people experienced it as well. And I just want to complain here for you to notice and fix it right away.",1
"It's getting worse day by day....if I open dms, my chats are not visible and I Don't have a slide and reply option too...I can't post my reel in one go it lagged...fix this thing before we shift to another app",1
Everytime when my followers come up to 500+ something happens like instagram blocked my account for 3days after that instagram blocked my account again not only after that when I login It says confirme that its your account bla bla etc.... so many problems reporting a problem is a time wasted after report a problem nothing happens so you all don't wasted your time on this app focus on study.,1
"No notifications means no notifications. If I turn notifications off, that should automatically mean no reminders. I shouldn't have to dig around to turn off a second option.",1
No issue with the functionality. Just how it's turned into a barrage of tedious garbage with seemingly no personal targeting. Instagram thinks we're all mindless teens with nothing better to do than watch senseless nonsense. No value to it at all.,1
My phone is Vivo T1 5G 8 GB variant. In my phone I am facing issue like reels videos are not playing properly. It feels like videos goes less frames per second. Fid it asap.,1
"Instagram's usability is continuously degrading. I just want to share photos and it seems every month a new issue pops up that prevents me to do so. Uploading multi-imgae posts breaks it. Using tilt shift breaks it. Using multiple filters breaks it. Now it won't access my phone's gallery, only showing 30 images to select from.",1
"for the past few months I can't see my pictures while posting either a story or on feed. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, I have tried everything but to no avail.",1
Not sure what happened with the last update- cannot size pictures when uploading any longer and with multiple pictures. I don't even want to post to IG now bc of the headache from this.,1
Still lot of glitches... - Reels/editing keeps hanging the application. - application closes suddenly - photos croped differently after posting. And lot more..,1
The reels nowadays just stop in between and it's getting annoying now. My network is good but still it happens . The photos also just show loading sign. i am hoping things get fixed fast.,1
A once great app. Zuckerberg of course can't leave anything Alone so instead of seeing pictures of my friends and my family seeing this curated nonsense that I don't want to sleep. I hardly even go on Instagram I hardly post pictures. It's just a garbage app,1
"If you like adverts and irrelevant video clips, this is the app for you. I used to like seeing my friends' photos, but this now seems impossible....",1
"When I tried opening the account, it is not even showing any option to login or signin. I can not able to access anything from last few weeks. I tried clearing datas and cache, uninstalled and installed many times, rebooted my device multiple times yet no use. Reported to Instagram as well, yet no steps taken. Would be better if they take steps to set all the bugs.",1
"Comments now pop up while you watch videos and it is so annoying. Support is terrible, they have not checked one of my complaints and send a standard response telling me they didn't check anything. There seems to be no way to get help with the comment issue. The algorithm used to suggest videos is terrible, their ""fact checker"" is laughable, and they are pushing Covid-19 like a Colombia cartel.",1
"I have two accounts and for some reason, the other one doesnt get some features like the note while the other one is just fine. How does that even happen? Tried logging in and out to reinstalling everything and still the same",1
"It is allow me only one time to see what's going on in insta. When I exit insta and come back after some time it's not working. I did so many times mobile restart, app uninstall and reinstall. But no use. Can you plz help me what happened to my Instagram?",1
"The unwanted suggestions via the algorithmic feed may be why I choose another app to keep up with family and friends. It's also become increasingly hard to simply post high quality photos on the app. Going back to basics would really help the app design, but not the ads so I understand the tension but I think I may just not keep IG into the future.",1
"The fact that no one responds to e-mails or reports for supports is just sad!, Instagram is becoming problematic, my personal account has recently been hakked and Iv had no help what so ever, everyone I send out a report I just get a thanks for making Instagram better, Iv had my personal account for years all I want is for Instagram to help me get it back, but it's such a stupid process, at help centre it says you can submit videos and selfies as well as ID BUT HOW DOES ONE EVEN DO THAT.",1
I am not able to upload story or post or video . I have tried many times it's just showing blank when I select the pic .,1
"Everytime the app updates, I'm unable to put on ads. Budget adding page does not load, it always shows error",1
"So many bugs. Not able to add name in the bio. Wanted to change it but shows that the name can be changed twice within 14 days, though I haven't changed it.",1
Half to 75% of video shorts have major playback errors in latest updates. Most will play sound but freeze 2 seconds into the clip. No means of clearing Instagram cache,1
Nothing but issues with the latest updates. Can't send videos or photos through chat. I am seeing so many ads and things that I am just not interested in. The bots are out of control. Please get your $#!t together!!,1
"1) Everytime when I upload a reel, after editing, it sounds okay. But after uploading, it loses its background sound. The song name and tags are there but it's inaudible. Also IG adds more noise to the reel. So I'd to delete the reel after uploading. It's been a week like that. 2) After adding a song to story, the quality of photo, video, and text written becomes very low.",1
Someone hacked and deleted my main account the account I had more than 5 years ago and have all my freinds and memories and now simply thry are telling me to go Creat a new one cause they're useless and can't helpe. Like Excuse me? why creating a new one if it might get hacked again and lose all my memories and no one in insta cares or try to help they just sent me to read some useless letters!? Like no your app is useless and I will never creat a new account!,1
"Instagram wants to be Tiktok so hard it no longer allows you to see old timeline posts. Literally there is no option, only 10 second clips of nonsense you didn't subscribe to.",1
"It is so messed up, i didn't use my instagram account for 7 months and recently when i logged in, instagram disabled my account for no reason and it is not even enabling my account, i am not at all happy with this. I want instagram team to take an immediate action on this and enable my account as soon as possible.",1
"One of the worst apps I've used so far, it has countless glitches they never even bother to fix. App would've been a lot more better only if they looked after it a bit more and actually tried to fix things.",1
"What's happening with this app? Constantly crashes, I can't edit the 2nd and the rest of the pictures. It only let's me to edit the 1st picture.. Why? Why?",1
"Instagram has lot's and lot's of privacy issues , 2 weeks ago my account got hacked after which I tried to report my account but I have received no response from the team . The hacker is still using my account and posting some random stuffs which is totally not acceptable. I'm still waiting for the response from Instagram team.",1
"The worst experience..I'm facing troubles from last 6 days it's always showing that ""Instagram has stopped working"" i hv enough data enough storage.. everything is fine yet it is not working ..what the hell ?? I want my Instagram back !!!",1
My account was disabled for no reason at all I barely post I'm cant sign in and it say my username phone number and email is not found in the system which is Bs I have had my account for over 10yrs and no it disabled and I can't get in contact with customer service to see why I was disabled. I have years of pictures on there,1
"I am not able to log in to my account. It showed that I am suapended for the next 30 days. When I disagreed to it, it just logged me out and now I can not even log in and when I try to change my password it shows user not found. Please help.",1
Very poor app because doesn't work network and face many issues my experience was very bad that's why I am say you don't download Instagram and give him very bad feedback and don't give one star also,1
"I can't send messages to the sponsor account, I can't send messages to any business account! I reported the problem several times and nothing happened! Besides, many problems we face all the time as Instagram users we have alot of troubles....",1
"This app is seriously annoying as soon as it's updated theres always a problem, my videos are now appearing as photos, now I can't restore my deleted posts cause it's not loading in the deleted section but it shows that it's there, The videos too don't constantly play, have to keep on at it, I don't get any notifications saying I received a message unless I open the app! If I report a problem it always fails, and only when I send a feedback it works, it's horrible and becoming bad to worse!",1
"Changed my password because i forgot and now it won't let me log in on any sort of device, app or website. Please fix the bug as soon as possible. If i knew then i shouldn't have changed my password in the first place üôÑ I'm having troubles of logging in and it says error",1
"Instagram is not work No posting, no pics and it's been 3,4 months It's happening... it's going on so much: that tell me if 2 time install uninstall then there is no good response",1
"I used to love this app and I love that it's trying to protect my account, but when I can't log in because I got my phone number changed and now I can't log in. I'm tired of trying to get it back, I'm just deleting the app now.",1
"Not the best experience, you cannot share more than one photo after the last update and you can share none directly from ig. It's been a week... And don't get me started about sharing stuff between ig and fb. They have the same owner, basically it is the same app but they cannot figure out the most basic function half the time. Underwhelming",1
The app hasn't been working properly for a while. Nothing loads or posts and story have been posting upside down. I get dm notifications but when I go into my DMS nothing loads or opens please fix this asap,1
Bad app the security is garbage someone just hack into my account it use to be simple to get it back but mark zuckerburg is making it impossible to get your account would not recommend it hope you happy mark you lost a valuable costomer,1
"Drafts are glitchy, when I scroll to fast and touch a reel, it freezes, but plays the audio. The only way for it to not do it is scroll down and up to that same reel. Recently, I'm unable to like any post because for some reason I get the ""restrict certain activity to protect our community"" by just liking any posts. EVEN MY OWN. And it all started when I clicked the draft button. Had to restart my phone for insta to work.",1
"Compared to Facebook, it feels like one needs an advanced degree to use this forum. I HATE it, but unfortunately, it's a necessity.",1
From 10 -12 days Instagram is showing me You've Completely caught up. I am not able to see my feed. I am very frustrated with this issue. I have reported to Instagram but no one have reply yet . Pls fix this bug . I am not able to used my Instagram from 10 - 12 days .,1
"For some weird reason, whenever people send me messages, I don't get any notification. Instagram always has some type of glitch or error. I mean it's ridiculous",1
"Since the last few update Instagram is not working properly. The notes option disappeared, I multiple times uninstalled the app and reinstalled it again but nothing changed I'm still not getting the notes update and then yesterday Instagram blocked few activities on my account such as I cannot like or follow or unfollow some one as they say I've been using 3rd party applications to gain like and followers which I am literally not interested into It would be a real favour if you guys work on this",1
Getting worst day by day. Even basic features doesn't work properly. All the new updates are have too many bugs.,1
"I've been hacked and I've tried following the help center to recover, I've sent video verification 4 times and they keep getting denied!! This is MY account! IG needs to do better with this!! What else can I do to prove it's me?? And no one to actually speak with.",1
Now it's getting annoying. It's been two days and my insta couldn't even update the feed. My network is working fine with all other apps but insta is stuck. Just do something or I'm deleting,1
"when i change accounts the updates aren't the same on both accounts. for example i cant access the ""tap in"" function on one account but on another i can :/ edit: TERRIBLEEEE i cannot use so many new functions on other accounts even if i have the functions on another account like what EDIT AGAIN... : i deleted and reinstalled this app multiple times and ive literally gone back in time i dont even have reels anymore what",1
User can not share a post with comment! The bug has been there for years in it is happening on all the Android phones! Millions of people using just this function. It is so annoying that you don't even think about fixing it!,1
"This app doesn' t support for Android users. I use both Iphone 13 pro max and Sumsung S22. But when I posted reel , It works well on Iphone. However, in android when I add the music in reel and look at the preview, it seems fine. But when it is posted for, the music didn't appear and it also had terrible noise in the reel. What a junk app!!",1
"I can't use the app. My feed doesn't show, I can't send anything, I'm not able to recieve messages. Absolutely nothing is happening in the App. Tried restarting the phone, logging out the account, uninstalling the app and installing it back. But still nothing works. It's been 2 months I'm facing this problem now. I can't even report my issue nowü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1
As of the latest update I have been loggedout morethan 20 times. Please fix whatever bug is causing this. Very annoying!!!,1
I don't like this app because in my Instagram account the reel is not starting and I can't scroll and I am showing live from other I'd as I am not performing live from last 1 week so please solve this problem üò°üò°ü§¨,1
"Latest update has something wrong. Feed isn't updating properly, I did all the troubleshooting tips Instagram suggests and still either only getting posts from one page in my feed, or only posts from 5 days ago. Please fix!",1
"I don't want to review anything but want to share the worst experience..i was normally using Instagram suddenly a message has popped saying disagree or disobey..And after some time my account got blocked saying that i did not followed guidelines ..what kind of guidelines i need to follow??i m trying to log in back in my account,,but no response..i want immediate solution for these...kindly look into it on priority",1
App freezes when an Instagram sponsored poll appears and you try to click on the three dots on the top right corner of the post. I'd rather not have any polls appear if that happens,1
"Get rid of the loading error. What's this all the time?; When I go in to upload a story, 8 out of 10 doesn't even recognize the gallery and it takes a whole day to load, fxxk. really. so what do you want me to do with this app? DO SOMETHING DUDE.",1
"Bad experience happened with me, like i changed my phone when I try to connect i'm obliged to get a login code in my phone number when it never comes to begin with. How i'm supposed to connect to my damn account. Even with sending video proof you didn't approve it.",1
I don't understand why there's no chat theme option im my insta + i can't slide message anyone!! I don't want to use this app anymore. This is not right. I've even sent feedback to insta but still there is no response. Please take this seriously and fix it for everyone!!! Edit: still no response??? * Uninstalled*,1
"As of right now, the main attraction of Instagram is that you'll get too many bugs, I have complained but nothing happened, it just keeps getting worse, they should improve the user experience rather than introducing new bugs every update...",1
"What's the problem with my ig story? Can't even upload any continuous videos. Don't ask me to update to latest version. I always update, but no improvement at all. Baik tak payah update langsung. Edited: Come back here to comment this app so sucked! Suddenly suspend my acc without any valid reason. Give me my acc back!",1
"Facing problems with Instagram for more than 8-9 hours now. It is not loading content, my messages vanished, unable to load stories or reels or even my profile page..major issues!!",1
"It has so much error going on it , doesn't work properly , so much nonsence , post any thing it goes full green , put video it also goes full green i can only see reel on it.",1
New issues for me now I can't follow anyone it keeps canceling on its own. I just liked a few photos and I was action blocked by Instagram. This app is completely unusable at this point. Please fix your app! It's getting worse day by day..,1
One of the wrost app i have ever used it have thousands of glitches and bug and all the time in this app numerous types of problems bugs glitches are coming and app is not running smoothly kindly look into this matter @instagram and solve the bug and glitches.,1
"Edit:8/10/2022: it was working fine for a while. Now all of a sudden I get a black screen. It crashes when I try to post stories. It drops quality horribly when I try to post and/or it'll show a black screen or completely white screen. Updates, restarting my phone, clearing the cache and data have done nothing. Fix this pls.",1
Fix please this glitch:- You cant snd message for three days This glitch happened just for sending a man's photo ro others. It says it goes against community guidelines. We don't see anything wrong there. My friends will also delete if u dnt fix this glitch. Only 1 star rating for such a worst glitch.,1
Stalls quite a bit these days. I have to uninstall app and use website on my phone for a few days when it does this. Very inconvenient.,1
The app is so buggy it drives me crazy...I constantly have to close and reopen it. Stop investing in the metaverse and please improve the usability of the app.,1
I want to open Instagram after I finish all the necessary things required and I waiting for it to open another thing I see is that something went wrong up till it have not open .,1
It's too cheap It shows fake advertisements. It promotes all the fake sites . I recommend you to be very careful while you are using Instagram. I have lost my money from one of the advertisement on Instagram üò°ü§¨üò°ü§¨ I want to contact with the owner of Instagram üòë,1
The app is always glitching and crashing and it's buggy. Crashes ever day and the messages don't send,1
"Latest bug means messages have randomly stopped sending from my phone. Just sits there as ""sending"". I've had to use the desktop site. Update did nothing to help. Specific profiles too - some people get messages, some don't. Everyone gets them on desktop. No issues with data on phone - everything else works. Plus now it force feeds you cringey reels. I avoid tiktok because I don't want to see that garbage, IG is trying to copy.",1
"I am an sportsperson who uploads training reel ,i am uploading so many good reels for last 2years but my reels don't get any reach at all . Which looks like so much manipulated ,that it will not get any reach at all whatever you do . I don't recommend this app at all .",1
"In the most of the time when I started to upload a Reel, after finishing it shows its uploading still now and I can't use any other account and other apps.. Please try to make it fast, We can't waste such a huge time..",1
"My account is not working efficiently, my refresh option is not available . And how much i report on the help centre of the Instagram , it is not working! It showing bug also recently.",1
Hasn't refreshed my feed in a week. Super irritated I did nothing wrong. It won't even let me login from another device to fix the problem. Just glitches and says instagram cannot handle this request. I'm beyond irritated all my info is on this app.,1
The update messaging option is missing even after you upload to the new version.. So you can't reply to specific message if you live In the UK from what I've read on forum its not available for Europe and uk.. Also Sent messages to Instagram asking for help on the matter no reply yet..,1
"After every post, there is one ad or suggested posts. This is just too much ad that it becomes spam.... I am beginning to subconsciously ""blacklist"" all those brands I see on the ads...",1
I have an account that I don't have access to because it has been hacked and knowing I can't delete or add any of my pictures to or from that account sucks. Instagram needs to do better with security. They was able to hack my email and password...,1
"My favorite features are it crashing 70% of the time I try using it , video calls being low quality and Also crashing or just auto hangs up , and videos just straight up not playing",1
"What is wrong with Instagram? My account is hacked and I just cannot reset it. Everytime I do the facial recognition thingy, the app crashes. It keeps stopping. What is this behaviour?",1
It sucks! It won't refresh and I don't want to create another one. This social network sight also has way to many fake accounts. Plus all the accounts of females trying to sell nudes or whatever is ridiculous anymore. Clean up your social network.,1
"Good app and all but would b nice to use it... I can't even open it, every time I try to it kicks me out, I tried uninstalling it and it didn't work before I'd uninstalled it I could not even go to my chats but now it won't even fully open",1
Absolutely zero customer support. They've blocked my account for the last month straight. For some reason the algorithm that runs the app for them thinks I'm a bot or something. And there's no way for me to prove otherwise. Which means I'm just not allowed to use my account. I've been banned every week for a month. This app is garbage.,1
"Even though I have already read my messages, Instgram keeps marking them all as unread. Personally, its very annoying for me and in group chats, I have to keep scrolling all the way down to the bottom. Quality is absolutely horrible. Only good for actually posting and staying in touch with friends. Instagram, get your stuff together and fix it.",1
Suddenly today I got suspended by Instagram for no reason.. and it's not helping me anyhow to log in even through the facebook account..whereas my facebook account is working fine.. Instagram not even give any valid reason to suspend me. I am totally surprised all of a sudden how it can happen??,1
"Worst experience using this instagram, too many glitches and lagging alot. Frequently reporting the problem and uninstall then re-install all possible options tried but no use, worst customer experience. From last 3 updates it ruining customer experience. If there was and option to give no stars , i would have given that.",1
"Not able to see some profile, the more simple is the app, the more it is used. More choices, more confusion = Less usage and retention of App. -> Lot's of Advertisment",1
Very pathetic! I am trying to open instagram but in every 4-5 days coming OTP verify and if i am trying to verify otp is not coming on my number. I have also mailed this issue but as expected NO RESPONSE.! Also tried everything restart mobile uninstall and re-install app but not resolved. Please fix this issue.,1
Terrible platform! Used to be great now it has just become a selling page for only fans. Tried to delete my account and they make it impossible to find. You can't delete your page on the app so go to website and can't find it on there either,1
"Since the new update, the sticker option to put music for stories is no more and can no longer give variety emoji react to messages. Bring back the previous features plz.",1
"Posts, stories and reels are not loading. It shows 'tap to try again' but still won't load. Thought it's my connection that's not working but other apps that require internet are perfectly running fine. Already reported this twice on their help center/support but it's almost been a week and it's still like this. Have tried clearing cache and data and even reinstalling the app but still experiencing the same problem. Hope this will be fixed. Will uninstall this app for now.",1
"Logged out and now I can't log back in. The security code I need is not being sent to me via text or email, backup codes are not working, and there's no way to contact Instagram staff. Absolutely horrible.",1
"App genuinely stopped working (messages). My messages would send but would not be received, and I would get notifications about messages but when I check they are gone.",1
"IG Reels/Videos ignore mute setting on Android. I don't understand since other apps stay silent when I have the sound muted, but IG ignores the setting completely. Starting to use IG less and less about to delete the app.",1
"The app claims that my account doesn't exist despite being able to log on my computer. Error occurs when I try to restart the password, for two days it tells me to try again in a few minutes, can't find this problem anywhere in the support faq , so thanks Instagram.",1
Can't report fraud and/or Spam Accounts. That Will improve the platform for sure ü§°ü§°ü§° Stop putting videos (advertisements!!!) In my feed/ recommendations - especially when I use mobile data.... ffs why are so many people I my feed I don't follow? My feed is almost just people I don't care about. Why aren't folders in an ALPHABETIC order !?!?!? The sorting doenst make sense you give me to choose ...,1
I was logged out of my account for no reason and i can't log back in. When i try to log in it tells me to try again in a few minutes or to check my internet connection when i have a strong and good internet connection and its telling me that my username does not belong to any account which is very confusing. Please work on this ASAP!,1
"Updates are not available to everyone. I deleted the app and downloaded it again, but the updates still not downloading.",1
"No longer a good app, there's just way too many glitches to ignore and the personal feed isn't correcting itself to what you like, it's just feeding you random unrelated garbage no matter how many times you press ""hide post"". Best to use this app only for business and not for personal use.",1
"Setting the ethics of shadow banning content creators and letting people troll/harass with no repercussions and the blind eye to the bots plaguing the software as of late aside, the app itself simply doesnt work since the last update. Pctures dont load in. Stories don't load in. Double notifications for everything. Late notifications for requests. ""Ghost"" notifications that dont show up at first but then appear 3 days later. The app is a mess, and so are the people running it.",1
"Everytime i try to post the story it doesn't get uploaded nor can delete and can't log out either, i reported many times still they are not fixing it, so my rating of this app goes 1, if there was an option i wouldn't have given the 1 star either and not only this the Instagram is going worse n worse",1
Deactivated my account no legitimate reason. Went through all the verification processes again. Everything checked out. However I can no longer login to the application. I'm deleting it from my phone,1
"This is totally absurd. I just installed the app . The lastest version. And the explore option is gone ! On the bottom row I can only see the home page , reels ,creat a new post , activity and the profile option. Please fix this bug . No matter how many times I reinstall or update the app this bug just doesn't seem to go away",1
This is the app from hell along with FB. I have 3 accs 2 of those got hack & the stupid help support keeps asking me for the password I don't have because obnoxiously the hackers chage it. I just want to delete all my info & pics from there but they don't have live support who can handle these issues. They will never become TT no matter how hard they want to copy it. At least TikTok takes the time to answer any issues I have a d takes security seriously when it comes to acc safety.,1
So many bugs are there. Sometimes i get irritated with these. Also i can't see many new features. Even i reinstalled and updated the many times. Even there is no response for complaints,1
There are a couple of things they need to work on and first how to contact them! Second fix all the glitches. I can't see anything on my account it is now blank! About done with the App and lack of caring from Facebook Customer Service!,1
"It suspended my accounts the moment I made them, making the app unusable. I would repeal the suspense, be prompted with it asking for my email, I would give my email, it would ask for a code, and I would give it. Then it would do the same thing, but for my phone number, It would ask for a code that it supposedly sent, but I would never receive it. Even after repeatedly asking for a new code.",1
"Since two weeks, app has become the worst not showing the notification and messages are been delayed. Automatically getting all notification at once. Please fix it.",1
"No way to prevent notifications from ""people you may know"", especially when they are always random people you don't know.",1
"Images keep failing to load, the sound turns on randomly. Almost like The company that created this app, can't seem to maintain it.",1
"Frame rate drops when using camera for story or reels. Seriously developer guys why is that? I understand you use more resources for IOS but many people choose to use android phones and there are so many issues! At least resolve issues for flagship phones that have high ram and fast processors. I use s21 on year 22. Having this issue making my videos look like from 5 years ago. Seriously, this do not happen on tiktok. Better solve this kind of problems if you wanna stay in the business..",1
"This is getting on my nerves. I dont know what is happening but lately is nearly impossible to post anything. It gives me an error every time I try to post a picture. I deleted the app cache (several times), restarted my phone, disconnected and connected to the wifi.... and nothing works.",1
"I love instagram so much.. my IG has been refusing to work for the past two days, all it's saying is that it can't reload my feed, when I go to my activity, just anything basically on the app it just refuses to work, it's really annoying and I don't know what to do. Your apps keep crashing everytime I try to use it, it's really getting annoying, please fix your glitches",1
The reply option in messager is not working in my mobile. I had raised complaint so many times but the Instagram doesn't take care about it.,1
"Idk if it was the last update that did this but I have no new updates, and same happened to me as those below: constantly crashing I couldnt press one button without it crashing and NOW!? My reels drafts are GONE- disappeared. I have looked everywhere. They aren't where Google says they should be, they aren't where they have been for the past year of me doing reels. This is extremely inconvenient for creatives, now my page interactions are going to suffer bc I can't post the one thing y'all want",1
"I'm Instagram user back from 2016 , using this app on a daily basis just from the past 8days I'm facing a major issue like whenever I open up the application it just shows a black or a white screen and nothing else I'm not directed to the login page or so... I logged in through my computer and checked that my account is working perfectly fine but then also the application on my phone didn't work at all. Likewise, I restarted my device, installed and unistalled it but no results so far.",1
"I haven't been able to view comments on instagram for two weeks now. Posts say the comments are there, go to click, nothing pops up. Google says its either poor internet (not, reset router and have 5G) or a bug. I don't want to continue using an app I can't use to communicate. Absolutely absurd. I have uninstalled and reinstalled just in case, nothing. Its all the same. This app has gone down the drain.",1
Pleasee solve myy problem..Can't follow anyone on Instagram since last 2 weeks..only try again later appear..on screen restrict certain activity is written..please take an action and find the solution.. pleasee...A huge request to youu,1
"Instagram has gone to the dumps. My business account is so buggy. When I try to add a story, it goes blank half the time. Instagram is not allowing me to search for songs in reels and stories due to some bug. Despite reporting it SO MANY TIMES, Instagram really doesn't care. Absolutely disappointed with their product and their absent support. What a horrible, horrible app",1
"I am giving this a one star because Instagram isn't anymore like what it used to be. I've reels on my page that am uninterested in and reported multiple times, I can't share a song from Spotify in the stories and it HANGS. I've a literally brand new phone but it still hangs. I am unable to upload a reel in my stories instead of a post. Wth is wrong? And almost everything is going wrong in Insta. Fix the freaking irritating issues please",1
Fix the app so it's optimized for Z Flip 3. It glitches carousel posts and when you go to your profile it shows random posts rather than the usual recent posts. It also cuts out parts of reels and doesn't fit on the screen. And it doesn't even push out your posts anymore without having to pay. Edit: now it's corrupting Reels audio...,1
"One big issue that needs fixing: song unavailable - Instagram needs to implement a function so that when songs become unavailable due to licensing restrictions etc., it allows users to select alternative audio. Will adjust to 5 stars when this function becomes available. Many other creators are becoming frustrated by this.",1
"Too many bugs like pinning posts most of the time not working/not showing it saved on any collection, sometimes I see comments not posted even when it shown it posted when I refresh the page and so on... But kost annoying part is the Phone become hot and slow whenever Instagram is open and I have to force close it. Old versions like V150.. don't have any of these bugs and it run very fast and cool on my Samsung note 10 plus so, obviously the problem is with your newer versions.",1
"The algorithm ruins what used to be an enjoyable app. Now very little of my posts are viewed or liked, and those I want to see are now never shown. Every 3 posts on my home page is either an ad or someone else's content I don't follow, so it's basically pointless in following people if you're seeing a lot of content that you don't follow. Terrible app.",1
"Currently i don't know why you guys are rolling out 2 versions, i download my Instagram and get any of the 2 versions at random, the old one with the black coloured background theme is working fine, but the blue background version always fails, sometimes by not logging in or sometimes by just not starting, i hope you guys fix this soon, also the blue colored in not looking that good",1
This app gets worse and worse with every new update none of the reels i get are even related to what i like. The not intrested function doesn't work as i still see those same reels anyways. Now i have to keep refreshing to send messages as they just say sending for 5-10 minutes. I've started to hate this app more and more and only use it as there isn't any worthwhile replacement for it. It has been less than a day since I posted this review and it has gotten even worse. Thank you Instagram,1
"After uninstalling and then reinstallation the login page doesn't show up. It's just a blank white screen on opening Instagram. Instagram lite is working fine. Tried many ways- restarting device etc. But nothing worked. Facing this since the past few days. It's working fine on my friends devices... Whatever's the issue, Kindly fix it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...",1
Edit: One month & 10 days later the app still not workingüò≠. How many times do you want me to keep reinstalling the app? I have reported the issue through the web because i have been unable to log in using the main app. It has been showing white blank space for the past 72hrs now. I have done everything needed to solve the issue but still doesn't work. Fix it!!!,1
It was pretty good at first but now - the algorithm is pretty messed up! My reel feed is just filled up with a lot of random people's reels and the usual reels I see are gone now. This used to happen before and it would return to normal after a few hours but now it's been more than a week and it's still messed up!,1
"Not sure how many years it will take for your team to rectify the serious issue of the app crashing whenever a page's insights are viewed from an android phone. It's been months since this issue began, and it seems like Instagram is in no mood to solve it. If it's not in your control, maybe just make this application usable for Iphone users only, as the glitch is active for Android users only. Pathetic!",1
It reports you for things that doesn't even tell you what you're going against Community guidelines for and there's constantly reports or the apps don't work there's constant harassment by creeps it's been saying that I've been reported for something that I posted that goes against Community guidelines I haven't even posted anything haven't even commented on anything in 3 days and there is no way to contact poster symbol support step to call and you're put on hold for hours,1
"Recently your explore page is something like 60% ad content. You already have the shop section to promote content like this, so it's inappropriate to flood the explore with overwhelmingly content of that nature. Your suggestion function also continually shows really body toxic ads and content regardless of how many times a person has flagged that stuff as ""not interested"". Your algorithm is either not functioning or the protections you suggest that you have in place are a complete lie.",1
"What the heck is this. This app after the update allows to upload the full video in the story but when I deleted it and reinstall after some days i can't uplod the full reel Or download the video and when I try to repeat the reel to get the full video but it only plays the first part of that, make that correction immediately. üò°ü§¨(many more thing to complain but not enough capacity to typing üò°ü§¨)",1
"I've been using this app for so how many years yet this is the first time I'll complain and will rate this a 1 star. From the fonts that has been unreadable when I always upload my stories, from the theme that automatically changed when I go to my inbox and to the inbox that always have a problem when sending messages and the sending button suddenly went gone, and for the last time, the app is always lagging as hell :(( pls fix this asap!",1
"For the past few months I've had issues with adding music to pictures in personal chat as it blacks out my screen and kicks me out of Instagram when doing so. I've tried contacting help support but no efforts made. If it's possible, please fix this! It's an ongoing problem for months now since July.",1
"I love using ig, but in the past few days it went down af!! Instagram is very silent about this issue which is very trashy attitude from a company under Meta! I hope this fix NOW! It's very frustrating to open an app then you can't see other people's posts or stories. Which sometimes, I had a very anxious feelings about it. Instagram is my go to place whenever Im bored, but now it's a piece of trash because of ""down"" going on. I hope Instragram will fixed this!",1
"Ever since Facebook took over, this all has become exponentially more buggy as time goes on. An ongoing issue I've been putting up with is the light/dark themes glitching and putting the light grey dark theme text over the white light theme background essentially unreadable. That was fine, but now Instagram stories skip to the next one immediately as soon as I tap it. Almost like the timer was set to zero. This means that stories are unusable now.",1
"In fairness the app is more buggy than an ant farm. Listing all the issue, an the even poorer fix advice, would result in the loss of your own precious time. Hint hint. I dunno. Thanks for making a decent connective image app. On the other hand. The way it runs is actually now unusable.",1
"Terrible app and almost impossible to delete your account, don't believe me try it you can't even do it through the app.",1
"The experience with Instagram is pathetic. Every day there is a new issue. DM is not working, account gets blocked. Really upset with Instagram.",1
"The app doesn't give me an option to turn the volume up or down when sharing songs from spotify to my story. The other day I tried to share a song and I could see the speaker icon, but the app would crash before letting me do anything. Now I don't get even see the speaker icon... üòí",1
I am a regular user of Instagram but since 1 month I am not able to follow anyone neither are they able to follow me please help me out I haven't done anything that would break the guidelines. Please fix the issue as soon as possible.,1
"Every time a try to post a video on reels that looks perfectly fine on my phone... Instagram post it on bad quality, i already tried many options but this keeps happening",1
Why is there no option to edit your comments? Why should one have to delete the whole comment and retype? Also. Why is my feed automatically scrolling up and updating when I'm watching something? Edit: still garbage. The reels do not play fully. They get stuck. On a high speed Internet! The app is still occupying loads of storage. But then it doesn't work! Edit: crashing anytime!,1
My app keeps crashing. For no reason. I have it open for less than a few seconds and it crashes Edit 09/12/22: Can't edit posts after they have already been made. Can't tag anyone on posts that have already been made. AL pictures in a single post have to be in the same format. Garbage app 4 years later.,1
"I mean what's wrong with Instagram? Soo many bugs? I can't see the reel option, neither can i reply/ react to chats , what is wrong? Please tell me , i use Instagram most of the day and if this is happening it is really disappointing",1
"For a couple months now IG seems to fail each time the app is opened. I shut stories so it takes a moment for the app to mute them out but when that has been completed the newest post(s) will either go away to the point of ""view older posts"" or attempting to read ""more"" it moves to the view older posts message. Is this because I don't partake in their precanned options and because I close every ""sponsored"" or ""suggested"" input into my feed from their end? Just like FB, another fubarred snafu!",1
"These past few days Instagram isn't working properly like it used to be. Though my internet connection is stable but, it keep saying ""Couldn't refresh feed"". I didn't mind it at first cause I thought that maybe the application is updating but hello?! it's been days and there's still no update about what is going on. It's really poor, I couldn't even post anything because the refreshing of the app is quite lag.",1
"Instagram, you suck. I got a new phone, new carrier, same number. I get codes from other apps. Like an idiot, I didn't turn off 2 step authorization first. You are not sending me the texts and the codes via email are not working, if I can get one. I am locked out and can't log in several weeks now. Logging in Insta with FB option is useless for same reason.",1
I am not able to get the latest facilities even after updating the app and I am also not able to reply to a particular text in chats or even to react on chats These problems are not fixed even after reporting several times Even after reporting there is no response from Instagram Annoyed by this thing pathetic service from Instagram Kindly fix my problem as soon as possible and kindly respond to this Still haven't received any response,1
One sure can see reels... Juat that it is surprising that META is not able to take care of the bugs. Editing is a nightmare. Put text in one manner and comes out in another. Uploading is another issue. One can have the best net connection and yet..sometimes uploading takes ages. A lot of work needs to be put in to make it bug free.,1
App functionalities not good at recent times. I can't see Notes features no more available. It's been a month with no new App updates to fix the issues. Please confirm whether these issues can be resolved?,1
"The android experience compared to iphone is just sad, and it's declined over time since fb purchased them. Filters missing and no longer downloadable, no longer able to post both portrait and landscape photos together, why would you remove functionality that was working? Updates with no developer note is just lazy, it's one sentence. It's super disappointing, I never post anymore and used to love it.",1
When clicked on following in post. I still could see suggested posts. Whats the point. There is no turn off feature for notes it keeps popping up in videos. Why do i want to see stranger pop up in videos. It should stay in comments like any other comments.,1
I want to reset the password.. I have explored all the options but there is no way I can reset the password .. every password reset option sends the link to registered phone number which directly logs in me in to instragram without giving a choice to reset it... I need the password to temporarily disable the account but there is no way I can do that without the password .. no wonder there are so many dead accounts on this platform as people can't disable or delete it,1
"You guys let Facebook handle when someone gets hacked, and when you guys have proof of that hacked account you guys still won't help. As a Freelance Photographer that had the app when it first started, it's really messed up that my account got hacked 11-19-21 and you guys still won't help. All I got several times was an auto bot response from FB team that my account was disabled due to a violation I never even caused and was caused by a hacker. You guys need real people willing to actually help.",1
Brilliant app! But when I am tagging a reel while chatting only the messege is appearing...fix it fast..it's very irritating,1
Waste app because I manage 8 accounts in one Instagram but only one account get all updated features infact in some account high quality video upload and message reaction is not available Report but works. Nothing,1
"So recently I'm facing a problem idk how and where it went wrong. Suddenly whenever I'm tapping on Instagram it's showing a blank page even the login in page is not showing either. I tried everything like clearing my data and rebooting, nothing is happening. Then I decided to download the older version but the reels option is unavailable. So basically, I also reported my problem 100 times but the issue is not taken and. It's a good app, no doubt but the blank screen now sucks. Please resolve it.",1
It's been 24 hours since the suspension bug and I still haven't gotten my account back. Be serious! I haven't even posted since 2019 and I only use the app for posting stories and getting updates from K-pop idols. Give it back to me!,1
"Terrible performance and Galaxy S22, causes the whole UI to grind to a halt and can crash the phone. Only application on my device that does this.",1
"I am not able to get message update, reply option, emoji reaction, and many more.. i have complaint many time about update messaging, have not got any update. And i am not able to get update messaging in settings then search also.. this is very disgusting. Please fix this issue... üò§üò§üò§üò°üò°üò°",1
"I'm an artist so this is pretty much entirely my only option for getting my awful static images out onto the internet, oh if only they had motion and were monitizable. It's the only thing I use and its awful, it's literally the photo app and you get exponentially more views making videos. Just stuff post reels if you want to live because that's the only way we're going to push content, if you want us to do that to a static image üòÇ you'll have to pay us real currency!",1
"No because I have no access to Instagram because of sum dumb bug üíÄ. Like I was trying to log into another account and the screen just turned all white. I went back and couldn't add anymore new accounts because of the bug. So I uninstalled the app to try and make it work. I reinstalled it and when I opened it, I just got a white screen and nothing. I've reinstalled. Force stopped. Restarted phone but nothing works.",1
Suddenly my all chats are Removed and i am unable to send or receive any message from anyone and i tried a lot of things like reboat your phone and delete and redowload insta but still I am unable to msg anyone and also my all chats are missing,1
"Terrible experience for uploading albums. Cannot upload multiple photos from a Google photos album, poor selection experience, drafts get deleted or corrupted, albums upload 10 of the same photo instead of the selected ones. On top of that Instagram note thinks it's tiktok and is removing the one reason we all use it. Sort it out or go bust.",1
"Whenever i open this app, the screen would just appear to be blank, i waited long enough because i thought its my internet connection but, i tried to uninstall and reinstall it but it appears to be the same. Lastly i tried opening it in chrome, guess what? It works perfectly fine. Wth is wrong with Instagram this time? Pls fix this asap. Its really annoying atp.",1
"Suddenly cannot upload any of my photos to the app to post. I can only see and access photos I have previously posted to Instagram and not what is on my phone. And yes, I do have permissions set so it's obviously the most recent update. I'm so sick of the Facebook bs with this app. I can't run business like this.",1
"Hey Instagram, please please introduce a feature so that I can use another song on my reels when the original one (audio) becomes unavailable. Not at all satisfied with the feature that is audio becomes unavailable üò§ and I can't even use the other one while editing. Hoping a better experience please please introduce editing the old song with the new one in reels üôè",1
"Instead and improvising and fixing current features and then adding new ones, Instagram is just keeping on adding new and (some) annoying things and not thinking about making the app smoother and enjoyable for the users. Bugs after bugs, crashes after crashes, then there is a new update and I'm like, ""oh finally bugs are gonna be fixed!"" But nah, homie wants to add useless ""notes"" instead of fixing current problems. There is a process of growing, I think Instagram team needs to re-learn that.",1
"This app literally gets updated for the sole purpose of NOT WORKING. Everything is black and won't load. I can't send messages, post, anything. Instagram makes bank on this garbage app, AT LEAST make it work. Don't tell me to clear the data or the cache, or reinstall, I did all those things. As soon as you re-open instagram it's broken again.",1
"bugs! can't add to highlights! for some reason on only 1 of my accounts I can't add to highlight I posted a story on both my accounts & only showed up in one of my archives. Iv tried turning the save option in settings on & off, airplane mode, wifi, resetting my phone, exiting the app & coming back. AND NOTHING IS WORKING.",1
"Doesn't work anymore. I wanted to log in with a different account, it wouldn't let me. I uninstalled and reinstalled after that, and now it doesn't work at all. Just a blank screen. I tried restarting my phone but nothing works. This is very annoying for me since I use insta for my bussiness. I hope insta fixes this soon.",1
"App is not working!!!!! I have no idea what the recent update was but I have had to Uninstall and reinstall 3 or more times already. I have an Andriod and I have never had any issues. My feed won't update, slow to load, I cannot see my story post. It is AWFUL!!!!! After my reinstall 4, 5, and 6 this is getting ridiculous. It is not updating and if I do post it take forever to upload. Whatever update you did recently sucks!!!!!!!!!",1
I am unable to reply message by swiping. May I know the why this is happening? My insta is up to date updated.,1
"I have not been able to log into my account for so long, it's really really annoying me. Whenever I open the app, it's showing me a black screen. It's not showing me the login option, to be more precise. I've tried reinstalling it, rebooting my phone, clearing cache, everything. It still hasn't been resolved. Really, really bummed out.",1
App has constant bugs they upgrade the look rather than optimising its functions to work properly. Very frustrating for creators who have to start from scratch multiple times because of the various areas. If you don't get your act together they will jump ship when a new platform appears.,1
"My instagram hasn't been loading properly for almost an entire year. I've constantly been deleting and redownloading the app and it still won't load. I am now complaining about this because I'm sick of the app not working for me at all. Other people have been complaining about the problem. It's actually quite baffling that the problem never seems to go away. Instagram is an amazing app, but things like these would drive your users away. Please fix this.",1
"What has gone wrong with your recent update. Instagram is becoming a nightmare to use with bad user experience, since upgrading to the latest version, I can't spend up to 30seconds on my app without it quitting by itself. It's really poor, especially with me being a social media manager.",1
"I don't know what wrong with this app , but i faced black screen problem in last one month , when i opened my Instagram app it shows black screen , i uninstalled and reinstalled it but nothing happened. I reported the problem to fix the bug but nothing happened they can't fix the bug. Worst app ever . Their authority can't listen the user's problem",1
I can' t upload story more than 15 seconds.New update story time is extended to 1 min but I couldn't get the previous update of story time of 30 second.,1
After the update insta is not opening. When u try to open it simply just show a white blank screen or in dark mode it shows a plain black screen. It's absolutely fine on my friends phone. This should be fixes. Insta is used by more than a billion people and if we face these problems then it's not done. You should definitely check on it. It was sucj a good app,1
"Absolute headache trying to post things. Half the time it doesn't show photos and videos from my gallery, has been an issue for years.",1
"I still cannot use the 60 second story feature, even though it's been out for almost a month now. I waited for 1 month till now that it might be rolling out slowly to all users, but 1 month?? Everyone else is using that feature. I tried reinstalling instagram, signig up for beta to get that feature but nothing works. Very poor service.",1
"My Instagram app is not working at all from a while. Whenever i open the app it shows a blank white screen and no login details or nothing else. It is really too annoying. I have reinstalled the app many times, restarted my phone too but nothing is working. The app is working on other devices but i dont know why i am unable to use it on my phone. Do something instagram and remove this bug.",1
It is taking so ma y hours to upload a single reel. All my friends are also facing the same issue...!!!,1
"I just don't understand Instagram's algorithm, when I open reels I keep on getting ads reel and that too constant 4-5 reels after that I will 1-2 normal reel and then again ad reels it's too frustrating. The reels are not fun anymore because they're just ads nothing else. Before it used to be so fun I could use it all day. Now I don't like to use it at all.",1
"10/14/22 I was forcibly kicked from the app because it was ""updating"", despite not having auto-update turned on and not updating it manually. It's frustrating that apps are able to do this. 6/24/22 I purposefully don't update my app, and make sure every possible avenue for it to update on it's own is turned off. I woke up today and it updated itself.",1
There is an issue with the app I am certain should be fixed for the app improvement. The Instagram app is a full screen app why in the Instagram shorts there is so many writing on the screen of the app.? As a result of that the videos are hindered from view because of the many different writing on the screen. Can it be simplified with one command that can bring up all of the details to choose from then clear the screen again for a much better viewing. The details on the screen is to much.,1
"8/18- I havent been able to login for a few days due to it crashing. When I try to login it says ""Instagram has stopped"". I've tried everything I could think of to fix it and and nothing has worked. Very upsetting. Other than this I love the app. I just want to use it again. edit 12/14- still not able to access the app üò≠",1
Keeps freezing and closing when I make reels. I've reporter it but never get any attention for it and reels can also take up to three days with the status'posting' But the app's great sometimes. This is an edit. The issue still stands. Instagram please fix this issue!!!!,1
So many negative reviews! What happened to Instagram? I'm also experiencing problems it's worst!. 1) I'm not able to add stories it shows blur I can't do anything.. and when i upload that blur image it is upside down üîªüôÇüôÇ 2). Sometimes I'm not able to post on feed too.. the screen goes black n it freezes my phone... 3. My feed can't be refreshed now.. Very bad experiencesüëéüëéüëé.. i would have given 0 stars!!!!,1
"I use this app all the time for social purposes and recently idk what happened but none of my accounts recieve any DM requests. It says you can't text unless I follow them first. And I've tried everything in my settings to change it but nothing is working. And on my public account, even though all my messages are turned on in settings, nobody can text me. It says that I don't allow any new message requests even though I have turned on the requests in the settings. This needs to be fixed.",1
"Ever since I updated the app 2 days ago it started glitching. The reel videos keep pausing and the dm send button dissapears. I have to get out and come back in to make it appear only to disappear again while I keep typing. Please fix this, it was working just fine before the updateüòë",1
"In my Instagram reel or story or post, if there is a song, then English songs come but Hindi songs do not come even after searching, why is this happening.",1
"I legit can't even open the app. It logged me out for some reason a couple weeks ago, and ever since then, it won't let me sign back in. I open the app, and once its passed the main logo, it just goes to a black screen. No option to log in or sign up. I've deleted and re-download it multiple times now. Nothing helps/works. Legit can't even use this app anymore.",1
"Trying to keep in touch with all my photography friends is now almost impossible. I have to scroll last far too many auto playing videos, sponsored users and adverts that I end up giving up. Thought I had found a solution, just add all my friends as favourites and view their uploads that way, but oh no, Instagram has a limit on the number of favs you can haveü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. If you want a tik tok style app why not simply create one, instavid ü§î",1
"**UPDATE: Managed to download the app from Galaxy store instead which worked, but then it updated from Playstore and same issue again. ** Haven't been able to get into my app for days! Restarted phone, uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared cache, cleared data, everything. I've watched so many videos on things to try. No luck. Tried emailing developer through this page. No response yet.",1
"When I try to record a reel - comprising of a camera video+voiceover+reels audio, it plays fine at preview but after publishing it, it plays a scratchy distorting audio. This occurs with text to speech as well as regular voiceovers This peculiar bug is occurring since 18 Sept. Before that All reels published in this page have been created with no issues. Reels is clunky to create from the reels maker in the insta app. Pls help fix it fast.",1
I want to unsend all my messages in a comfortable and quick way. Deleting a single message is time consuming. Please Do something with that.,1
"I am updating the app, the updates don't install. It bugs a lot when I send voice messages, most of the time it apparently ""can't refresh feed"" and the calls I make are extremely laggy. It is not my wifi's fault, I have a very good connection and also please respond when people are complaining. Boomerangs are glitching super hard. ""music is not available in my region"", STILL, features like themes and replying to chats are unavailable and zucc is getting incredibly invasive with these surveys",1
I'm facing a bug I'm sorting my following list to latest but do not sort and display default list i am facing a lot of problems with instagram so please fix the all problems of my account and app,1
"This app is really good but it disappointed me while texting with friends. This app doesn't give me access to reply( replying to specific message sent by friends) message in inbox text, I can only send messages. Also I can't change themes but my all friends can use these both features even some of them doesn't have new updated version of this app ( I have fully updated and newest version of this app). This app is really too bad to text/chat with friends. Hope support staffs will fix this soon.",1
"Since Friday, there's something really wrong with this app which is so irritating. I have been using this app for some years now, but never faced this issue. Since past 2 days whenever I open the app, I can see nothing but a white screen. Instagram lite is working pretty fine though. Also everyone I'm asking is saying that they aren't facing this issue. I really hope this gets resolved immediately!!!!!",1
I am giving only one star because i cannot see invite collaborator option in my account . I send report many times but it doesn't work. Help me team Instagram.,1
"I would like to bring into your notice that, from today morning I m unable to login to my Instagram account. It's showing ""error, not able to process your request"". Tried several times, even re-installed the app but it was of no use.  Kindly go through the issue and resolve it as soon as possible as it is causing a lot of inconvenience for me",1
"Recently when I got to upload a photo or multiple photos, it's only showing me photos that I've already uploaded to choose from. The rest of my phone gallery is no where to be found. So while I can go into my actual gallery and upload an individual photo that way, I'm unable to upload multiple photos in one post. Very frustrating. Please fix.",1
"The app is having a massive problem or bug in older smartphones. Whenever I am trying to upload a story, if it is in video format then the story won't just appear on other's phone and they will see a green coloured screen. Kindly fix this problem as soon as possible. It's frustrating as hell.",1
"I can not log in into more than one account. Whenever I click add new account a black screen appears. I have this issue for weeks now. I have tried everything from udpating to reinstalling the app,clearing cache on my phone, rebooting my phone. Literally everything. I hope this issue gets fixed soon.",1
"As of 08/12 this app is not functional. Upon opening the app, my home feed will appear. But seconds later, it crashes and returns to my phone's home screen. The issue still persists after restarting my phone and even after uninstalling and reinstalling the application.",1
"* UPDATE* 08/07/2022 Still not working. App will not open up. I've tried Uninstalling it and reinstalling it multiple times. Awful! I have not been able to open app for the last 2 days. I've tried Uninstalling it and re-installing it, I've tired clearing the cahe..cache... nothing is working. Just a white screen when I go to open it. For reference I have a Samsung galaxy S10.",1
The app is not responding at all. I tried re installing it. Rebooted my Device but nothing worked. I request Meta to fix this is ASAP.,1
"There isn't a day without problem on this app. ƒ∞ think there is no kind of problem that ƒ∞ haven't experienced. It is by far the worst app I have used, it censores what it wants to censore, islamophobic, shows you random posts on feed from accounts that you don't even follow, way to many adds. Terrible experience, I just don't know how It became so popular. Makers can be ashamed of themselves.",1
"CAN'T POST REELS!! I love Insta and it has been very helpful in growing my small business. However i have not been able to post reels in quite some time from my business account. Either the reel button is not there OR after force stopping app it lets me create and edit reel, but WILL NOT post; it keeps giving ""please check connection and try again later"". I know for fact there is nothing wrong with my internet connect because i have tried to post the same content from multiple different networks",1
"Like others are saying, something changed recently and I can't post multiple photos. I have 4 photos that I wanted posted together and the app won't allow me to. I should be able to access the albums on my phone and select more than one at a time. Whatever changed, change it back, please!",1
"Recent update literally ruined the whole experience. There are minor stutter and lag can easily be noticed while opening story section. Can't upload the story despite several attempts. A blank white screen with icon is shown up after opening the apk from the recent page. ""Couldn't refresh the feed"" is appearing on the screen despite good internet connectivity.",1
"What's wrong with developer i didn't recognise, why most of the people's are facing problems while uploading story... It's not a first time I facing this issue it's more than a month I faced....i hope this review will help to developer to fix this bugs....",1
Faulty app. Uninstaller to see if it would fix the glitches I was having regarding my stories and video messages. Re installed the app but now all I get is a black screen where it should be giving me log in options. I tried connecting to wifi. Restarting my app. Airplane mode. Nothing works. Now I can't message anyone. Instagram was my primary form of contact but now it seems inoperable. Thanks a lot Instagram. Please fix yourself.,1
What the hell is this app...i am searching some user names and i am not able to find them. They haven't blocked me or deleted their account..and i am putting the right username...but still not able to find those accounts... please fix this glitch,1
"The truth is that the application has many problems, since I haven't been able to access the instagram app for almost a month, since the screen stays white and it definitely doesn't load... I had to clone the app with parallel space and that's the only way I could , but obviously it's not the same... I hope instagram fixes this once and for all, I'm not the only one with this problem.",1
"Never had an issue UNTIL TODAY The app kept crashing as I was trying to make a reel. I Uninstalled and Reinstalled several times and the reel features is not available...Poof Gone! Also, I find that I get a ton of people making duplicate pages following me. As soon as I like someone's page a duplicate of that page is being created.",1
"For the past couple of days I've been unable to check my activity; Instagram will freeze and/or crash completely whenever I try. I can go on my business account and check the activity there, but I can't on the main account I use. I've tried checking the settings, updating the app, clearing the cache and uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Maybe once you (the developers) actually fix this bug, and all the other bugs being actively complained about, I'll change my review; bc rn, Insta sucks.",1
"Cannot make a reel because everytime I search for music the app crashes. Absolutely the worst. None of the filters work. How am I to try out the lenses when all it keeps saying is network error. I'm scrolling through Instagram watching videos and refreshing and everything is loading, so obviously there's no network error on my end. Smh..",1
"It's just frustrating, I get an error when I try to post something on my Instagram page since I updated it (19th December 2022). l get tired of Instagram, too buggy. If I could gave no stars, I would do that",1
"The story's are all jacked up- it keeps turning off my audio, not letting me choose fonts or colors as the buttons are hidden behind my keyboard. If I try and choose a pfp that isn't recently taken it never loads and gets stuck on the loading screen forever. I don't know what's happened but ig has become so buggy its horrible.",1
"Notifications are not correct, comments disappear on app but not on computer. Randomly shuts down app when scrolling. App has updated multiple times but nothing has fixed for me",1
"This app is great expect for one thing i can't reply to specific messages in dm's like i can talk and stuff but reply to one specific message is not available. And i asked google abt this abd they instructed me to go to settings and ""update messaging"" but since i live in Bangladesh i don't get that option. Pls fix this i have reported many times abt this problem but no solution came to me. It's really hard to use this app without using the direct reply option pls fix it as soon as you can",1
Nowadays this app is getting worse yesterday I get a notification from insta that I have been suspended from Instagram for doing some unusual activity but I didn't use insta much more than 10 mins daily. I had done all the things what they said to do but the account is still not opening. please do some solution and bring my ID back it's a humble request to Instagram team,1
"It sucks.....! I've sending mails to customer service that I cant install insta , but no reply? Like what are they doing...... Apps not working properly every time I open any link , dont know why but this becomes white , I mean, whats this????",1
"Crashes constantly, reels are being rotated sideways but my text isn't, every editor whether it's for a still image or a reel/story is slow and will lag so badly I have to force close the app or it will crash. The app is functional sure, but you could say the same thing about a flat tire. I work in QA in the game industry and I'm sure the testers for this app have bugged these issues, so why are the devs not fixing them? Update: months later and still crashing and lagging every time I use it!",1
"Been using insta for a couple years, decided to MANUALLY clear out my ""liked posts"" so I could better curate it. Got soft-banned from unliking for bot activity, despite not using any bots. No option presented to contact anyone. Ridiculous that you guys are forcing higher interaction and preventing people from altering their own liked post selection.",1
"Instagram has turned into a gruesome barrage of awful ""stories"" and irrelevant adverts. It has completely lost focus and is trying waaaay too hard to be a video platform. Now, with the latest update, the app won't even let me post multiple images from folders my device. This used to work fine but, today, nope.",1
"I have been using Instagram for past 2 years with no problems as such but for past 10days I just can't open it . The screen turns black, I have done everything in my power from Uninstalling and reinstalling it again and again, to clearing catche etc but the problem remains the same . Even after repeatedly raising this problem with Instagram I haven't received any response. I just hope that they solve this issue ASAP because not only me but few other are facing the same issue.",1
"Wow, insta lite is so much better than this app. Videos don't play, only audio does. Doesn't refresh fast. I have to shift to lite again I guess.",1
Home page is not refreshing and I can't see my conversations and pics and photos are loading please fix the problem as soon as possible or if it's a update problem solve it,1
"Since the update I can no longer post new or multiple photos to my feed. I'm only presented with photos in my gallery from over two months ago and if I go into other files for a photo I can post a new one but no multiples, only one at a time. This is really annoying on my personal page but a disaster for my professional business page. Absolutely gutted.",1
Latest posts no longer appear at top of page when app is opened. What a crock. I would like to be able to disable reels entirely.,1
"Hello Instagram My Instagram got blocked. I am not able to like any video and photo, not able to follow whom please solve my problem. My family and I have a very good day by using this Instagram app. We cannot live without it. It looks very nice. Please solve this problem of mine.üôèüèª",1
Very upset with the app the last 2 days I've barely been able to do my work for my business because the app hasn't been working properly .... that's why you guys got 1 star.... I can't Bring in money if I can't do my work because my dms posts and everything else aren't loading so thanks jnstagram for not having a contact us section too......,1
"It's too easy to delete or ""hide"" a post by mistake (I really have no idea what happened to it, it's just gone), and no way to get it back. Shouldn't there be a warning or confirmation? I worked really hard to set this up, and if you're going to screw me over like that, then I just won't do it anymore. (I checked archive and recently deleted, it's not there.)",1
"Get 3 posts in my main feed, one which is sponsored before it claims 'im all caught up'. So I will have to favourite every friend and account I actually want to see if I bother to still open insta at all. One feed, chronological, favourites higher up, stop messing with it please",1
Instagram has been having problems since yesterday. At first my explore page changed completely and it won't refresh no matter how many times I tried and now I can't log in my account. I restarted my phone and still nothing works. Please fix your problems,1
I don't know I can't get through to support instagram and Facebook I sent 4 reporting problems with my account no reply in 2 months also my support inbox has no history of the 4 reporting problems about my account in the inbox. Hmmmm Facebook help please contact me and instagram help support . üôè thank you I will know about playstore on this message to contact me.,1
"Can't seem to access the reply option like the one in Facebook messenged, on the chat. Initially I thought it was my phone but everyone I know who has a Samsung phone can reply to each individual message. Please fix this!",1
You show me 7 product ads in a row!! Every single one I click not interested on and you still want to show me hundreds of more ads while scrolling through reels. I do not care about ANY product you are promoting or selling. Stop spamming my feed. Instagram and Facebook are both such trash!,1
"The feed is horrible, when you pause to see your friends feed it refreshed and loads new content. Some of my close friends' posts never show up on my feed. Loads of ads",1
The delete single photo icon when we try to edit the posts and ultimately delete a photo from an entire series of 10 pics is not working. Wonder why it's even there.,1
I have followed too many people. So I'm trying to unfollow some people. But i think there is a bug that is preventing me from doing this. please fix this. It shows that i have unfollow them. But it won't count one the total one. Please fix this. Thanks.,1
"What happened to Instagram??? I never experienced this bug. Everytime I try to log in to my account it always show ""the username you entered doesn't appear to belong to an account"" Please fix this bug immediately!!",1
I have a Redmi 9C model and within the last few months the app has been crashing and creating posts has become ridiculously frustrating. When I go to edit a picture all of the pictures I have selected for the post get replaced by the edited picture. If I upload certain pictures it distorts them as well. After reading the recent reviews it seems like I am not alone and most Android users are encountering the same issues. It is so frustrating and needs to be fixed.,1
my direct reply feature suddenly went missing. I uninstalled amd reinstalled the app and still the reply feature isn't available. I reported tge problem twice and still no action. Instagram please fix this,1
"@instagram, please look into the matters of bug and glitches. I can't even watch reels since 10 days. I've uninstalled and re installed it infinity times. Do something.",1
Instagram is literally just nud!ty. And reports do NOTHING. There's so many accounts advertising girls with see through underwear or full nud!ity loosely covered up with a hand,1
"I have been using this app for three years now, and I've often faced minor glitches which are fixable. But from the past 9 days, whenever I try opening the app I'm welcomed with a blank white screen instead of the login page. I've tried everything: switching off my device, rebooting my device, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, clearing the cache, etc. And the issue remains unresolved. I hope Instagram team does to something to fix this ASAP. I'm really dissapointed in Instagram this time.",1
Instagram was used to be very good app but now literally telling it's not working yess not working I don't know what is your problem search bar is not showing feeds just black boxes same as stories section refreshing refreshing it's gets refreshing üò≠ It's not my I'd issue or my phone j Heard some other people also facing same in there review section and in my city also Resolve this you are part of very big organization know that üò≠üò≠,1
From last week the Instagram was working well but from last 4 days the server has down so i can't open reels page and no refreshing. So fix the problem soon,1
When I start Instagram app and watching a video within 5 to 10 seconds automatically go back home screen.. am already uninstall and reboot the cell everything but the problem not cleared plz resolve the problem. It working fully slow and no refresh.,1
"Sound option is really worst wen v make and save reels it always shows ""you can still save ur videos but the music will b removed"" it's really a worst thing ever den wat is d use of making videos plz improve d sound options",1
"Everything is broken, at least for those with a Galaxy Fold 2. Members won't load in group chats, can't remove or add anyone even while I'm an admin, constantly crashing, fluctuating follow count glitches.",1
I had to give it a one star for the following reason. My daughter's account was hacked almost one month ago. The individual has tried to contact her for money to get it back. We've had no luck getting it back through the process on the insta help page.,1
I've got a new issue. Instagram won't let me block people when I've only blocked 2 accounts ever. I get a message saying I abused the blocking feature but I've done absolutely nothing for like months. Same with other features of the app.,1
"Not able to load reels ,i thought m having issues with internet but for other apps it's working fine.I am facing this issue frm last 4 days. I uninstalled and installed it again so it worked for few minutes and after sometime again its started showing loading everything is loading not able to see even profile pic of my followers.",1
"Customer support is never available. If you get hacked, you're on your own. No one responds or helps with any kind of fraud or issue of that sort. Tik tok is better!",1
"What Happened? Full picture library doesn't show anymore, only pics I've already posted... what's the point. Found a way to get to my full library but, can't upload more than one pic at a time. What happened to the full library view and multiple photo posting options? What's the point of the App you can't do the basics anymore? Disappointing and frustrating üëé",1
"Got a new phone, impossible to log in. Constant error messages. ""Customer service"" that just leads back to unhelpful pages. Accessing it is a nightmare.",1
"My account got suspended and I'm sure that I didn't do anything that could be the reason of getting a suspension. I deleted this app and downloaded it again, I tried to log in into my ""suspended"" account and it still doesn't work. The same thing is happening to my friend, I want to know why this is happening. :(",1
"It's really not good I downloaded this app 3 times and everytime after few days it shows ""message,app,fail And I have to reinstall it after every few days and make a new account and it doesn't even works with login or somthing so I just cant find solution for this",1
Everyone is reporting the same bugs but absolutely no reply about the issue. I rely on regular posting for my business and this is making it unusable until its fixed,1
Random scam accounts sending texts on my private phone number which I had to upload on instagram. This is supposed to be private and now I want to delete my number from my account and Instagram won't allow me. Not trustworthy Not cool üëé,1
"Rediculously buggy for a major social network app. Drafts often don't appear, requiring you to close and re-open the app. After about a day the draft can no longer load images, rendering the feature completely useless. Alt text fields won't save the alt-text after entering it. Banner notifications often appear blank.",1
"Why can't I turn off sound on the videos at the top of the feed? I used to be able to and now I can't. Touching the screen just moves forward or backward instead of muting or unmuting. (Also, using the word ""mute"" to mean something different than turning sound on or off is confusing.)",1
"I'm having a new phone and when I was logging in to my account it says my account is unfound , I tried to log in with other devices ut it didn't work so I think the problem is from Instagram itself besides it was ther some problems before like no voices was sending some glitches and logging me out I hope they fix these things",1
Cant confirm my phone number if your system doesnt send me a code. So whatever update yall did has made this app unusable. Ive even uninstalled and reinstalled. Guess i wont be using this anymore. Now all i get is a white or black screen of death. Id show you but theres no way to post pictures on here.,1
"I am being asked to boost a post on half the screen every time I open my page. Also, I am regularly shown content by people I have blocked. I don't know if this is cache issue, but it's traumatizing.",1
"When I'm trying to share reels on stories there lot of glitches, and unable to save any reel or post from my story...it wasn't like this before the update.... after every each updates the app is becoming either slow, or full of bugs",1
"I use two-step verification then insta give me 8-digit security code. Now i forgot my password . and i try to use these 8-digit security code. But every time it gives me error ""check your security code and try again"" . please resolve this issue. I want to recover my ID but these code dose not working.",1
"Ads of corrupted companies. I press ""don't show ads like this"" yet it shows the same one/s. Also when opening the app, it automatically refreshes your feed once. Stop that.",1
"Instagram used to be usable. Now, it is so unbelievably flawed that I've thought about never opening it again. There are so many ads. After every post, there is almost always an ad. Whenever you tag someone in a post, it sends the post as a DM to them. This angers me as an artist, as it makes me feel a bit like I'm annoying them. I can get past the ads, but I cannot get past the way tagging an account in a post works. It was not like this long ago. I hate Instagram for how nigh unusable it is.",1
"After the update, it was showing to verify my id until then it was not shown to other people. I started doing verification and at the last step it got hanged, the only option coming was to log and after logging out, I was not able to sign in my id and then I was not able to recover it and got lost forever.....",1
"I have been experiencing this for more than a month and it's really getting on my nerve. When I try to open the app, it doesn't show up anything but a black screen, I tried to turn off, restart my phone, and uninstall the app but still it wouldn't go back to normal. I thought there was just a tiny problem with the app in that moment but then it really won't let me enter the app, and I've seen many people here experiencing the same thing, so please fix this problem.",1
Worst app ever seen always crashes and not even feed is updating and unable to see chats... Degrading performance. Slowly PPL will leave it like Facebook. No improvement,1
I've submitted a issue and no return acknowledgement. Been waiting for almost 3 weeks. I was able to do a collab in the start and suddenly my collab option dissappeared. Waiting for Instagram support team to reach out to me but no one has reached out to me yet.,1
"Too many bugs in recent update! 1)Video calling on insta unplug earphones automatically. And whatever I'm trying, it didn't worked!! This is happening since I've taken recent updates! 2)Password field text shouldn't be read by your keyboard but it's reading! 3)Getting down again and again! 4)Automatically unsend the messages. 5)Songs that added to the single photo in post is get started from the very start sometimes than actual selected part! Instagram! You need to test your updates properly!!",1
The quality dramatically changes after upload. This is suppose to be a photo/video app? What's the use if the quality is compromised?,1
Worst app ..Reels and other vedio are not played properly need work on it .. bad experience on this app because of vedios and reels are not work properly or played fully ...,1
3 of my friends' accounts got hacked in last 6 months. This is alarming. Other than that the app is fine.,1
"Worst reels edit... Reels edit doesn't work properly each ande very reel has to be deleted and posted for 3-4 times as the edits are not working. Sometimes, songs are not getting added, and few other times, video turns upside down. Worst Instagram editing options. Is it your tactics to post the reel 5-6times again and again so that you can charge the internet data???",1
App is sluggish even on newer devices. Keeps waking phone up and eating battery lately. Suggestions are way off and Instagram official channel/notifications are pure annoyance.,1
I don't know what happened with my account I am unable to refresh the feed and chats even unable to load the previous chats etc. Whereas in the Instagram lite it's working,1
"The app glitches alot. Especially on video calls. One minute your camera doesn't work or your audio, it also randomly hangs up if you switch apps.",1
It's been crashing a lot lately and not working properly. I can't post a reel even though i have perfectly fine internet connection. I was having this issue since last month but still nothing happened. I really like this app but it has major downsides. Please fix the bugs. I'll change my rating if you do so.,1
"So, this never used to happen to me using Instagram but I cannot load any of my recent photos when I go to post them. This only happens on Instagram. All other social media apps are loading my pictures except this one. I went through my phone and did all the things you normally would do to fix this (restart phone, check settings, made sure the app was updated, etc) if the problem was on my end, it would have been fixed by now. Hopefully you guys see this and fix the issue with the app. Thanks.",1
My app updated a couple days back. The new interface is NOT AN INPROVEMENT!!!!! NOT USERFRIENDLY!!!! CANNOT SEE OR CHAT WITH ANY OF MY CONTACTS ANYMORE!!!!!!. already un may you had provided an update with pathetic features you removed within days. Stop making changes without testing the features!!!!!!!,1
"Instagram use to be for like minded photographers, or people who just wanted to share their experiences through photographs. Instagram has lost its way, chasing the money rather than what the users want. Use to be my go to platform, now its the worst out of the lot. Absolutely no interaction with people I follow. Save yourself the time and download Vero True Social instead.",1
"The app has always worked well until the last update. I can see comments that I and others post but all replies to the comments are hidden unless I go into my notifications and click one reply at a time and when I do, only that specific reply becomes visible.",1
Getting suggestions notifications even tho I have them turned off. The only notifications I have turned on is for messages. One of my biggest pet peeves with an app is when they have unnecessary notifications. If these do not stop soon I will be deleting both my personal and art accounts.,1
"I am putting one star because the app is in dark mode and the letters are white and then there is this weird bug? Happens that the app turn everything white and also the text so I can't see nobody's text not even mine so if you want a better review is as easy to fix the issue, thank you I would much appreciate it.",1
"I've been trying to create an instagram account since yesterday. But it always said ""sorry we couldn't complete your request"" or ""please wait a few minutes before you try again"" over and over. So maybe it can't accomodate any more new users or what? What a waste of time.",1
"App blackscreens and I can't reach support for help. App literally turns into a black screen when I try to log into accounts. I've restarted my phone 3 times, reinstalled the app but that only lead to me getting logged out of ALL my accounts. Now all I have is a black screen when I launch the app. The customer service only offers help with account troubleshooting in terms of login, and I can't get in touch with any support at all. (Trying to open instagram from browser just redirects me)",1
The app is very bad right now because of the like and follow restrictions in which it usually logging me out and letting me always changing password pls your app seriously needs an update,1
"Honestly, what is the point of a Reels draft folder if more than half of the time the drafts are going to just not open or let you post them or even let you go back and edit them. Instagram keeps trying to force videos over photos in order to compete with that other app... But they do not make it easy for creators to create content within the app.",1
"I don't just like what Instagram is updating all the time and Instagram keep on getting worse , Instagram was once my best application ever but now everything suddenly change ,I can't even follow anymore,I doesn't allow me to follow the person I want to follow it has happened to my old Instagram I opened now I opened another one and is still the same thing please try and fix Instagram and stop upgrading rubbish for us please try as much as possible to fix Instagram, I want to follow my friend",1
"I had this app and nothing shows up anymore the stories and posts don't refresh, I tried deleting the app and redownloading it and now the app doesn't even load up, this is happening with or without wifi or data, seems like a Facebook serverdide issue please fix this asap",1
It was fun in the start but it isn't keeping up with the latest updates.I have reported it multiple times even did it with a different account.They just won't fix it . If my friends weren't on insta i would have quit long ago. So disappointed Instagram.... check your management team and do something,1
I am giving you 1 star because you are not fixing the bug of DM messenging feature.So many people didn't get the new messenging feature after updating the app to latest version.We still the old one messenging feature.I reported the problem in Instagram app but nothing happen.So please fix this issue as soon as possible so people will give you 5 star rating.,1
It's been around more than a month that I've been installing and uninstalling the app over and over. It stopped working all of a sudden and won't open or won't load. I tried every possible way to make it start. Couldn't figure out the problem. Regret having created an account here. Instagram lite version is working but is not as satisfying as the original version.. hope the problem will be fixed.,1
Somethings is significantly wrong i have been battling with you all for quite some time and ots the worst ever at this point i use multiple phones and like to be logged in on each phone i can no longer do that and even when not logged in on numerous phones im still logged out and keep being forced to change my password and confirm my identity its not making any sense please update this,1
I like how the app dedicated to picture sharing is literally the worst app for picture sharing. There's a 10 photo per post limit and you can't even caption individual pictures per post.,1

I use it because I have to but I would stop if there were another options. The management is horrible and it's so buggy. The only good part is the things some people post but that hardly has anything to do with the app itself.,1
I used to love it... Now it is glitchy when I put text on my reels and of course we all know that only a small amount of our friends can even see our stuff. It used to be fun and now it feels like a job.,1
Was hacked I dont like social media anymore it's driving me insane I've turned very violent over the world's opinions towards my media I've gained alot of views and likes but I learned to let it go I've reached my highest point of craziness and it's only getting worse maybe if things change I'll return but I highly doubt that.,1
Instagram worked for all these days but suddenly these advertisements pop up while on the app. Can't see any videos or record voice messages. Right now very disappointed with these advertisements.,1
If I wanted another tiktok app I would just use tiktok. Why make reels your top priority when instagram has ALWAYS been pictures? Why fix whats not broken? Sick of all the videos,1
Keeps glitching I'm so sick of Instagram blurring my stories and Instagram music not being available! Also the notifications are always delayed and they even come after ive already checked the message. Fix it!,1
"Very bad, It's more difficult to sin in. It always said to sin in through Facebook that I don't like. One of the worst app I ever seen on Play Store. Too many irrelevant ad are displayed among which most of are fake and may hack your account if you click on that ad. Very bad",1

I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app as well as restarted my phone many times. I only use the app on my phone, so it's extremely frustrating. I see where others are having similar issues recently. I wish Meta cared enough about their users to fix the problem.",1
"I wouldnt even put a star if it was possible The app is over run with ""meme"" pages posting straight up porn and instagram does nothing about it.

Bad reel experience: music unavailable, gone music on late posts, videos cannot be edited, even when it has been edited it failed to save. Video got flipped, music has static sounds... Just lots of frustrating bugs ...",1

There is no customer service. There is an issue logging in using pixel 7 pro and they don`t care on resolving the issue. There is no such issue with iOS.,1

I don't know why Instagram has disabled my account for no reason. I haven't violated any Instagram guidelines. But now iam not able to log in to my Instagram account.

"What is the purpose of ""notes"" when we can post what we are thinking in a story, on our timeline or in a reel? Literally serves no purpose and is now another, ugly looking and useless thing on the app.",1
Most stupid interface When we upload a photo it gives option to edit each in different ratio...but then puts the final post in same ratio....app designed by 2 year olds,1
"I don't see the notes option in my instagram , i even tried updating the app , clearing the cache . But still no change , notes option is still missing !",1

"I lost my number and try to remove two factor authentication from account by reaching out the support team for almost 2 month. No response yet, the worst app in terms of help and support to users.",1
My story archive stopped working. No action was taken after multiple reports. So disappointing. IG only takes action when there is a worldwide issue.,1
Can only see the one reply in a massive thread on any comments of mine by tapping on them in the notifications. Years of Instagram and they break the most basic things over and over again.,1
Absolute garbage and continuing to go downhill. Full of bugs and rough user experience. FAR TOO MANY ADS.,1

dont use intagram they randomly and permanently deactivate your account for no reason .... then refuse to respond to you when you request a reason why and if you try to create a new account that is anything like the old account they istantly deactivate that one if i could give lower than 1 star i would,1
They need to make it more accessible to login to your account from the desktop if you lose or upgrade your mobile phone. This way you can get into your account without issues.,1

Since last week all I coukd see is post from Oct 20 to Oct 27. No new feeds!!! Irritating. I uninstalled & reinstalled but nothing is working! Restarted my phone too.,1
Giving 1 star because of bugs and awful experiences After new update I am unable to react to message with emojis after many time reporting the I reinstalled the app and now a new bug I am unable to login my second I'd. Doesn't expect this from you guy ü•≤.,1
"Worst! For 4 weeks now app doesnt want to open, iv tried everything so clearly is not my phone. Now its been 4 days on ""uninstalling app"" stage. Its ridiculous.",1
Awful bugs My account got banned all of a sudden and I know I'm not the only one. The app gets worse with every update and it's full of bugs and glitches.,1
Previously I was able to see views of Facebook shared reels also on my IG reels. But really don't like this new update .don't have idea how many views I got on Facebook shared reels.,1
"How is it possible that i have this app installed on my phone and it won't let me update the messenger features, i tried requesting help on the app itself but no help ever came. Very disappointed...",1
"glitches, was posting argentina stories and note but can't change my note nor can i see my story now. clearly ruins best moments of life always not just football but it always happens!",1
"idk if it's just me or my music is always some old songs? everytime i search the artist ive been looking for it's not there? pls fix this ,i can't put some new songs in my story.",1
"HATE reels, HATE this 'music' krap they've started. Started to unfollow those who post reels onto my feed. Started to unfollow those who add 'music' to posts on my feed. Insta is going downhill fast. Every 3rd post is an advert. They've started this 'suggested post' krap again. Driving me nuts. Don't know how much longer I can stay.",1
Absolutely hate the amount of ads and the random posts from unknown accounts that pop up on the feed. It used to be soo neat at point.,1
Since last 2 days my Instagram didn't work properly. Couldn't refresh feed and I can't share any post and reels 8 uninstall twice but the problem is same.,1
"Why do i need to uninstall everytime to share reels ? After installing.. everything back to Normal after WITHIN 24HRS. Then it happen again.. from ""Add this Reels"" to ""Add this post"" when its a Reels not a post. Kept repeating this for 3rd day now.",1
"No functionality...is this supposed to be a beta app? Calls that are not forwarded,messages stuck for a day until delivered,feed that...""feeds"" whenever it wants to,etc...",1
The amount of hypocrisy in this app is just insane. They ban people for silly reasons and then goes on to promote and push out accounts filled with nudity and sexual content. Keeps appearing in my timeline although im not following. I am sick of blocking every account.,1
Sir please fix the bug problem of instagram because it is not opening properly and it is not running properly since its last update we are facing a lot of problem in watching anything and downloading story please fix it ......,1
"since the update i can't look at the stories at all, i click on stories and it automatically moves on to the next one and i can't even press on it like before to pause it either is this a glitch please fix it",1
The nudity on this app is insane- I dont follow the accounts and that along with Instagrams desperation with add companies really hinder your experience. Can't scroll for a minute without seeing sexual content? I expected better seriously. And when I do report and block it does nothing!,1
"its almost 2023 and i still only get 15 second stories, fully updated, there's not even an option to switch 60 seconds. what is wrong with you, instagram?",1
"One starüò•it used to work perfectly but lately,its slow and even can't add songs while uploading my storyüòíeven after updating,nothing changes",1
"This app was fine but when i try to type something on my post before i share my ig story it disappeared! Only went i tap on the pic it appeared again and for ig story, I CANT TAG ANYONE! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TAG IF I CANT DO IT?!?!? I will keep giving 1 star until this is fixed!!!",1
The app is just broken. 1st it says I'm too young to have an account after having it for 10 years. Then I created a new user and now it can't refresh my feed and wants me to log in as a different account.,1
I got conned for $1000.00 last year! It wouldn't have happened if Instagram took down the post of a friend's hacked account like she requested numerous times. Unfortunate for me I never recovered my very hard earned money,1
Why u deleted my account for without any reason.. without any reason you disable my account and when I try to open it there is only one message that we are working on your issue..but still I can't able to open my account.. please do asap..,1
"There's a bug in a new updated version, I can't able to access my saved highlights. #BugInstagram ..",1
"Just give me a chronological feed, lessen the ads and make an albums feature that i can link to my grid. I like sharing my life but yall make it hard to enjoy using this app",1
"This app has so many glitches, like sometimes the feed doesn't refresh the dms take time to load and I can't even login this is really frustrating plz do something about it!!!!",1
"Way too many adds. I see more ""suggested"" videos/posts and adds than my own friends. Seriously about to delete my account. Such a waste of time anymore",1
"Been trying to upload a one minute video since 10am and now it is 11.15 and still not uploading. Tried uninstallinh the app, turning my phone off and changing from the house WiFi to my 4g and still not working Defo deleting ü§¨",1
Terrible product. Constantly problems with posting my photography to share with clients. Tons of spam & fake accounts. I would have given it zero stars!,1
"What a stupid service by Instagram can't even add music to my post, and there is no option of sharing notes even though my app is updated..",1
"it keeps lagging on my xiaomi 11 lite 5G when i try to edit reels & shoot a video on my story. kindly fix, i will rate it 5 start if you do.",1
I'll have to redownload everytime i want to use the app since nothing would load on the app even though I've tried on other platforms and it works fine without issues it's only on Instagram that i experience the problem,1
Can't get the 2 step verification code. I've tried several times already it said the code was sent to my phone but I've never get any verification code!,1
Instagram really seems to enjoy making themselves irrelevant. Seems something happened overnight that doesn't allow me to paste in my hashtag block into the caption. Instead it wants me to describe the photo now.,1
"The app was very good but after the update it gets stuck and become so laggy that it doesn't update the feed, messages and even posts. Very bad experience ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨",1
"Quite possibly the worst app to send photos, considering it's your only job. Why can't I shrink a photo to fit the screen? How did someone get my account information to get my bank account. You're all terrible and negligent with your worthless jobs.",1
The app is not working on my phone Samsung galaxy M33. I brought this phone last 3 days back...first it worked kn 2nd day it said there's a bug....so I thought may be a universal issue but no....I Uninstalled and re installed a 50 time in 2 days....still same. I want this to flbe fixed very soon please....,1
"I don't know what's wrong with my Instagram account I mean I hardly post a selfie of mine in months and I am not even active my in ig account but when I opened my account today it was deactivated..... and when I tried to reactivate it by my number and gmail it is still processing and processing but my ig account hasn't been reactivated, I even mailed them but no response as usual...... I love instagram but when your ig account deactivates for a thing that you haven't done it really hurts a lot.",1
"As of late, the app is not working at all... saying I should verify my number but I'm not receiving the code...yes I checked the number it's correct, no it's not my network provider's sever because I am receiving messages from other people",1
"Worst. When you change your profile picture it takes 1,2 hours to load sometimes the loading sign doesn't goes away you need to uninstall and install again worst app",1
I report a problem and waited for few week no one responds all my other friend have note in the Instagram but I don't have I try all the way still can't all the tutorial update to latest version delete and download again,1
"This app gets more terrible every week. Despite following all of the advice of the ig execs, the things I post are still shadow banned, they don't even turn up in hashtag search results. I literally spend hours every day making videos and posts that get zero views. There is nothing to understand about algorithms, ig forces users to buy ads in order to be seen, even by your own followers. This app used to be good, about art & people, now it's just ads & commerce. Its soul crushing and depressing.",1
"The number of ads and sponsored posts on the app is atrocious. I understand you need to make money, Instagram, but I DO NOT want to see 3 ads and sponsored posts for every post or story that I actually want to see. There is no quality control on the ads being shown, and users have no way of opting out of seeing them. Only the powers that be know how user data is being harvested (read: stolen) and sold by Instagram and Meta. Absolute trash.üóë",1
"I was tryin to login. Got the OTP code from emal, then enter the OTP to this app. Not redirect to dashboard or something, its keep stay on the enter the OTP page",1
"Not able to open the app, occurs error on refreshing the feed. Not able to send messages",1
"So basically this review is just a copy and paste from my review same issues... Once again we are back with the same issues prior to my previous review. Not that I want to, I can not watch ANY REELS without them just freezing, it's becoming very annoying to use your app I have to switch my phone off and on. My experience with your app was alot more fun prior to your recent updates! How about instead of adding updates, maybe putting a bit more focus on fixing the issue/issues with your App!",1
In last 2-3 days my insta account is not working properly. speed of network is also enable but it can't refresh. Get the solution of this problem as soon as possible,1
"This application has been crashing on me the second I open it every day for the past NINE DAYS!!! This should be fixed by now. I've done everything I can to attempt to solve this on my own, nothing works. And there is no way to contact any sort of IT Support or Instagram directly. Apparently this crashing had been solved for iPhone users, but there is no solution for Android users. I am extremely upset. It's been well over a week now.",1
"Recently all of my reels videos backround music is very annoying sound, everytime I add reels. As soon as I add I have to delete because of sound. I tried all different ways but can't add music on my reels and can't post any live or reel with music! My professional account turned to left account because I can't post anything. It's been like that for 10 days! Please fix that problem. I see the other people's reels with no issue why I am having problem and can't post anything?",1
"Super buggy and nearly impossible to use. Anytime I attempt to post more than one video in a post I receive an error stating ""photo can't be posted"". This has been going on for nearly two months. If I could give less than one star I would. Considering uninstalling this app.",1
It's app is Good üëç But my Account have a problem. In my account's chat No reply option and no react emoji option so I gave only 1 ‚≠ê. plz Instagram owner and etc suggest that all options in my account it will be so kind of you üôèüôè Thanks .......,1
My instagram app is not working from last 20 days. I am able to use instagram on other devices but the app is completely not working on my device. Once open the app nothing appears except a blank screen. I have reinstalled the app several times still it's not working. I'm able to use instagram lite version but this application is not working at all. It is so irritating. Please solve this issue as soon as possible.,1
"I always am left with a white screen everytime i open the app, i thought the app would correct itself and load the app correctly, i was surely incorrect. I left my phone on for 4 -ish hours and there was no sign of text popping up from the white blank screen. This is just ridiculous, fix your app please. It has been too long without any fix of any kind. This stops new users from downloading your app üëé.",1
"It's very annoying In my Instagram account I do follow every rules hai and regulations, also never post and any harm content but it's showing your account is restricted from advertising.",1
I thinks this apps is great for us but it should improve its setting in restrictions mode there Is so much 18+ content. I request you to please confirm that one before posting any post.,1
My Instagram is so bad. The option to swipe and reply is not working. Reply immediately emoji option not working There is no facility to post a 60 minute story.,1
"Today only I installed Instagrame and created an account. At first it was alright but after using for 30 min, suddenly my feed disappeared. And uninstalled the app and then reinstalled it but in vain. Please fix this issue. Otherwise there is no value of having an account. Edit : After one day, my feed is not blank at least. But now it is flooded with random reels of people whom I don't follow. My friends post is not showing. I'm really fed up.",1
"This current Instagram is really bad. Always hanging, and won't process anything. I've downloaded, uninstalled and downloaded over and again, and nothing is working. I'm so tired.",1
"Getting to the point where I have more ads and posts from ppl I don't follow in my feed than what I actually want to look at. Plz revert. Also fix not being able to add 2+ vids in a post without crashing...Also am seeing the same posts in my feed over and over again, even if I've already seen it 2+ days ago, despite going through the entire feed at least twice a day. It's like a bug they leave in on purpose to make you spend more time in the app, when it makes me hate it that much more.",1
Can not react on messages. So many updates till but Instagram failed to fix this bug.,1
"I don't have option to add music that i want. Also, very popular music are missing. I have approached the costumer support but no response. Bad and poor app.",1
"It started with crashing this morning. Couldn't watch reels at all. I uninstalled and reinstalled thanks to a tip I seen online, but now wont let me log into my main account. Main credentials log me into my business account. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling again and cleared app data. Now won't log in at all. Edited to add that the login with facebook option doesnt work (says try again later), and help logging in doesnt work either.",1
"I am facing problems in reacting with emojis.I have reported it many times but there is no response from them, basically they don't hear your problems.",1
"Update sucks, can't view any videos. Instagram is just getting worse and worse. Update 2022: instagram deactivated my account for no reason, I have never done anything against community guidelines. I tried to follow the prompts in the app to request a review, and it wouldn't load. I tried logging out so I could log back in, but my account can't be found. The FAQ and help center is absolutely no help. The chat support is never open so I cant contact anyone directly. Instagram is a joke.",1
Soo slow and so glitchy nothing works or loads I thought it was my WiFI at first but no my messages won't load my pictures can't do anything on the app anymore!,1
"I have uninstalled Instagram twice because when I try to upload a reel, it freezes. Please fix this issue.",1
I can't post reels on story it's not being correct i request that it should be fixed as soon as I'm hating all this fix my insta why there is no collaboration options. Fix it as soon as possible,1
The app is literally full of bugs these days. Every other reel will load only 50% and will be stuck there forever. Getting fed up now.,1
"It seriously isn't working! It is just so freaking frustrating trying to create a IG story. Editing tools sucks, bugs issue. Can't select the fonts or change the colours of the fonts. Selection bar kept hidden behind the keypad and let's not go to the gif issue....why can't we mirror rotate the gif like in apple ios? Android's Instagram app really not working at all....",1
"For some days I am facing some problems on Instagram.Don't know why you have disabled my collaboration option due to which I am not able to collab my reels and my posts with other creators, Because of this the reach of my page has also decreased And the message section also gets stuck. Sometimes several months old messages start showing up now. If you have done this intentionally then please tell the reason if this is a bug then please fix it as soon as possible.",1
"For some reason my Instagram keeps showing YOU'RE ALL CAUGHT UP even though I haven't used it in weeks. Tried uninstalling, clearing browser data, cache data etc but it still doesn't work .",1
"It's happened many times but this is the longest it's gone. Instagram had logged me out my account(s) and leaves a black screen. I've restarted my phone, uninstalled and installed the app multiple times, and everything else I could think of to get it to work and it still hasn't changed.",1
"Reels work horrendously for my phone, the fonts and its alignment has the brain of its own. It rearranges itself at its own will.",1
This app is not working properly. I am unable react emoji in my chat and not found option for swipe up message for reply . And not see messanger update option.,1
"This is the worst experience I have ever experienced in this new updates,my followers don't count the app keeps hanging and showing a lot of ads it really sucks, you guys should work on this or lot of people will end up not using this app anymore I'm very disappointed in this app what a useless app",1
I'm recently having problems uploading my reels. Everytime I try to upload a video I get this static sound after I add the audio. I tried re-installing IG and re-started my phone but the issue is still there. I tried with few different videos and they are all like that. This issue is been 2 weeks already and IG is not fixing it üò°üò°,1
This app is great but the user interface for selecting images to post is just awful. Im forced to slowly scroll through hundreds of pictures in order to post the ones I want. For some reason I can't just post to my story from my photos app either. It's wonky and it could be way better,1
"Really disappointing. It won't let me live stream any more. At 1st I had my DJ console, and would be able to livestream with the music/audio coming straight from my DJ console into Instagram. Now it's not doing it anymore. It's just using the phone mic instead, and I haven't even done anything. Really disappointed.",1
I'm giving one Star becouse It often happens that my profile does not work And one day i lost my all draft videos how many times did i report but no response from Instagram side. I'm very dissatisfied üëéüëé,1
"Why the insta is not working properly, it stuck whenever I open the saved options and it's so embarassing, also pls add an option for vegitarian and non vegitarian people I see the things which I don't want to ...",1
Lots of Bugs while uploading stories and Not good Music library. Just recommending Tiktokers song which don't like everybody.,1
Not really user-friendly. Reels have proven difficult and they want access to everything.,1
"If as a user you are facing any technical issue, it's impossible to get it fixed no matter how many times you report it. The song icon gets stuck in the center of the story and won't float around like other icons. I am reporting this issue frequently from last 1 month but it's just going unnoticed.",1
"I don't have the option to allow story sharing on my account, really weird and frustrating how sometimes certain features just aren't there for me.",1
"My 2 accounts got hacked,and when my friends report that account,Instagram replied this account do nothing inappropriate to restricted,this is really thinkable situation for Instagram,and it has many bugs sometime it works like new launched apps",1
"Quite how this platform is as popular as it is baffles me. It's slow, unreliable and generally infuriating to use. Lightyears behind YouTube, Facebook and tiktok in terms of usability.",1
"Instagram is getting worse every day and this situation is really causing its audience to decrease every day... You can't post clips, you can't post stories, every day there is a new bug. One day Direct has a problem, one day it blocks. It's really going in the worst possible way.. Now we can't even connect it or make clips, it either blocks or doesn't show everything... I'm very dissatisfied with this program... every series is updated, it gets slower and worse, and the posts go away instead o",1
"After updation its just testing my patience ,horrible it is,the post which i dont want keeps popping up n everday i hv do nt interested yet again instagram shows it,over n above that the no. of times its LAGGING is HORRIBLE JUST HORRIBLE,unable to open any post.ITS JUST PATHETIC KINDLY MAKE SURE THAT AFTER UPDTN THERE IS NO BUGS N TOO POST WHEN I SAY NOT INTERESTED PLEASE YOULL DO NOT SHOW OR SUGGEST THE SAME AGAIN NOT EVEN SINGLE POST I WANT TO SEE when i say NT INTERESTED OR I JUST DONT LIKE",1
"Not able to play a single reel on insta and any video on FB, pls solve this issue asap,,it's so annoying",1
I cannot save pictures from dms anymore. When i want to download a picture from instagram a pop up appears that i need to allow storage permission and it is already allowed and i still cannot dowload any pictures from my dms,1
Used to be so good. It's absolutely terrible.... Nothing but adds and porn.... You flip through your feed nothing but advertisements or dildos pages for girls that send you to only fans... Terrible,1
"Deletes audio randomly, will crash if you edit too many pictures at once and will honestly just waste your time",1
"It is always buffering, not loading any content. Now i started hating it. If i cannot see any videos or photos, then i will use whatsapp only.",1
I don't know what's wrong with it but I'm unable to apply filters on my pre existing photos in the stories. The filters keeps on loading and goes on and on without a break. I've tried everything from uninstalling insta to clearing all the data but still every time I open the insta I'm stuck on the same problem and it's very annoying and pathetic it keeps on happening pls fix this issue ASAP,1
Can't unsend any message! The facility of 'unsend' has stopped working with my account. Really disappointed.,1
I have reported Instagram more than 10 times but they didn't responding. The icon of activities and messages are changed with each other and there is no all songs. I can't able to use all songs. There only few songs are there. Thre are no any song af allen Walker or no any Hindi song also. And INSTAGRAM IS The worst app I have seen. All phone have different features. In chrome it is running different. In lite it is running different. In my phone it is running different. .....,1
When i watch reels app automatically close.I have updated Instagram many times but they did not solved this. But other apps are working good,1
"I an absolutely FED UP with this app and it's absolutely CRUCIAL in building your business. YOU need to FIX the numerous glitches that YOUR app has. The reel templates GLITCH anytime you're in the middle of uploading your videos by not allowing you to place the video where you desire it to start and end. I've deleted the app, Uninstalled and reinstalled it. Does not change a single thing. GET IT THE F TOGTHER",1
"I've been plagued by bugs with this frustrating app. The main one I've tolerated was the fact that sometimes messages just will not send unless you exit the app. This is frustrating by itself, but now I can hardly open the app for thirty seconds before it crashes. Do better.",1
"GIVE US BACK OLD FORMAT!! I absolutely HATE!!!!! the new format!! All I used to get was art from the people I follow and the occasional cute animal photo! Now I get all sorts of toxic, gross or weird stuff that I did not ask for!!!! And it's all reals!! I just want the art that I used to get, but now I can't even find the art without fishing through all the other stuff that I don't want to see!! STOP TRYING TO BE TIC TOK! I got you to be Instagram. I do not recommend unless they change!",1
I have updated the app everytime however not getting new updates feature in the app. I have reinstalled this app many time. Please look into this.,1
"i have been using Instagram for several years now. It's an amazing app but from past few days it's not working properly. I tried reinstalling the app agin and agin but still the problem are same üòî. Whenever I put a story or write something on it, the app closes in the middle, this happens every time and its frustrating now. please fix the bug please fix this problem",1
"The page keeps loading and nothing is working, also reported several times. No action taken",1
Not recommended at allüëéüëéüëé It's just annoying. It's been almost a month whenever I try to open it just shows a blank screen no option of logging anything........I did all the possible things from clearing cache to reinstalling and even I rebooted my phone many times but the problem has not been solved yet It's just so disgusting to see there is no response from Instagram regarding this issue. Please solve this issue ASAP......,1
This is the most bug filled social media app that there is. Sometimes I have a post ready and it just crashes or simply refuses to post. Today my stories just pass by themselves. It is clear that you code your app exclusively for Apple phones and don't care about your Android user base. This favoritism just makes people get angrier and angrier with time. It's filled with ads and nonsense. I have to give it one star to post this but I wish I could give it zero.,1
Swipe reply option is not available on my Instagram account....i report that problem more that 10 Times but Instagram still not fix that that's the problem of Instagram team they not available for their customers,1
"Latest update broke the app to such extend thats it has started to annoy me. In dark mode sometimes some portions get inverted to light mode back again causing text to be unreadable. Have to force re-start. On clicking reels icon, first reel always launches with double audio which has to be fixed by moving to next reel and returning back. When you click on a song name in a reel, you see reels made by others with same audio but after few slide pressing on a specific reel opens 2-3+ spot reel",1
"Collaborating posts do not work, the option to collaborate a post is not available on my app. Takes forever to post one post even with good Wi-Fi or strong network connection",1
"Reels killed this app and it's community, especially people into art and photography. Actual posts just get no reach since they don't get pushed by the algorithm. Stop trying to be TikTok and fix your app that doesn't work properly for half of it's users, I'm missing features that everyone else seems to have, and I know I'm not the only one. If there was a better alternative I'd be long gone but I have no audience on any other platform and can't afford to start over.",1
"Used to love this app. But now more and more making it difficult to run a small business or keep up to date with content from friends. Also have my website on my business account blocked by Instagram with no explanation as to why it's censored just a generic generated message, it's hurting my business and not to mention engagement has absolutely plummeted for both pictures and reels. Honestly if it keeps going like this, I'm just waiting to jump onto something new.",1
"It has lots of bugs.When I try to create a reel it sticks,even after updating the app and clearing the cache again and again üò°üò°. And when I finally create the reel after a long time it doesn't upload Even after having data as per requirement. Please fix this problem as soon as you can.",1
"So you deleted my last review..perhaps try listening to what those of us have been on here since it's beginning think of the car crash job meta have done to it. You are throwing artists, photographers etc under the bus by the tiktok style. Even on my dedicated art account I get flooded with reels of recommended accounts when I just want to see the posts in chronological order of who i follow. Plus actually do something about the spam and porn accounts that litter everyone's comments.",1
This app is cool and all but it seriously needs to get all the bugs fixed in the log in process I cant even log in and I changed my password 4 times already,1
After the last update reels aren't playing smoothly as usual it starts off fine but after a few seconds it starts to kind of crash like it changes speed to slower,1
"App is constantly changing, to match competitors, which leads to having to continuously be aggravated with it. Currently trying,and failing, to be like Tik-tok, so you have to scroll through 10 suggests for every 1 of a person, you actually follow. Also, feed is in no order and Instagram dictates what you see, so you'll miss important posts or posts you where waiting on. I've had instances where family posts, where unseen, but according to Instagram, I viewed it and it claimed I had.",1
"My old account got suspended and I don't know even why, Instagram did not give me a reason as to why not helped me with this problem, I confirmed that it's my account through the number and email but I did not get anything in return, no explanation. They forced me to log out of my account and I cannot log back in. I want this issue to be fixed, there are drawings that I don't have in my gallery anymore there and it would be a shame to loose them after all these years.",1
"I have been using Instagram for some years now it's a great app but from few days it's not working. Nothing appers on the screen. It's blank. and shows error, couldn't refresh. And the reels are not even scrolling. Please take of this as soon as possible .I hope that this gets fixed very soon..........",1
"Terrible app now , too many reels being shown and can't unblock or stop them , when trying to upload photos you edit them go to upload them then they rearranges you're pic they uncelrealize them annoying as",1
Iam Instagram since 2018 in this new update so many bugs can't make reels that's showing the video recorded is too short. Please try again how to solve it,1
I cannot share my screen in video calls. Even after updating it each time Instagram has not provided me the lastest version.,1
"an issue occured where i could not be tagged in posts despite my settings allowing it. i deleted the app, and re-installed only for the app to not open properly at all. now all im being shown is a completely blank white screen when i open the app and now i have to resort to using the website, which is oudated and incredibly slow. i have restarted my phone and re-installed instagram multiple times and nothing is working.",1
"App won't open anymore, when I click the icon it opens for a second showing the Instagram logo before my screen just goes white. Apparently its an issue with android phones and storage according to the Internet but I've not changed anything in the app settings on my phone and I've followed all instructions to fix the issue online. Help",1
I'm starting to have issues with Instagram now. It keeps telling me Instagram stop isn't working and it's not allowing me to check my messages or see if any of my friends are active. What's the point of having Instagram if you can't keep in touch with anybody at all. You guys need to resolve this issue as soon as possible or I'm officially deactivating my account for good!!!!!!!,1
I updated my app 2 days ago & after the update I can't log into my account! Whenever I open the app it shows a blank screen. A lot of people are facing different issues too & I hope you fix our problems asap! Update: It's been more than a month! I can't use Instagram on my phone! Don't you not have anyone who's capable of fixing this? Such a big sns but very disappointing!,1
"This app used to be great and you could scroll for hours...but now that Instagram has gone through a midlife and identity crisis because of TikTok, it's been terrible. More ads than anything. And, if you're trying to run a small business ,just forget it. Nothing reaches anywhere anymore. Put the algorithm back. This new system broke before you started it.",1
"one day i deleted the app but decided to re-download it when it was finished i opened the app but i only got a black screen. I have had to go to chrome for the whole summer and now that im back at work it still doesn't work this is highly annoying and i see a lot of people with this problem it has to be fixed, this is really irritating especially if you talk to your friends and buddys on the app. It needs to be improved because it is agitating.Point proved same way differently. üíØ",1
"Poorly designed. When you open the app it shows you a post, but just as you're starting to look at it the app refreshes and it disappears. If you click a link to an Instagram profile, click on a post from that profile, and then click back to view more from that person, the app takes you home instead of back to that persons profile. Numerous other annoying an not well thought out designs.",1
This app does not work anymore. It won't even open. I can't get on it even on Chrome. I don't get what's going on. It socks because I can't login onto my accounts. You guys need to fix this asap. It really makes me think my account is hacked or something!! Facebook works fine. Very upsetting.,1
"Reels is always glitching. Saying app is non responsive. Lately I can't even open the app without it just closing automatically. I have restart, shut down phone, uninstalled & reinstalled app without any changes. I was having issues with this early summer & I got a new phone thinking it would help. Nope.",1
I don‚Äôt have any reply option in inbox. Mailed you more than 5 times. But you haven‚Äôt fixed it yet. So disappointing!,1
Terrible user experience. Refresshing the feed while you are looking at a post. This happens constantly since new updates,1
"Instagram has been discoloring my images each time I post my digital art, they have been coming out intensely pixelated and discolored and I can find any help on the issue. Reels are awful to work with, cutting off the end of videos, poorly timed clipping, etc... I have been forced to take a hiatus because I haven't found a loophole for this. Please fix.",1
"If you're selecting multiple pictures for a post and switch to reel in the process (by a simple accidental swiping of the persistent post/reel selection menu), all of your selection work is now gone. Absolutely shameful behavior for such a high caliber app. The PM who approved this is an absolute moron, so is the guy who hired him.",1
"Reels, feed, and stories are not loading for almost a week now. WiFi's working well, I've already logged in and out, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, cleared my phone's cache & data, probably did all the troubleshooting I need to do yet the app's still not working like it's supposed to. Hopjng that there'll be bug fixes or updates that will reaolve this, it's frustrating :(",1
"Since the last update the app is extremely full of glitches. The app buffers forever, I can't load stories, search, switch accounts or anything. I have uninstalled and re-installed, cleared the cache...but to no avail !!! It happens at random times, this app is definitely going backwards in development...",1
"I have been trying to post a photo for a few days now but it doesn't allow me to. It says ""unable to load image"".. and it doesn't matter what image it is. Even if I try to re-upload the same image that I've already uploaded... it's as if something broke Instagram. So I came here to see if an update is needed, or if perhaps it's been mentioned by others and it looks like I'm not the only one mentioning this error. If I have Uninstall and Reinstall, then, I will NOT be returning to Instagram.",1
"Reported you about spending limit overboard issue, as i don't see options to edit it, the new spending limit options are restricted, wrote you many times in report section, but the issue isn't solved. I am looking out for a quick solution to it. You should have got a strong trouble shooting team too, or it's worthless üëé it shows, we apologise for the inconvenience, your account gets reinstated soon, but nothing changed here.",1
"Unusable. Constantly encounters some unspecified ""error"", making it near-impossible to log in.",1
"Like many others recently, app stopped working all of a sudden. I have Uninstaller, reinstalled, cleared cache, cleared data, and for about a week now all I get is a blank black screen. Before that, the app wouldn't refresh for about a week, even when trying to post.",1
"Logged out of my account and can't get back to it anymore. Trying to use the app gives only gives the white screen. I've tried to restart my phone and update the entire system , installed and uninsttaled the app, still nothing! Need to use app for my work, and can't do it, really frustrating! Pls fix it!",1
"It sucks. The UI is terrible, the uploading sucks, only works on mobile, and it's plagued with glitches that sometimes don't even let you select photos since it only shows you a handful from your camera roll. You need to uninstall and reinstall it just to get your ability to post back.",1
I have been having problems with posting stories that shows time. Everytime i tend to post something it has military time. How can I change that. Can some help please,1
Instagram was better earlier. Nowadays it has become more like TikTok. I don't know why Insta has introduced Reels section. Some may like it but for guys like me it's sort of a distraction. Atleast give us an option to manually enable/disable this reels section.,1
"Since the most recent update I cannot access my picture gallery and cannot upload a single freaking picture!!! Prior to the update I couldn't upload multiple pictures without it glitching out and kicking me off the app. Now it's even worse, considering I can't even upload one picture. This is beyond frustrating!!!!!! üò°üò°üò°üò°",1
"Had 2 accounts deleted by Instagram for no reason, no human to talk to, just robotic decisions and no answers to why! Absolute rubbish platform of social media, an actual total embarrassment of customer service. Help Centre is the most laughable name every given to your Help Centre! No assistance whatsoever!",1
"There is a glitch which stops me from editing multiple images, where it duplicates the first image onto every editing window so I can't edit or upload my other images.",1
I had reported a bug in my account regularly to the help center and they dont fix it and even give a response. Such a bad response towards the users.,1
There have been too many ads for a long time now. I will hide them and they still come back. I don't click on any sponsored ads. Ever. And yet my entire dam feed is ads! I also do not connect to FB or shop through the site. HATE! And NOW the auto generated captions won't turn off. Mine is set to off and yet there they are. Also the submit option is no longer visible when I try to block an account. And why is there an option to disable auto play videos but it doesnt do anything? Fix your POS app!,1
"I hate being forced into Reels for posts, also the Trim function used to allow adjusting the position of posts, function was silently removed. Every release removes loved functions and interferes with my post flows, latest won't allow me a 1x1 sized cover, no consultation on changes, no option to use old function. If I could give a lower rating I would.",1
"All apps get better by new update but Instagram gets worse. I don't have many features that others have; drawing in stories, videos that are longer than 15 seconds, challenging others in stories are all excluded for me! Also the Instagram screen is still in the old version and I don't get to scroll the reels! Let's not forget that annoying white screen below the options bar. I can't see the loging/signing in page! I have to clear data the google services to see them which temporary! And etc.",1
Now they've started asking me if I'm satisfied with products I've bought when they have no right to know what I have bought and haven't. Trash company. Never wanted to delete an app so fast,1
"it has been a week, but it's still not working properly. i've been reinstalling it, changing wifi connections and switching to data, used my laptop, but it's still not working. all i see is black when i'm opening the app. i badly want to see my faves posts hELLO",1
"Seriously, how long it would take? I still can't post my 60 seconds story . I already updated my ig (again!), but still can't use the new post story longer. Shame on this developer!",1

I had been using Instagram since 2014. My account has been suspended twice. I appealed the second time and still could not log in to my account. There is no help or email that would assist me to why my account was suspended without reason.,1
It's name should be like glitchgram or buggram like seriously everyday I'm facing new problem sometime data isn't loading and many other problems. From past 3 days it disappointed me so much with these problems,1
Worst app. Everytime i upload reels it throws me an error. Done all troubleshooting and still no luck. Why you guys build something you yourself don't understand any bit.,1
Keep auto restart to run in background. Like a rouge app. Take a look at all the permissions this app wants. Definitely a rouge app. And google allows it?,1
"Horrible customer service. Got hacked in less than 30 seconds and it's been over two weeks with no support of any kind. No response to emails, no actual progress. How can you let hackers take over that damned fast while the actual account holders have to jump through miles of hoops and STILL get denied?",1

"I'm not able to post anything. It always shows ""will post automatically "" or ""try again "" and it never posts. My internet works fine but still!",1
How do y'all just make the app worse and worse? How many times do I have to write replies to comments sometimes full paragraphs and hit the send button just for the entire app to NOT post my comment AND delete everything I just wrote... Unbelievable.,1
"I've had this app for almost 12 years & never have I got so many likes or message requests from random people that have porn websites on their bio until 3 or 4 months ago. They see my stories which are public, they probably saw my posts until I put my account on private. I reported every single account associated with porn & instagram never deletes their account. I've blocked numerous accounts & they pop up like weeds the next day. Instagram doesn't do anything, they don't care. Horrible app",1
While trying to Post a Feed on my Account the original sound of the post is not available. The Video Turns Mute with no audio in background. How m i suppose to post the Original Content.,1

Why i am unable to login after enabling whatsapp authentication everytime i give the code it says please check the security code and it also not sending sms and backupcode is also not working. Kindly please do something that account was important for me,1
Horrible. You need better security system for those who get hacked or logged out of their accounts all lf a sudden. I can't log into my accounts anymore because of that,1
It would be amazing if people could speak freely. Not allow nudity to run rampid. I will start to use less.people need to be able to trust privacy and freedom of speech. Instagram gives neither,1

"And now the comments are broken. I can write, I can read, but I can't read what I write while I'm writing it, and you can't accurately edit what's wrong because you can't see what you're doing. On the upside, this is on par for Instagram devs. Still garbage.",1
"I'd rather die screaming than to use this app... Basically it's all controlled by socialism which is the precursor to communism. Moreover, all the fake politically correct nonsense that people are being brainwashed repeatedly through usage into believing as correct. This app couldn't be more incorrect.

Since 2021 am using Instagram but still I don't have messenger update. I can't reply their specific messages. And Instagram not comfortable for chatting.,1

"Keeps crashing as soon as I go for payment options in boost your reel. Facebook is the only company which has such a bad design for products that are actually monetised.

Good for me.",1

There seems a bug in your system. My account got suspended then i contacted the help center and got able to log in back to my account. Few minutes later the account got suspended again and I'm not being able to submit a report to help center now. It's asking me to confirm it's me before requesting a review. What's wrong ? Why ruining the great experience and feedback we used to give to this app?,1

Blocking the entire screen if you want to save or share a reel is one of the dumbest changes you've made. Why? What makes blocking the screen better? Nothing.,1
Keeps asking for a phone number to send a code. Now the app is useless. I would really appreciate if someone got in touch with me to fix this issue and I will change my rating when resolved,1

Always having to change passwords as my account has been compromised. I have had to change passwords so many time I can't remember my current password so I can change it. Why Instagram Just why. Absolute joke,1

"Its sad how i repost something off of someone's and my page gets flagged within 30 minutes. But the original content will stay up for months. All you see on here is half-naked women.

Even the video recognition software they use to verify your identity is completely useless. Now every time I try to prove my identity with a video, the app crashes. This app is filled with bots, bugs and piracy that the founders could care less to address.",1
"The algorithm for displaying photos on feeds ruined intagram. Picture quality and video quality is terrible, and the bots and spam accounts are completely out of hand. Also, there is not real reviews on reports for many of my friends profiles have been deleted out of jealous people reporting their accounts without ever breaking a rule. And instagram does not care about protecting people's safety. I'm quitting instagram in the next month",1
"I'll keep it simple. There're too many bugs, glitches and they suspend people's account with no valid reason. It was better with the old version than now. I wish I hadn't updated it or even install it.",1
"This app has become so flooded with ads that I barely look at stories anymore. Also, I don't need a marketplace. I especially don't need one where my notifications used to be. FB and IG adding these is ridiculous.",1
AYO WHATS WITH THAT NOTES STUFF? Please stop. Also Messages opens up with super old conversations and I cant even see my messages unless I refresh (sometimes twice). Liking messages works 50% of the time... whats up with that?,1
This app was really good a year ago but now tgere are so many bugs glitches and what not it dosen't look like that instagram is app of very big organisation. Whenever i update and open the instagram the deatures are the there is no new update in the app please do something about this and the user name are not shone insted of that instagram user are shown and that user can also message me i cam also message him but i can't see his story and what not abd i want it's reply fast! Please fix this bug,1
Having a very bad experience nowadays..I've been reporting the sponsor (ad) in between the post from last 2 weeks because they all are sexually inappropriate for me and since I've been reporting them u guys are giving those kind of ad again and again now I'm reporting like 20 sexually inappropriate ads a day and you guys are spamming those adds again and again ...what is strong with you..if I'm reporting such kind of content that means I don't like it not like I loved it.do something about it ü§¨,1
"video become total mess because of reel, the quality dropped so bad, the audio sounds glitched, cant post any video on this platform, Please bring back the old video post",1
Instagram is not working properly. Something is definitely wrong. It used to work just fine a month ago but now its full of bugs. Please check the app and fix it as soon as possible.,1
"My Instagram account is not working. Whenever i open the app, it swipes to a black screen which shows something loading on it. But nothing shows up.kindly check.",1
"After the update on 12/9/2022, Instagram is not allowing to scroll through Suggested Posts at all. Scrolling just stops. Cache has been cleared. App is updated. Nothing.",1
"Hey Team instagram,my Instagram app is updated but my reels bonus option is not showing,please provide me this option. I am uploading 2-3 reels daily.Please resolve this issue as soon as possible. Account ID : motive_liger",1
"Said my account is suspended, I clicked on the button to confirm my identity, filled in the code from my email and sms, when I'm about to submit the last code, the app crashed and logged me out of my account, now I can't log back in and I don't know if my verification has been sent",1
"So glitchy the messages are delayed, I'm stuck on a video call that I didn't even start. I can't turn it off, the notifications keep telling me I have mew comments but they're old comments and it just won't go away",1
"It's like they don't even understand that epople just want to share photos with each other. Rather than trying to be every other popular app, but worse, if it just tried to be what instagram originally was supposed to be, but better",1
"I cant share my story above 30 second & there are so many bugs still have problem while sending photos in chats, no reply back option, no wallpaper changing option,and many.",1
Very bad app Instagram in my phone doen't support message reply and reacting feature till now rather than I have the latest version and my phone supports Android 12. I have reported so many times but instagram team is not looking at my report. Hope they will act upon my complaint.,1
"Can finally post again. May never risk updating this app again! And by all means, keep showing me days-old posts just because I haven't clicked on ""like"" on them. üòû And don't tell me which posts got replies when there have been more than 100 likes on my various posts since then.",1
"The hours I've just spent to get a straight up URL of my page to share was freaking ridiculous. The advice online is to literally use 'your other Instagram account to copy your other Instagram account's URL & share it."" Like, how simple would it be to have a ""share my link"" option. How many years have you been in business? Am I the first one to think that this being a 14 step process is stupid?",1
"I have been heavily censored my app force crashes when I try to post something and I cannot access my home screen without it force crashing I feel its because of my race & religion...and I have another ig name and that's fine I have full access and capabilities, but my main account has been hacked by someone or ig/FB themselves.....I feel this app helped contribute to social downfall of society...any advice greatly appreciated thanks.",1
Super buggy with messaging and notifications. Edit: issues still not resolved.,1
I've been asking for help and sending requests for help regarding my account that the post and reels are not syncing or reels not showing up till late in the day I've Uninstalled and nothing seems to work going on a month....,1
"It's so bad 11 days with error message ( try again later we restrict certain activity to protect our community) when I didn't do any of violations sending each day a screenshoot to fix this bug they don't do nothing ,instagram is getting worse with this ( META)",1
A lot of problems updating content. After latest update (October 2022) the app is frozen. Delete and reinstall does not solve problem. Android version.,1
Using a galaxy S4 for the week while my phone is being repaired and this app will not install on the phone no matter what I try. The problem is not the phone. I have downloaded other apps and am running Android 5.1 which is above the recommended 5.0,1
"No way to disable auto play of videos. Absolutely unacceptable. Enable this by default if you must, but give an option to permanently turn it off.",1
The messaging update option is nowhere to be found.. The chat section of the app is unusable.. Imagine you can't even select and reply a message.. That's soo soo bad.. And now one is willing to help fix that problem!!,1
"Worst app ever. So many bugs. The reels uploaded do not get reviews. Instagram play smart as they deliberately don't boost your reels views so we pay them to boost it. But once the boost limit is over, the views will stop coming. Hate this app.",1
There was too many bugs and glitches in this app 1st is when I see any reels or story the video get stooped and music is continuously running . 2nd is lagging please Instagram fix this problem .,1
I can't reply on any messages and when I tried to delete my account on android they say error please wait a few minutes before you try again I waited and did it for 2 hours. They really should fix how to delete an account like please if someone wants to delete there account just make it easier not going through all of this so frustrating to be honest,1
"full of ads. boring now. moving to 500px. biased approach to political matters. poor and unethical censorship. I'll find better social media apps soon. and hate the video chat heads. I don't know who makes these annoying things. As if the app was already not poorly designed and the algorithm, now we are forced to see contents from the account that we don't even follow in our feed. This is ridiculous. I don't want to see that üí© and that's why I'm not following them.",1
"My feed is always blank. Stories do not show up. I have to constantly refresh my DMs in order to get messages. Constantly getting ""cannot refresh feed"" message.",1
So many bugs and worst support system. Data doesn't load in my account. Tried with different devices also but it doesn't fix.,1
"My account has been banned for no reason, I hadn't posted anything on the feed nor on my story in quite some time and out of the blue they decided to just deactivate my account. I tried to appeal multiple times only to be met with the same problem during the process: it either hadn't accepted the picture of my ID card or it requested me to verify on IG that it's me who's trying to log in- how do I do so if it won't let me log in cause it has been banned?! Help Center is of no help whatsoever.",1
"Its horrible, for the last few months instagram has been nothing but bugs. I cant post reels anymore because of a bug theres other bugs i will nit mention because there are so many but im sure others are leaving reviews talking about those. (I will likely add to this review later)",1
I can't see all reels currently. Sometimes out of 10 reels able to see only one and then rest of the reels are coming as black screen.,1
"This app is just sticking onn!! Everytime I open it,it just keeps refreshing and don't load any posts it's very irritating!!please make sure the solution of these issues.I hope the Instagram team will help me :)",1
PLEASE REMOVE SUGGESTED POSTS. There's no point in following people if I can only see a few of my friends posts before app starts showing me things that it thinks I want to see. If I wanted to see things from people I didn't follow I would go to the explore tab. I get Instagram makes money off ads and people seeing influencers but I would rather see posts from people I actually follow. Just give us a setting where we can see our friends posts in chronological order by default. Zero star app rn.,1
"Fix the comment section, when I want to open replies it doesn't show all of them, e.g. it says ""open for 20 more replies"" but then it only opens 10 or so and doesn't give the option to open further ones, can't ever see my own replies when I open them, has been an issue for MONTHS",1
"Instagram doesn't count any new followers on my account (raquelmarcioart) I report every time and I never get a response. I always get notifications of new followers but the app doesn't count the new followers on the profile, and it doesn't count on my professional dashboard either. Follower numbers started to disappear But the app doesn't count the supposed unfollows in the professional dashboard either, that's really disappointing, Honestly, I expected more from Instagram...",1
"Okay so I'm a old user as you can say, So I actually have 2 accounts, the first one is my main account and the another personal account which is for my closest friends and cousins but when I tried to log into my 2nd account it didn't worked, My phone number and password was totally correct but still It didn't let me logged in, whenever I'm trying to log in it's showing ERROR. In another hand I can't even make another account it's saying ""please wait a few minutes before trying again""",1
"Worst experience ever, too many bugs and glitches. My account got deleted on its own and now i am unable to access it anyhow. I lost my all conversations and memories which i had on this platform. Much much disappointed.",1
Ive actually tried to login multiple times but none seems to he working. Soo this app is really badddd I like got the app and when I logged into Google I missed many message..so the app doesn't really work for messages..it's the Google site..please work on this..it gets annoying,1
"Recently it has been crashing without any reason. Neverthless removing cache, updates, entire stored data and reinstalling the app haven't solved the issue.",1
Nothing on my account is working. Not loads. All of my messages are gone. Can't see posts from anyone. Search feature in app is gone. Only thing I can see is my profile image and my account name.,1
"Ads are the first post I see when I open IG. Sometimes I see a post and when I like it, it automatically refreshes and the post disappears. It doesn't show up in my feed at all, so I have to search up the account and look for the post. How obnoxious.",1
"Home feed is too busy, and posts are not chronological. There should be an option to remove suggested posts entirely. I also don't care about what people I'm not following are doing. I'd prefer to only know what those I follow are posting. Everyone else, I don't care about.",1
It is so stupid that you can't pause the videos. Not being able to pause conpletely ruins the app. What a waste of time.,1
"The App has been malfunctioning for about two weeks... I need yo install and uninstall the app severas times at Day and It still not working... Many bugs, many glitches, no content updates....",1
"It's lame. Ya get all the added security, but when it comes to getting a confirmation text to regain access to your account, you get nothing and no response from anyone to help you with the problem.",1
I don't have options to highlight a message and reply to certain messages when talking to my customers and there is no option for me to react to a specific message and other people are using these options that makes me feel bad,1
I just woke up to 8 fake accounts adding me overnight. I've reported/blocked as many as 15 in a day at one point during this past year (2022). Nice to see that Instagram has systems in place to protect their users (sarcasm). Idk whats worse the fake foreign accounts or the adds you run. They're probably the same thing.,1
Constantly have to uninstall and reinstall to get this broken app to work the way it should. Reinstalling it only fixes the problems for a little while. The app won't let me edit the location of photos on my feed.,1
"Instagram automatically suspended my original account without any reason, I was just opening the insta and it shows your account has been suspended, how can be this possible without any reason to suspend my account in case of no suspicious activity is found or no any reason. Please resolve this issue and give access to my account.",1
"It's been around a month now, it seems this is caused by a bad update or something. But i cannot for the life of me open and read the comments of posts, even when it shows there are comments. There is also the other issue of having a notification for every like you receive on every comment. I can be confident in telling you that 99%of your users do not care to know what likes they get for comments when they can't even see the replies to their comments properly because of all the notifications.",1
Can't see and save profile picture. Can't save post picture and video like other social medias. This app needs some improvement to be better than other social medias.,1
Please look after the glitches it's very annoying for me to use Instagram bcz everytime I open Instagram videos are not playing properly the feed is not loading and all my messages are deleted for sometime and than again it comes back.,1
"My app suddenly can't be opened. When I redownload it, I can't login to my account. And when I try to reset my acc's password, it's always error. ü§∑",1
Very bad update.. ! In messages- cannot react with emojis to messages..and the option to reply tagging in chat has been not available! What a bad update.. feeling irritated! What update sessions are you people doing! Worst update! Requesting to give all the options back ASAP!,1
"All the time you block me for no issue I loose alot if you not competent sell it to someone ready to deliver good service, Instagram just turned the worse social media app they were best when they first came out everyone is subjected to the brown envelope ü§£ü§£ü§£",1
"Agreeing with all the latest 1 star reviews here. Not updating because apparently you apocalypsed your app even further (if that was possible). Im just lingering to support other artists I follow until you force an update, then I'll quit Insta and find the best alternative :)",1
This app barely functions. Posting photos and videos is clunky at best and things lag/stall. It's pretty basic stuff.,1
This app does not work well with my Samsung G22 Ultra. The pictures will not always display. Sometimes pictures won't load. The app works perfectly fine on my Samsung G20.,1
"I wish I could give 0 stars as I constantly have videos and pictures that are ""popular in my country"" or that Instagram thinks is interesting show up in my feed that I have absolutely NO interest in. it'll go from what I look at & watch on a daily basis to random pictures & videos I do not search or look at ever, it takes over my feed for days before I finally mark enough pics & videos as not interested. I don't get why this happens? what basis are you going off of for these suggestions??",1
"Absolutely pathetic support.. In my insta messenger the reply option to a particular message is not available, i have written to resolve this issue a number of times but they don't fix it. Very disappointed.",1
"I don't know what happened recently, but I'm seeing a lot of ads in reels. And also my recommended type is not shown. Uninstalling it :(",1
"For some reason I can't log in from a new phone, it says that it can't find my account even though on my other phones and pc I'm logged in to that exact account. When I try to use option to reset password it says ""error, please try again later"".",1
"If it were up to me I would give you 0 starts. I have tried to log in but it keeps on saying I should wait a few minutes .I have waited and waited, I have uninstalled the app serval times but still. Please try and fix the problem.üôè",1
"I have use to update every week i really was love this app , but this time so many bugs i can't post a post i cant post story's too , EDIT now i cant login to my existing accounts its showing error are you uploading updates just to make us get MADE . for who read this my acc was more than 1k and now i can't login because Instagram won't send pin to have access to my acc i tried to send over three days but insta didn't send to my email the pin",1
Instagram suspended my account like this why....I neither abused your policies ever nor I could think of this still Instagram suspended my account and now I am not able to login to my both the accounts...I want my both accounts right back .... It's really very disappointing for me and if I don't get them I will never download Instagram and will also deactivate my facebook's account. please take a quick action.,1
"Idk why this app is showing the same error again and again.While logging in, It shows ""please wait a few minutes before you try again"" Everytime i try to sign in it shows the same? Please solve the issue.",1
Can't login. It keeps saying the account doesn't exist. I tried loging in using Facebook but still says try again later. Tried uninstalling then reinstalling. Its still saying the same thing. What a waste.,1
Worst app ever after downloading I can't create account and also I tried using my Facebook account to sign up but still it does not work it only shows try again after some minutes.. You guys should repair this app i always get trouble login why now,1
Very worst these days. For last 10 it doesn't working at all. Also I tried many times to install and uninstall but allit says couldn't refresh feeds . Mamy of them are reporting but no action taken. Such an irresponsible. They are satisfied with celebrities only,1
"The recent update crashes all the time and none note are able to see , messages are unable to send! Please fix the app.",1
All this AI and it can't take edit right ? It keeps giving me error when trying to post something. Couldn't edit any picture. It just sucks.,1
"there is no way to access drafts, or they're not getting saved when you pick the option in the first place? not sure which, but sucks either way",1
"The app is getting worst day by day I am trying to post on my feed since past four days and it ain't happening....i done everything updated my Instagram, logged out and login again but nothing is happening.My net speed is also good and I m not able to share any boomerang or something.",1
This app was very ridiculous.. with out any reason disabled my account.. I worked hard to gain followers.. it took me 3 years .. I'm model .. facing lot of issues to retrieve my account.. I need my account .. I sended lot of mails and requested instagram to review the decision .. but there is no response from instagram,1
"It would be great if I could log into my account, which, even after logging into Facebook, it says my account doesn't exist??? I'm logged into my tablet just fine and Facebook says my account is active, so what gives?!",1
Deleted My account for a small reason. That too it happen mistakenly. I have a lot of memories in my Instagram also lot more passwords related to my social media and back accounts. Please return my account. I will keep my life goal to bring down Instagram rating. Im a student I can make count 100 1stars per day and a lot more to come. Need Immediate answer for my question.,1
Always have issues trying to post. Says it can't post and try later and the only way I can get it to post is by sharing from other platforms. Smh very annoying and sent plenty of requests for help and never get any. Wasted so much time trying to post,1
It was my very bad experience with this app my account was compromised and yet it's not recovering. I have remembered old password and keep doing try many times but it's not happening don't know why ....I would like to you pls if u can pls help to recover my account pls...pls....,1
My account has been hacked into utilising Instagram's own services.. I can't log back in and when I try to change the password I'm asked for a backup code. It's been ridiculous trying to liaise with Instagram customer services - absolutely pointless,1
"Absolutely awful app at the moment. Constantly banned from following accounts, liking posts, commenting on posts. It's a joke! It's my account I should be able to engage with others. You can't see if someone is following you back. You have to go onto that account and review who they follow. This all needs fixing ASAP! Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è I hope this feedback helps improve your app and service.",1
"Stop with the unknown account!!! That's really annoying I hate the feed I don't see my friends or the account I like or a little, I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR PROPOSAL ! Everyone hate this new things, it get things worse than ever. The old way with ONLY the people we follow was perfect, why do that ? Your killing this app really.",1
I am using this app from last 5 years it's very good no doubt but from 10 to 15 days i am facing a problem in the update of this app note sections is Missing i have reinstall it many times and even report the issue but there is no response from you so i request uh to solve mah problem.... thank you..‚ú®,1
"More than 50% of the time, the first post on my feed is an ad. Cannot scroll more than 5 posts without seeing an ad. Cannot watch more than 3 stories without seeing an ad (usually 2). Instagram has stepped up their greed since Zuckerberg blew so much money on Metaverse BS",1
"I've been impersonated and harassed, targeted and bullied, and Instagram has done absolutely nothing to help. Worse, I'm not the only one who has been affected by the person who is doing this to me, and Instagram just doesn't care. It makes me furious.",1
Instagram app is crashing frequently. It even freezes calls. All my incoming calls while using Instagram goes to missed call not showing.,1
I think Instagram has more than enough resources to allow Android users to completely delete all of their posts from a saved collection. I can remove them from collection but they are atill saved. What sort of utter idiot came up with that idea?,1
"The app has been showing me the same 3 posts from 1 user that I follow. I am not seeing any new content from any of the other 500 accounts I follow, however I continue to receive unsolicited suggested accts to follow. It's been going on for the last week and I have Uninstalled and reinstalled several times.",1
"Made a new account because my other email was deleted and hacked and now Instagram won't stop disabling my account even though I have put the codes in on my phone number and new email and I cannot find a way to contact to fix the problem, so disappointed used to live the app but now can't even get on it",1
"Recently I switched my phone. And Instagram is not letting mei login in my new phone. It says invalid I'd, when intry forget password it says try later, when I try logging through Facebook it says another error. Basically can't login have been trying for a week now.",1
"I have not been able to get into my account for days. When I try and log into the account it says that the account does not exist, But when you search up my account it's still there. I also cannot create a new account or log into a different account. Please fix your app.",1
Pathetic app. Reels can't be uploaded. Installed multiple times still the same. If you can't control the features why give the features at all. It's completely stupid.,1
"I scroll down, I see two posts from people I follow, 3 ads and then it goes to suggested posts. Then, after refreshing 10 times, I finally see other posts from people that I actually follow, then more ads and more suggested posts. I cannot see more than two posts from the 50 people I follow, of which there are about 10 new posts a day from them collectively. Sometimes it just doesn't show me the posts either. Worst social media app ever. Update: it doesn't show smaller accounts posts. Ever.",1
"STOP FORCING REELS! I do not like reels Sam I am. Not in a house. Not in a car. Not in box with an ox. No, I do not like reels Sam I am. They are designed to make you addicted to them and they are designed to take your life away, they will make it so anything that isn't constant stimulation seems impossibly boring.",1
The app is showing all caught up since two days at top of my feed. When I went to report the bug I'm getting notification every 5 mins that problem was not reported. Dome on the web version.,1
Im uploading multiple images. Won't save my edits and cropping and is making black border on some pics but its not there when editing. Awful.,1
Useless app! Once I reset the password and out from app. It shows I need to type security code from authenticar app. But the thing is I have reset my phone due to some reason I have to reset my phone but once I reset I can't get my security code eventhough I redownload the authenticor app! Plz don't download!,1
This app keeps changing every few months hope for the better of its users coz its confusing to some of us now with payed IG ads aint like it used to in past what used to works few months ago now smthn totally diffrent keepn updating on new updates but some of this updates jus ruins the app still has glitches buggy updated the new update lets see some of this errors if are fixed? Tried sometimes cleaning cache force stop used to fix some of the errors.,1
My account was disabled wuthout nu permission and without any particular reason. Never expected this from this application. I had my pictures and memories. Please fix it if you can,1
"This issues have been going around these past months! Most of the time I posted stories, it won't save in the archive although i did switch on the archive save !! Now all of my memorable memories are gone! Fix it god",1
"I didn't getting messenger updateüòñ The messenger update is diecasting. All r having swiping method, emoji reply but in my instagram account didn't got thatüò• Hello sirrr... I didn't get new version instagram messenger. you guys didn't checked it I have so much problem in messenger. In others mobile rection reply is there here only we r like messages instead of this can't do anything plz check it. I mentioned this problem 6 month ago no any responde and no any changes has doneüò¢please work onIt",1
"Feed not even Showing up now. Reels getting stuck, reels automatically scrolling to top. Bugs are endless and getting tired of Instagram because of them.",1
"They suspended my account for no reason and when I submit the verification selfie, the app freezes and doesn't submit the picture. It's actually ridiculous.",1
Instagram pushes down simple posts. One has to make reels & videos to get noticed. A simple picture doesn't do anything. Earlier it was not like that. My work got more reach than what it does now. We'll soon need another platform to promote our work.,1
"In the last month I've found the app become extremely slow and laggy, if I follow or unfollow someone it'll only be counted in my following list every 24 hours, in my following list it won't load the earleist/latest followed option and posts take a while to load. Very dissapointed. This needs to be fixed urgently.",1
Scrolling and liking posts and bam verify I am human or whatever? Sure fine annoying but whatever. But then it failes to upload due to some error kept trying for few hours still nothing clearing cache and memory nothing. Proceded to reinstall and now the app gives black screen after logging in. And not interested doesn't seem to work.,1
"Really don't think it's user friendly AT ALL, best used as an unofficial dating app or something. The worst part where it deserves a 1 star rating for me, os because I can't download photos from art pages I follow on my phone without third party software.... Like... WHY. Give the uploader an option if he wants to allow downloads or not. Awful app, 0 user friendly.",1
Feed isn't stable. It refreshes too much on its own. I'm reading a post and suddenly it is gone and some other post comes up. This is just so Instagram can get as much impressions for its accounts without actually any benefit to the reader. ü§¶,1
"Time is not far away when we have to uninstall our favorite app Insta as it has started showing old watched posts on opening and even on refresh which is frustrating. If it's a bug, please try to fix it asap. If it's a feature, be ready for mass uninstall!",1
"The app is glitchy. They logged me out of my 3 accounts and I was only able to gain one back,I did the forgot password thingy and I havent gotten any link for me to reset my passwords. Not sure why. Edit: on top of that, I always get my notification last minute or I don't even get them. It's not even a internet issue either that's causing this it's just the app in general sometimes.",1
The app has been working so well though of recent I cannot access my account because of the two figured authentication backup codes given. I keep trying to put them in but they tell me that they are wrong yet they are the ones I was given so I honestly don't know what to do because there is no way I can access my account without them. Please help me out.,1
Ruined the app. Bring back the explore tab. I don't want to watch recommended reels. I don't want to waste time watching something I don't want to watch. And bring back the pfp zooming feature. If it concerns privacy give options to who can zoom it and who can't. I want people to see my pfp,1
"Most suffocating social media app. Can't even download people's pictures, the censorship is ridiculous, and don't get me started on how oversimplified it is. Easy to find art though. Doesn't work on wifi anymore. ALSO apparently they made the size of buttons even smaller so when trying to heart a post, it does something else entirely unless I press the exact center of the heart. Trash design.",1
Very buggy in dark mode and no foreseeable updates to fix those issues. I have to re-open the app just to read captions. This version of OS didn't have day/night mode setting yet other apps seem to handle simply great.,1
"What a disaster. No one wants to fix these bugs. Meta, SUCKS when it comes to combining two dysfunctional apps that allow bots to choose whats right and wrong and majority of the time its an error. How come when I reactivate its saying that my account is Disabled?! Are you guys just lazy to not fix the problem? Ridiculously poor quality. Get it together.",1
"I cannot give less than 1 star... I just downloaded your app and tried to figure out how to start. Your app froze 2 times, i closed and reopened it and finally entered into settings. While trying unsuccesfully to open a personal blog i got the message that my account was suspended (why?) and you will review your decision. I chose to contest your decision and it's a half an hour since i should have received a 6 digit code... Good bye and good luck!",1
"Generally I like it but when i watch a video I don't have a puase button, o i have to leave the whole app, even when I leave the app the video will be starring over once I resume watching üòë There was a puase button before, where did it go ! Not to mention the feature of speeding the video or slower one, I don't have them anymore üòë",1

"Its very good app to share things with old nd long distance friends, best part is reels, awesome features,, BUT i have one problem since few months that there is no option to save any reel in gallery.., this is only with me, not anyone else... Please fix this issue",1
"There are so many bugs. When i watched reels and used camera features suddenly the app closed. I also restarted my phone but it didn't cause any changes. It annoys me so pay attention to this problem, please! Thank you.",1
"This app is doing wrong to people's phones, they are taking your data and privacy even after you turn the location off they are turning it on without permission. They must be stopped at all cause, I'm going to report it and get a lawyer because I keep on finding my location turned on only by Facebook and Instagram no matter how many times I turn it off. They do not have permission to enter my phone without permission. It is a dangerous app. This app is selling your information",1
"So many bugs. Reels glitch so much after you post them and look entirely different once posted. After I've posted a reel I can't save it. Says it's saved to camera roll, but it's nowhere on my phone. I guess I'll make content on tiktok and move it across? ‚úåÔ∏è",1
"When I first got Instagram, it was great. But now it's has sooooo many ads, I scroll through 4 ads before I see a post from someone I'm following. Also, there is not a page on here that doesn't have naked girl ads. I can't look at pictures of trees without seeing some anime girl posing for money. It's become and Only Fans App. Very sad to see.",1
"No, Just no, everytime I open my Instagram it starts turning to a white screen, then it says, ""message"" ""status"" ""fail"" I am not happy with this. Overall if I try to check my feed it turns to the white screen, if I wanna see my account it turns to the white screen, please fix this app. It has tons of bug issues, I am mad üò°.",1
It sucks I can't get more than 10 photos I would appreciate it if it could be a minimal of 20 to 40 pictures I like to create reels with more than 10 photos but it's impossible to do that. And comments on my posts keep disappear. What the hell you removed collaboration post why did you do that the was one oth the best parts of this app,1
Super glitchy. Crashes constantly. After the 8th try you ask yourself why you even bother. I use it less and less frequently because sharing content has been so frustrating. Almost unusable unless all you want to do is scroll reels.,1
"App as big as this should work with its most fundamental features at all times. Being unable to edit photos before posting, because it gets stuck and repeatedly shows only the first photo from the stack available for editing is pure failure",1
"I'm literally so sick of this app. I open the app and start enjoying a post and within moments the page refreshes and the post is gone and I spend the next 20 minutes trying to find that post. I know it happens on purpose so you'll stay on insta trying to find that post and I'm done feeding into it. It's cheap and irritating. Surely there's other ways to get people to stay on the app. Until it changes, I'm done.",1
My Facebook and Instagram accounts were hacked on Oct 8th and were disabled subsequently. There is no way to contact anyone to fix this and the fill out form to review your account doesnt go through because there's a message that pops up and says they dont have enough staff to review accounts because of Covid-19. Years worth of memories are now inaccessible because of incompetence.,1
"At this point, the app is barely functional. Half of the time a feature will be there one day and gone the next. What happened to the story views? And what's with the emphasis on videos? I installed this because it's a photo sharing app. Nobody wants a knockoff tik tok.",1
"Full of bugs. Uploading photos no longer works properly, which I thought was the whole point of Instagram! Stop pushing unwanted reels at us and trying to be tiktok, get back to why people started using insta in the first place.",1
Experiencing issues while login more than one account at a time. Earlier the maximum limit was 5 accounts could be logged in at a time but now you can't even access your own account properly. Whenever you'll try to login it will show that please try again later can't process right now. Same situation is happening with my friend as well. In Every device i try to login same error.,1
"Whenever I finish making a reel with an audio, the final products audio is cut off at the end for a few seconds. I've been having this problem for A LONG TIME. Please fix and update, it has been a while.",1
"this app is really slow. doesnt send messages on time, lags, shows offline/online status when in fact not, shows your message has been seen when it hasnt been seen please fix it or make an update bc I'm honestly so done w this app and it's the only one I like the layout of. thank you",1
"I received a notification about a log in into my account from an unknown device, I changed password to block the attempt and got logged out. I've neither been able to log back in nor been able to use the forgotten password option. I'd appreciate if it could be rectified as soon as possible cause I can't afford to lose that account",1
"Extremely irritating when it keeps refreshing on it's own. In the middle of watching or reading a post it goes to the top ""refreshing"". You guys need to know that we do have the basic knowledge of ""how to refresh Instagram manually"", so kindly give us back our right to refresh the page on our own will.",1
Glitches it doesn't installs in the very first time . Although on play store it shows installed it dosent open and in my app list it dosent even show it . I have to click the open button multiple times then after clicking it for around 20-35 times it opens. It is frustrating and irrating thing . Kindly do fix it or inform me if this is a problem from my side . Thanks and Request üòÉ,1
"I was browsing the web when I suddenly started getting ""agree to terms"" pop ups. I closed the app but then 5 min later it popped up again. I was forced to press agree to stop the pop ups from happening. The app wasn't even on.",1
"If you don't post videos with the exact audios that Instagram wants, the algorithm basically does not care about you or your content. Also have fun never seeing any of the content you want to because your feed is basically filled up with ads and influencers who have the most followers. Recommendation if you want to see the people you follow, click on the top left Instagram label and click following. It's basically old Instagram and chronological order.",1
This is a biased app üñï.For IOS and android users it's having totally different interface. Its having way better features for IOS compared to the android. Like IOS users can easily change the background of the reel in their story but on the other hand android users have to do a course on photoshop to do the same üëé,1
"Time loss! I've been trying to record reels several times and the texts get squished and deformed, you spend a lot of time trying to make a good video but then.. BANG instagram made you of fool not working properly! Not speaking about choosing a particular audio and the app change it for another! ANNOYING!",1
"super buggy. horrible ads everywhere. i miss just seeing pics of my friends on my home page, not random suggested posts. is that not what the explore page is for? wish i could disable the shopping page, i will literally never buy anything via instagram and i'm certain others agree. i miss the digital scrapbook vibes of early instagram; now it's just trying to be too many things.",1
"Ads, if I want to look at a billboard I'll go for a drive. Everything Microsoft, Google, Apple or Facebook (META) touches are turned into ads. Been spending hours a day on this app, now it's a few minutes a week and getting less.",1
"Just so glitchy. So, they somehow made two sept accounts for me with the same info, so if I ever needed to log out and back in, I'm screwed. I (finally) got ahold of someone who merged the accounts. Now, I have a new phone and I'm trying to log in, and it's not saying there's no account I can log into with either my email or username.",1
"Stop bringing the explore thing on my home page please, let it be on explore page. I will rate once again when that thing stops happening. Edit:- so since the explore thing stopped coming on my home page I'm giving another two star and I'm really glad that the explore page has stopped refreshing on its own.üëç Edit 2:- 1 star for suspending my account for no reason, not only mine but my whole group of friend.",1
"My account was deactivated for no reason for breaking community guidelines. I don't even post often, definitely nothing inappropriate. I followed the instructions to verify my account, entered my phone number and the codes received in my email and via SMS. Now the page is loading up infinitly. I tried to requesting a review and they refused to send it because "" I did not verify my account first"". Yes, I did! This situation is unfair and stressful.",1
"11/1/22: Adding a previously taken photo to your story is mind numbingly not user friendly. The old way to post a story is significantly better. Do better, Meta. ffs Ever since it was updated to not show the exact number of likes a post gets my feed has been having an impossible time loading anything new. I'll refresh and only the top post is something new and the rest of the feed is the exact same stuff. I follow tons of people, too, so I know that I'm missing something someone had posted.",1
"The only thing that seems to work in the app is that I can see my own profile. I've tried to contact support a couple times, but heard nothing. There are no violations showing up in that section. I've tried reinstalling the app and logging off and back on.",1
"If I get a notification, this app turns my screen off and freezes until the battery dies. WeChat can't be used for long periods of time with Insta on the same phone. This is a terrible app. It has caused me very serious problems. I have not begun ""special negotiations"" with the development team yet. Insta is full of people who need to be taken out of our lives and nation. Who will protect us from this filth? Perhaps the main culprits are the dev team.",1
"It becomes so laggy, so many glitches and bugs. It is very difficult to use this application nowadays. Sometimes it doesn't open properly, I have to clear data of application to open it again. Please do something about the lag and bugs, otherwise users don't use instagram again.",1
"Using dark mode. After extarnal link closure. Half of instagram becoms light moded. So background and text color is white or light gray... It happens all the time.

And all highlights was deleted: ""This story is unavailable"".",1
"Stop sending me notifications. What part of I don't want these notifications does the settings not understand. Not just for 8 hours, not just for a while, I straight up don't want constant notifications each time I open my phone or haven't been on the app for a while. I deleted Snapchat for the same reason, and I'll do it here too if you don't stop sending me notifications I opt out of, that I don't care about. Messages? Sure. Everything else? Don't need it. I'm not famous, so shut up.",1
"This app is really annoying! Whenever I try to open my account the message that always popped up on my screen says my account has been blocked from taking this action. Like, hey! I did nothing I just opened my account and when I reached the said date it apparently happened again. Please fix this problem.",1
Recent days I'm experiencing lots of issues. I have a proper internet connection and other applications are working fine but Instagram is not loading any of the posts and even can't search properly. No recent posts are publishing and some times when i try to add a post or tell the app doesn't load my photo or videos from gallery.,1
"There is some kind of bug in the new update. Instagram will not load any content in my feed. I can see one ad (the same ad for over 24 hours now) and when I scroll past it, Instagram tells me ""you're caught up"" to all of the posts in the past 3 days. Instagram has not told me that for 6+ years. I follow 4000 accounts. My DMs and stories are updating though. Although I have logged out, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, restarted my phone, logged back in, nothing fixes it.",1
Hey..!! Everything is fine in my account but I'm talking about some new features of Instagram that you recently added. I can't use these new features like notes and save option in reels. And i am face this problem from long time. I can't use new features and everyone use same those features instantly. I am also reporting these problems many times but i can't see any improvement. Plzz help me to fix the glitches & bugs and improve my account.,1
Despite updating and restarting my phone numerous times I still don't have double tap emojis nor have I the option where you just swipe the particular msg in order to reply while my friends have this option since long. Choosing random users to use extra features I don't think is a good idea.. pls fix this issue..don't select random users.,1
"this app has so many issues, i had to delete this so many times and it's still not working, i can't log into my another account even thought i know the password, when i want to repost stories there is black screen,the messages don't want to show or i can't send them, i tried so many wifis and it still doesn't work, please fix this app because it's lagging and it doesn't work, instagram has never been as bad as now, i would give 0stars to this app but it doesn't let me so i'm giving 1 star",1
"Are you ever going to fix remixes? Ya'll want us to use reels SO BADLY, but can't fix the bugs for us?! REMIXES ARE LITERALLY BROKEN FOR EVERYONE. So many issues posting remixes from layouts being smashed to look rediculous and awful to the original reel in the remix pausing halfway through the vid, rendering it useless as a remix!! Why are even using this?! Might as well do tiktok, where at least it works right.",1
Absolutely dismal with app stability on Android phones. I don't think they allocate any engineering effort for improving android (OnePlus 9R) experience. Extremely glitchy with app crashes almost all the time. Rarely does a reel/ post / story get published without an app crash Please release the app as an apple only if you don't intend to work on androids well,1
"Can't get the verification confirmation code, its been over 5 days. Please help. Tried - updating app, un-install then re-install app, updating Android version on phone. I even logged it out and logged it back in but now it won't open properly and I'm getting no notifications. Checked and confirmed with service providers if sms isn't the issue. I have two accounts on same Gmail ID and phone, changed details of the other one and even that didn't work. PLEASE HELP.",1
"Terrible. Apparently, there is a compatibility issue with new Samsung Galaxy smartphone. I just switched to a Galaxy S22 from an S10. IG works fine on the old phone and my pc. When I try to log on with the S22, it presents my account name, but when I click on it, it says no account exists. Trying to log in or start new account, I get error telling me to try again later.

"Whats wrong with this instagram ? , after keep on sending not interested for some specific type of reels also , they are keep on popping up ! , and sometimes we cant be able to send a video which is one time and after clicking on resend again and again also it wont go , this app is being a joke these days !",1
"Why is that? Every time I open the stories of my friend which I had viewed already for 10times it keeps showing the same stories all over again Why? Just when I thought there was a New stories still it's just the same stories I had already viewed, Please fix this problem, your making me confused! There is an error in the system. Viewed stories or just opened stories appears to have new stories because it indicate with the highlight circle on profile picture, but when I Opened it still the same",1
"Currently can't look up my saved audios the normal way, it gives a message ""something went wrong. Please try again"". Like will you please just remove these stupid bugs, this the nth time trying to figure out where my saved audios are gone.",1
"It is very annoying how when you open this app, it loads a new post for 1-2 seconds, then moves it way down after you've already read half of it. I suspect this is some type of manipulation technique, and I very much dislike it. My rating will be 1-star until this is fixed.",1
"The algorithm is trash. It keeps showing up reels i don't want to see, no matter how many times i mark them as not interested. The general UI it's so buggy, it won't show comment replies and I could just go on forever. Fix it :)",1
"Just 1 star because without it, my feed won't be posted, otherwise, consider it no rating at all. 1st of all, my account's been hacked and IG team didn't help me out getting it back. Made a new account and it's super buggy. Less engagement regardless of time frame I post as if I post and share for myself. Then, I can't share netflix show wallpapers via Netflix to ig stories. Can't even click a link in someone elses' story link. Super annoying app, with time it's turning out into.",1
"Changed password and then doesn't allow me to sign in anymore. It keeps sending me through a loop where I get a code which is ignored because they want me to record a video selfie that ""doesn't save"" biometric data. Facebook was deleted already months ago, I'll do the same with this one as is a complete joke.",1
My Instagram is not working since 3 months or more..I even keep it updated but it still doesn't work..I am going through a very worst experience with Instagram..not even a message is getting sent..no stories no posts nothing I can see..it only keeps buffering when I open the app..I have tried doing all the things so that the app work..but nothing helped!,1
"it worked for a while but all of a sudden I got logged out of my account and wasnt able to log back in, and i never even got a code for my account when it asked for the 2 authentication sign in. it didnt work and when i decided to make another account it got disable instantly for being against their community guidelines when i did nothing on either account?? Theres no one I can contact either to get straightend out or tell me what i did wrong. Absolutely ridiculous.",1
"Very glitchy. Something is up. All my uploads have white rims around them and don't adjust to the dimensions I want. It does in edit mode, but when it posts it's not what changes I made to it. It does its own thing.",1
I've been reporting the same bug to Instagram for over 3 years and they have not once fixed it ...whenever I post to my stories my account pretty much shuts down I can't use any basic features for a 24-hour period. After 24hrs when you can NO LONGER see viewers; Everything goes back to normal. F! Off Instagram,1
"The worst social media app ever.. Too many sponsored or reklam posts appearing as if user following them.. Cheating like ""liked by ...."" text with a name who is not any of those the user actually following. If you accidentally interact with a post (just by swiping right or opening text underneath) the timeline fills with thousands of similar posts.. No option for user to make preferences (language, interest areas, etc).. Instagram-AI sucks, it is SCRAPPY!!!",1
"Instagram forced their latest version update on my app, like why?! This app is getting worse and worse, may consider uninstalling‚Ä¶. Accounts hacked too often‚Ä¶. Several of my friends' accounts have been hacked, and they were difficult to gain access back to their own accounts. Now i'm afraid my account may be hacked too. Please make it more secure, Insta.",1
Many of the functionalities. Like replying to a message and effects on messages are unavailable for me. I updated the app to the latest version and the problem still persists. Garbage,1
"Everytime I log in I have to create a new password( which I saved for future use) , and again i try to log in the password created is now wrong password and again I have to create a new one. And you save all data of user including location but not old passwords why?. Another problem is no straightforward option to delete account and its data. Fix these issues.",1

Yes, I am very disappointed now, please pay attention to this review, otherwise I would prefer to go to any other entertainment platform other than Insta.üòë",1
Very buggy lately on pixel 7 pro. Whenever I am taking a video it gets blurry then clear then blurry. Also if I try to zoom in or out gets glitchy and weird! All in all horrible experience and very frustrating! Please push an update to fix this,1
Suddenly in my account there is a lot of problems. I can't open my feeds. Chats are not opening. Following followers nothing can't be seen. Not even the coments or like. Nothing is working in my account. This is used to be my favourite app. But after this all problem this is a ridiculous app. Please look after this all problem within 2-3 days or else i will report this app.,1
"I'm seeing the most basic version of the app which was available on 2019. Sometimes, I'm not even able to reply or react to messages. Unable to add music to stories. There is no response for the concern raised also.",1
I cant upload any feedback for developers . I had already factory reset my phone. I already uninstalled and reinstalled the app a 100 times but i cant even upload my feedback. My app is latest version of app but i can't find swipe to reply option in the app. Kindly fix the bugs of the app by providing a suitable update.,1
"this app is turning into Facebook. too many pointless subcategories. get rid of the Shop, Reels, IGTV, Subscriptions. why can't all videos be consolidated into someone's main feed... üòí it makes the UI so ugly. remember less is more, devs !! also fix algorithm for Story order in my feed. I see so many stories I never open from dud accounts I don't engage with, surely you could push lesser ones up based on how long I stare at/ save their pics üòÖ",1
"Data hungry, no warnings, admittedly I only 6gb data a month plan, but never use that for any other apps, must have turned on allowing it to use mobile data somehow, then it managed to burn through my month data plan yesterday when I don't even remember using it, must have been somehow in the background, they need to warn you or make it easy to set limits on apps like this, uninstalled in protest !",1
The newest update blows. Can't post anything because of the new Alt Text Requirement. The instructions given don't work with Android devices. There should be an opt out feature. They should rewrite the code to automatically add the Alt Text description for visually impaired users.,1
"There is a new bug every day. This is like my 5th review in the last two years, I still don't have anything good to say. Endless feature creep, new bugs with every update, stuff in the app that nobody wants or cares about (marketplace tab??) and UNLIMITED ads. Also, there's a major bot problem. Bots keep liking my story with nude profile pics, gross. I'm waiting for a new competitor to replace your app. I would quit using it but the sad truth is that I can't. It's become ""too big to fail"". 0/5",1
"My account posts, followers, and following numbers have all disappeared. Also, my bio and website link have disappeared. When I navigate to home, the section is blank with no stories. It only shows my stories and my profile photo. I have reported this problem before, and it was fixed, but now the problem has come back.",1
"Even I switched high quality media option to "" never"" in cellular data usage in settings, it still loads High quality media. Please fix this. Give us option to choose low quality media be it on a WiFi or using cellular internet. Often we use our friends cellular internet as mobile hotspot for Instagram reels and stuffs, the setting confuses it with wifi and loads high quality media. Next thing you know, daily data exhausted üò≠. Please fix this. Do not suggest IG lite(it's trash ).",1
"Until now , it was all smooth , but now i cant even see a reel or a motion story , coz it wont load , it just bufffers for a long time without any effect. I hate it now , i have to use the web version to see a reel if i felt like watching one",1
"I don't know why I cannot upload any story, I have tried nearly 100 times or more..reinstalled the app, restarted the phone, tried through my phone's browser, cleared cache, updated the app. Still it shows error. Frustrated with this crazy app.",1
"Current state of the app is frustrating. The ability to reply to dm's was rolled back... Having subset of functionality compared to other phonesets on a fully capable phone (OnePlus 8t) is just cheapish on insta's part. Once fixed, can consider rating other than unacceptable 1 star rating.",1
"Horrible login and password issues. You would think changing your password might lead to a message saying "" password reset successfully"" . There is no msg pop up, causing the user to reset password again out of uncertainty. If the password is reset allow the user to login! Why do you have to wait 24-48 hrs to login. This is ridiculous. You are a big company. Not a small one.",1
"The new update is just as bad. I still can't make any reels or post to my story, the app continues to crash. It's honestly frustrating and upsetting. Please fix this! It's had been this way since June.",1
"Rant in 3...2...1...I'm so sick of literally every 3-5 days uninstalling & reinstalling this app. I have a huge platform and when I share my stories, it keeps crashing. It won't stay open and it's inconvenience. PLEASE fix this bug.",1
"Normally Instagram is fine but once every couple of months it'll tell me I've ""shared my password"" and that more account is compromised, or that I shared my account details to get more followers which isn't true. I'll then be forced to change my password but when I hit ""forgot password"" it glitches and sends me back to the change password screen. Overall, it's just so frequent and annoying and ridiculous honestly. Very disappointing.",1
App continuously crashes when trying to post esp if posting multiple pictures/videos and trying to edit. I just tried 10+ times to post and it glitches or crashes everytime. Never had this problem before the last few months. Even updated my app.,1
"Lately, the app is having tons of problems. Everything is stuck, refresh feed, Messages, reels.. everything is stuck and doesn't update. Tried reinstalling many times, didn't help. Managing with Instagram Lite App as of now. But won't be stuck if problem persists.",1
"Everytime I open Instagram mobile get stucked at one thing and after 10 minutes it switch off automatically... I mean what's happening. Even I'm unable to use external buttons, this is worst experience. And i can show you the bug that i found.. It's very annoyingüòñ",1

"Garbage Support, I lost my old phone number but apparently all the other things I linked to get into my account didn't matter they just wanted the code from a phone number I don't even have anymore, but oh I guess the Facebook account being linked, email, other email, and also my face clearly being in the profile picture and in several posts all didn't matter to them, especially because the support team barely exists it's hard to reach out to them. Absolutely horrible app, with horrible security",1
The Instagram application is automatically uninstalled when the mobile phone battery is completely discharged or manually switched off and then switched on again. I am fed up of downloading applications again and again from play store. Please provide guidance.,1
"If I could rate this zero stars I would. I was messaging with a friend today and my whole account got shut down, deactivated and no longer exists. Said i needed to prove my identity and when i tried it deactivated my account completely. I cant get back in because the app won't even load my information. There are pictures on there that I can't get back. All I was doing was reacting to reels that were sent to me. I have been IG user for many years with zero problems. Maybe it's time to ditch Meta",1
"Impossible to edit pictures in the app If you try to post more than 1 pic and edit them, half of them end up warped and it's so annoying. Also Instagram has been hiding my group chats. ALSO also, someone stole my last account and it's literally impossible to get it back even though it's obviously my personal Instagram. This issue should be easy to fix but there's NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. Account fishing is rampant on insta and they're doing nothing about it üôÑüôÑ",1
"The app keeps asking for security code while it doesn't send any code, sometimes it will ask to try again later but even after you try after one day it won't let you use the account withought security code which it does not send itself.

I can no longer post videos! I've lost so many followers because of this bugüò≠üò° every time I try to post a video it says (cant combine clips right now please try again later.) I've reported this issue multiple times and yet it hasn't been fixed.,1
"Thanks Instagram! I'm now locked out of my account and falsely accused of being a bot! When I try to login, I get a message saying ""Error please try again later"". It's incredibly unfair to be made out to be a spammer when all I was doing was logging in to answer the frequent notifications I was receiving because yesterday was my graduation! What's worse they don't tell how long few minutes is. It's been 12 hours and still can't get in. I might even been banned forever! Thanks a lot Instagram!",1
"It is so slow and not loading. I'm one of the creators and reels option just disappeared. I simply can't post or make reels. And today was important day for me to be active on my Instagram account. I logged out, re installed app but it didn't helped! What's going on with this app?",1

Every time the app crashes and unable to open. Unable to upload story at all. This has been continually happening for 1 month. Update: issue still persists. Story and reel upload keeps loading forever despite having a extreme wifi or 4G connection.,1
"3 days ago my account got locked out and when I tried to sign back in, it asked for a phone number verification. I wouldn't get the verification code even tho my number was right. I tried using an android, iPhone, web browser, incognito, everything but the problem wouldn't fix. Then I submitted a video selfie for verification and my account was verified.

Trying to get my account back and speak to someone is an absolute nightmare! Help pages do not help and cannot speak to anyone directly!,1
"I can't see my group chats! I communicate heavily through Instagram for work and school. There's been a major bug for months that won't let me see group chats every once in a while, on the app or on a browser. It's been so bad that I miss very important messages for days. Please fix this!!",1
Can't edit individual photos on a post now. The preview pic at the top is the first photo throughout but the filter selection row has the correct image. Uninstalled and reinstalled a few times but the issue remains! üò°üò§,1
App seems to have lot of bugs sometimes all of sudden it will turn into the oldest version can't reply or react to any of the messages its very irritating and then suddenly again it will be as before.. I mean it does happen to be however it want n wt can we do then ??? Please respond üôèüôèüôè,1
"Sometimes when i scroll through reels, the reel only showing a black screen without any sound or anything, and then i scroll to the next reel the video is stuck still but the sound just keep playing until it finishes. Fix it!",1
"Hello Instagram , Here I'm your user and I downloaded instagram about 1 months ago and I suffered with a glitch. I can't swipe messages to reply for some specific messages as well as I even can't react for messages , reels and photos. So, please fix this bug and help me to run it smoothly. Thank you! Your user. I WILL GIVE YOU 4 STARS WHEN YOU FIX MY PROBLEM. SO, FOR NOW, ONLY 1 STAR WILL BE GIVEN. ...",1
"The app often does not receive direct messages when they are sent, instead you may only receive someone's direct message when you send them one yourself, even though they may have sent their message hours before. This is a significant issue and it negatively impacts the user experience.",1
"Instagram has been pain the a$$ i mean, before an update my insta was working normal but out of nowhere mostly the reels & videos are not working, even my wifi is working but whatever the video or the reel i play it doesn't play it just stick to one screen but some of the reels play only. I've installed & uninstalled multiple timess but this issue is not resolving please fix this issuee also the amount of glitch is too annoying if this won't be fix real soon i might have to remove this app",1
"Won't let me sign in orsign up on my la Top, ipad, tablet and 2 phones. Even if I use other other emails or other phone number. I've been having this issue for months to almost a whole year. Called up customer service as well and did what they asked and it's all still not working, even with the new updates.",1
Bugstagram !!! Getting worse ‚úåÔ∏è 1.Hopeless Draft which keeps auto deleting. What's the point of drafts? 2.Editing post and not able to compare with original pic? 3.What are the app updates actually for ; Pushing downgrades?? 4. Messages don't even work as expected. Always delayed loading. 5. My phone locks itself when I try to reply to any message from notification. How useful ü§Æ,1
Keeps crashing all of a sudden. Cant even get on ig. Did an update still dont work. Fix the issues surfacing or it will lead to people using another app instead. Update 11/6 still crashes when trying to use app. Uninstall and installed too many times just to log back in smh. Never had issues before now it's worse. I won't change my rating until it's fixed.,1
"My account is not banned but my feed is completely blank since early in the morning. I tried removing the cache and data, changed my password, uninstalled/reinstalled the app and restarted my phone, but nothing works. There's always a loading error! I also posted something this morning but it's gone. What's going on?",1
Is there any glitch in your system because everytime I am choosing a particular audio to be applied on my reel it automatically changes to some other audio. Have tried exiting the app and whatnot but the problem still persist. Now it's getting kinda irritating. Please sort it out.,1
"Hey, Instagram! Can you please stop logging me out from the app? - It's getting really annoying and frustrating everytime you do this! Same with having to change passwords every 1-2 days!!! There is no ""suspicious activity"" going on!!! It's is ME and only ME logging in, which I also always confirm from within the app!!! Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter...",1
The app wont load my story content. I unistalled the app thinking this would solve the problem. Once reinstalled I went to log back in and it asked to send a security code to my number. I've resent the code to my phone multiple times for almost 12 hours and still have never received a message. Now I'm locked out of the app altogether. So sad to see meta going down hill when their applications were once staples for social networking. Please fix these problems!!!,1
"Every time I leave the app unused for an hour, new updates no longer loads in my feed. Also I cannot upload pics as well. I need to reinstall the app if I want to view the latest feed or upload pics. But if left unused for a few minutes or an hour, the glitch resurfaces again. Even when Im done updating, the same glitch happens. Funny coz I dont experience this glitch in IG lite.",1
"The ads have been straight porn lately and it makes me uncomfortable and it's problematic. No one wants to open Instagram to check up on friends and instead see half naked girls on advertised accounts filling their feed. Plus the app glitches when posting more often than not so it's becoming less and less useful and fun,üòêüëé",1
"My account been hacked and I can't get it back, they've changed my email and I can't login. Tried everything on the help center, done the face recognition thing 20 times but nothing. There's no one to call. I've provided info via email that clearly proves account is mine but I'm still asked for codes from authentication app or backup codes, which I have. Could really do with some actual people to help people out instead of rubbish guides that send you round in circles.",1
"Ever since the update, this app has been annoying, who did I offend, everything is glitching. I did a video, and it deleted my song from my video and it is playing the sound from my camera, I've not posted the video, it's in the draft. And now I can't find the original song I used to record the video. What is this? I thought everybody th at was reviewing was just hating on Instagram. But such a big company like meta is So glitchy. Update : Your still glitchy And if it ain't broke done fix it",1
SO BUGGY. When going to edit photos it gets stuck on the first photo no matter which photo you click. If you adjust the size it doesn't stay to where you resized it and adds a big block of grey or black to the edge of the photo. I like that they tried to add more photo resizing options but that's glitchy too.,1
"This app used to be great but lately it has diminished. My main issues are that when I flick down on my feed when it's blank, nothing new comes up; and my inbox is now blank. I unstained the app and installed it again. The issues still remain. My app is all updated. This is unacceptable from Meta.",1
"My account was cloned. It really took too long for anyone to do something about it. My friends, some elderly received scam messages from the person. I'm grateful that they didn't give any of their information out. I never received any updates or acknowledgment that someone was working on the issue. I'm finding social media platforms to be very impersonal.",1
"On and off this year this app has been getting worse. Couldn't share stories from Facebook or to Facebook. Videos freeze up or don't play at all. More and more adds and people I don't know in my feed than actual friends. Fake accounts always sending requests or messages. Now the app doesn't even show up on my android phone, I have to use Chrome just to see my account. Instagram is turned into a joke!!",1
It just gets worse and worse. I don't want suggest posts. I don't want so many adverts. I don't want shopping etc etc. This app has 1bn users. Make it ad and suggested post free for ¬£1 a month. That's a lot of money! And I'd be willing to pay that if the experience was better!,1
"Posting any kind of content has become a literal nightmare. So very defeated by the ever-growing formatting malfunctioning, content not posting, content not being able to be saved, etc. Instagram has become so tremendously defective with bugs. Would appreciate the remedying of these issues very much.",1
"This current app version/update is broken in the sense that if you leave a comment on a post it initially won't show on the app for you at all and to know it actually posted I have to go on to browser to check if it's actually there or not, that shouldn't be happening. I have a very new phone so it's definitely not that & I'm very tech savvy, after i did the new Instagram update it broke quite a few main features. Even viewing tagged photos is broken it goes right back to the start üòÇüòÇüòÇ 0/100!",1
Terrible. Randomly disabling accounts. Refusing to send codes to phones to verify ID so the disabling can be disagreed with. No notice that 10s of thousands of users are affected and that they intend to fix it. No manner to contact them to sort out if ads that have been paid for are now just gone from these randomly disabled accounts. Very fraudulent to accept payment for an ad and then disable the account that paid them.,1
I'm using Instagram a lot and that's why I like to use Web version where I can to answer on messages faster and it's easier to manage my account. Now I cannot login in my account for more than 2 months. I tried to write an email to report this bug but as always Instagram ignored that. I just want to tell that I'm still waiting for the day when the bug on web version will be fixed.,1
"Literally cannot contact customer support. They did a mass suspension of accounts (this is not the first time) and with this round, my account got deleted. It gave me the option to file an appeal but stayed on a loading screen when I was trying to fill out the forms. There is no longer a support email that I'm able to contact regarding the issue, the ""help center"" is attempting to be the only form of assistance they provide. They shouldn't be allowed to delete accounts without warning or reason.",1
"Feed hasn't updated in over a week, and upon reading other reviews I've realised I am not the only one experiencing this problem. Have tried to report via the app twice but seen no change. I know its an Instagram issue and not my device, because my feed is frozen on the same post on both my android phone and Macbook computer. I'm getting tired of seeing the same content every time I log in. I'm on the verge of deleting my account I've had for over 10 years. Very disappointing.",1
"It was good but since the last 4-5 updates it keeps getting worse and worse. They kinda ruin all the algorithms in the search feed section. You get the same posts no matter how many times you reload it for weeks and weeks, It just remains the same and nevers gets changed! That's so Annoying. Facebook and Instagram both have become really bad and annoying for some months.",1
"Uninstalled, then reinstalled to try and fix.... nope. App kept closing when trying to upload posts and reels. Only thing I was able to upload was stories. So I uninstalled and reinstalled and now the app won't even open. How does meta expect people to pay for advertising on there, when the app is so unreliable?",1
"I can't create a story from the main page, why did you make two ""post"" buttons on two separate pages that do different things? I have to go to the profile tab to create a story but you can quickly create a post on the main feed but not stories? This is bad ui - another problem, I can't edit indiv. photos in my carousel. Everytime I click on the photo I want to edit, I only see the first photo of the carousel. This is so bad. Why is it like this?",1
"1. Drafts won't keep all stickers, music, and quiz once saved. 2. Even on a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, I'm having trouble with connection issues via WiFi and features aren't available such as accepting collab request and schedule post. 3. The flag and unread DM feature does not display all messages most times.",1
"I wish I can give zero star. This app is constantly becoming irritating now. Can't even watch anything without glitch and then all of a sudden it stops working. First i thought my phone has some issue but no it was Instagram. What's the point of adding so many features, when you can't use it properly due to glitches.. Please rectify these glitches or bugs.",1
Instagram is such a rubbish app. Every day.. literally EVERY SINGLE DAY there's a new glitch either I cannot slide reply to messages or it's isn't showing music option to add in stories. If you can't keep your users happy what else do you expect from them? It has become more a market place than a photo sharing app. Request to the developers to look into it or else Instagram will be in place like Twitter is in.,1
I love instagram until it started trying to be TicTok. Also recently something changed so when I go to upload a photo it only shows me previous instagram photos rather then my whole camera reel. When I go to access my camera there is no longer an option for multiple photos. very unimpressed with app currently. Now reels are a thing but I've been trying to upload one for 24hrs and tried multiple times to stop and start fresh.,1
I don't know what is wrong with you Instagram. If I'm opening my search page there's only some scenic pictures are coming and reels are also not being played. My search page is not coming according to my preference. What is wrong with you. Just tell plzzz otherwise I have no option rather than uninstalling it. If you can than look after it plzzz.,1
"Scrolling past the stupid things to look at pictures I actually want to see counts as me watching them. The algorithm sucks. Edit: Almost two years later, the algorithm still sucks. Maybe even sucks more than before. The content I actively seek out and spend hours looking at shows up NOWHERE on my suggested feed, and it doesn't matter how many times I click not interested on the same topic, it's still ALL I see. PLEASE let us choose our own topics if the algorithm is gonna fail so spectacularly",1
"Why is this social media app still stands with its popularity even though it is such a worst app with full of bugs? ü§¶ Always it stucks in the middle when I'm watching a reel or video. üò° On an attempt to refresh the feed, it won't work and the loading circle at the top rotates and rotates and rotates...untill I close the app being frustrated. ü§¨ Giving one star also not worth for this app. üëæ üîö",1
"I had 127 followers and all of a sudden it's showing that I have only 1 follower. I've asked those people but they didn't do anything. It's the fault of Instagram management, kindly fix it immediately. There's an another issue, previously I've told that I'm not be able to select a particular message and can't send reply of that particular selected message. Kindly help me to get the eligibility to give reply of a particular selected message too.",1
I loved this app until I was hacked. I have tried multiple times to regain access to my account including sending my video selfie. I have not received any email back in the stated time frame given from my submission. Since then I have now received another notification that my email and phone number have been changed through that account. There is NO ONE to privately contact to deal with this matter. I am absolutely appalled from someone that works in customer service themselves.,1
"So many bugs, broken reels, comments, muted stories showing, notifications mess, likes disappear! Worst with every update, typical fb trend, it's sad. This should change the name to buggram! Absolutely flooded with intrusive ads! Forcing adverts sound on regardless of my settings and lack of them in detail for years! So unprofessional and intrusive! Now playing with forcing the phone permissions when trying post story, this is bad!!",1
"Update 12/2022: app still sucks. App is getting worse every time. So many ads. No data-saving option to not autoplay videos. Even with data saver activated, videos are preloaded and play. Plus notification settings are broken, because I still get alerts on stories when I've set them to silent.",1
"Opens up to a post you are interested in and suddenly before you could finish, pulls that down below 700 post you skip through to find the one this unorganized app opened to. Either open up and stick to it or refresh when user does so, no one is interested in an app where it does what it wants and not what user does. Dirty tactics or good user experience it's devepopers call.",1
"What the Hell...Every snice Instagram had a network account malfunction last week, the app is not working or functioning properly??? I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app numerous times and still no joy in being able to log in. When the app decides to log me in, it takes over 20 minutes for my profile to open, sometimes it doesn't even open at all. It's been more than 7 days and still the app is not working today???? What the fudge man! Zuckerberg, Sort the algorithm & issues out already!",1
"Mediocre at best. People think it's a dating site. If you find something you want to see, good luck keeping it on your screen. It refreshes so much I lose things I want to see all the time. Touch something and you go somewhere else. Good luck finding that thing again. Twitchy interfaces are never good.",1
"Even after refreshing the feed I'm seeing the same 7 days old posts and it says you're all caught up. Only stories, messages, Reels and explore are being updated but not the home feed posts. Manually checking other accounts show new posts (3 hours ago, 2 days ago etc). I've tried clearing cache, reinstalling latest IG, restarting phone, logging in on PC, same story. I've reported this through the app many times but it has still not been fixed. Please fix this. Thanks",1
"notifications have always been faulty on every phone i have /: i still don't have the themes for dms either. bots are a big problem, the following and favourites tabs don't always work, and the pushing of reels and shopping is off-putting. my dms randomly don't show me messages both someone else and i have just sent. overall, the app is now terrible.",1
"2 hours on average to upload a reel. The glitches in the reels are unbelievable!! 15 times I posed and deleted 1 reel because each time there was a new glitch. Sound, text, timing is all off. I don't think I have ever uploaded a reel without there being a problem üòµ‚Äçüí´",1
Changes to the app make it that I only see posts from companies I follow or ads. I have to scroll through 30-40 posts to find something that a friend or family member posted. Either the app is dying and nobody is posting anymore or they are trying to monetize every aspect of it but the new app sucks. Update: I didn't think the app could get worse but it did. Most of the posts on my timeline are for pages I don't follow. It seems like they are forcing reels down my throat. Terrible app now,1
"I already gave a complaint but I don't get any response from Instagram. My account is facing a lot of troubles nowadays. The DM option is messing up repeatedly. The reply, reaction and theme options are not working for the past three weeks. It shows sometimes and gone sometimes. It really irritates a lot. I already gave a complaint about the notes options. Till I don't get any response from you. Fix this soon.",1
"Very much disappointed! Earlier it was good but since few months some of the features aren't working at all such as ""reply a message"" and changing Theme. The ""report a problem"" and ""something isn't working"" options are just useless as I complained 1000s of times but nothing happened. Hoping for the betterment.",1
"I'm getting daily irritating by using this app evry time I've to refresh the feed by myself after entering the app as I'm increasing the volume to hear the reel or any other video the video get stucked & as I'm clicking the mute option video or reel starts playing in mute mode üò† so how would I hear the videos every time there's a bug in this application.... Too many problems only unnecessary functions are being added, what's the use of notes BTW.... üò†üò†üò†",1
"The feed issue came back. Would not show me anything past 3 days ago. I thought it was an app issue so I cleared the cache and uninstalled. When I reinstalled, it wouldn't take my password. i know it's right cause I logged in the desktop version just fine. Then it keeps sending me the same 2FA code so it's always expired. Essential, I'm now locked out of the app..... thanks a lot Instagram....",1
Facing issues in Instagram reels from a few days. I am uploading perfect ratio size of 9:16 and video is play properly and perfectly in preview selection but after uploading something happens to it. Its not play properly and its size reduces. I don't know why this happening. Please fix this issue. I want to post videos but do to this issue and bugs i am unable to post,1
"I've been on this app for a very long time, but however lately I've been having a lot of issues. I see ads more than the people I follow, I don't get messages on time(next 2 days before it appears), I don't have a lot of features even simple as 1 minute stories. Just a whole lot of mess. I have over 1k follow and Instagram algorithm only shows 22 people my post and everyday I log on it's a notification about paying for boost.",1
It Randomly logged me out and I can't log in anymore.. Tried many times but it won't.. every time a message pops up saying username doesn't refer to an account or smth like that also an error messages saying try again after a few minutes .. I've Deleted the app and reinstalled it more than once but clearly the app deleted my account from it's own I guess !! I don't know what to do it's frustrating and annoying,1
Insta tik tok. Trying to be something it's not. The reels aren't easy to do. Music clips are 15 seconds and too short. Still pics even with 1000 followers do good to get 20 likes on a good day. No way to see specifically who you follow that doesn't follow you back.,1
"Reels are now paused and muted unless I click on them. You're the largest social media company on the planet. Why can't I choose how I want to view my content? Also the feed randomly refreshes every few minutes, and don't even think about leaving the app. All the issues I have with this app have been here for years because no one developing this app actually cares or wants it to function better.",1
"So many glitches lately. I'm not even able to make a post. I haven't been able to post a story in months because the pictures are always corrupted, turning into just a bunch of verticle lines. Issues keep piling on. Time to do something about it please, Instagram!",1
"I had saved some reels audios to use later now I'm opening the saved section where the audios were kept but it's nothing... at first i thought it's network issue but it's not all my other apps, reels evrything r going good it won't be functioning if it was network issue so it's not network issue so Why the audios r not coming... what the hell is happening",1
More annoying with each update. I have had a food collection for years now and now it won't load more than a few posts. I literally have 100s of recipes and I can't access more than a few. Not to mention the reels become so laggy in playing recently too. You guys have absolutely ruined what used to be a decent app!,1
"I do understand that free apps are funded by displaying Ads, however I am seeing huge number of Ads, it is showing like after 2 ‚Äì 3 posts. Even though that I do hide the Ads, it shows another add from the same advertiser, so I had to block those advertisers accounts. Instagram is becoming more a classifieds app than a photos/videos story share app..",1
"I used to use this app alot on my old phone but since upgrading, the app will not start at all. It gets to the Instagram logo whilst starting but thats it and the pretty much freezes my device until I eventually manage to close it. I have tried updating, re-installing, force stopping and clearing both the cache and user data but to no avail.",1
"1st of all, this is the only social media app I use. Then no matter how many times I try ND update it doesn't work. Day before yesterday I got a sudden notification telling me that your insta is updated. Now that I am try to add music to my post, I am back to square one. No option coming. I am so messed. Not being able to do nay of the cool things on insta others are doing. I have literally reinstalled my app after deleting it 5 times. Nothing works",1
I just fed up with this apps chat settings. It is not updating properly. The option for swipe reply on a message is not working. I used to update it from playstore all the time but it seems to be appear that it is not properly get updated. The customer care service for this app is also not appropriate.,1
"In this Instagram, since I updated the application 3 years ago, only English piano songs are coming in the music song and after that all the language songs are not coming. And updated many times but the language of the song does not appear in the music.",1
"Optimization is becoming worse and worse, update by update. Issues are stacking and fixes aren't fixes at all. Needs so much work to be considered a good app. Edit: Got even worse. Posting a couple of photos has become a full time job effort.",1
When I trying to comment on other people's post and see what I'm trying to type it doesn't show up you guys have too many problems. Also when I'm on Instagram for at least a good minute it starts lagging so much that I actually have to refresh the app itself. when are you guys going to fix the issue and now when I watch other people's videos it just sends them on repeat,1
I'm sure I'm not the only one having reel problems... Every time I select a video reel an entirely different video reel plays. Tap on another video and the same incorrect video plays. My app is up to date on all devices it is definitely a bug.,1
"Thanks for removing more app features. Being told what to see is becoming tiresome. Bring back sort by recent in the hashtags. Bad enough it was removed as a feature in the feed. When I log in, I want to know what's happening in the world today, not what some computer generated algorithm thinks is the best post. Sorting by ""Top"" shows me posts from months, sometimes years ago which is of no interest to me. You should be adding features to improve the user's experience, not removing them.",1
"I am not able to add music to my posts. I checked in multiple devices if it's available in their phones, to my surprise they were able to. I think it's some glitche in the recent update I did. Would request you to fix this issue ASAP.",1
"Haven't been receiving any notifications for days, people message me and no notification whatsoever shows. I already uninstalled and installed and restarted the phone, nothing works. All notification options in the app and on the device settings are enabled for Instagram, makes no difference whatsoever.",1
"It is so unfair and Stupidity of your system that it allows to add the music to a reels and when you publish the same it doesnt play the music saying that the music is not allowed in your region,this is so annoying after taking more than 30mins to create a proper reels with good Music which plays such good vibe with th pics... Plzz dont waste time of others, and take off the music which is not allowed for the region and show up only which can be used for our region to create a better reel..",1
"I can't use audio reels video because save audio and use audio option are not showing in so many videos. I reported too many times.If a show is happening in some, then the song gets deleted after saving it in the draft. If I search any song, it says not found. Please check your system.",1
"Can't even see past my keyboard when I reply in reels. Latest android. What did you change? Also videos only ever upload from the start, despite the clip I selected with ""trim"". I have to first use another editing app because Instagram's doesn't work.",1
"Every time I add icons to my stories or try to draw, it always has bugs that makes them discolored. Very disappointing. Update: This app can't send messages properly as well and every time I try to open my account to other devices, my username can't be found. Meta must improve.",1
Good app but cant seem to reply to another person with messages. Tried enabling the option but the option is not available in settings. ___ Edit: Well after a long time of usage i have decreased my rating to 2 stars. At first it wasn't too much but now its getting obnoxious. I have tried upgrading my messaging to messenger but nothing works. Due to this I have so many less features which of course others have and I dont making things awkward. I will change these ratings once the issue is fixed.,1
"While logging in, Feeds are automatically refreshing and doesn't appear again.. Contains many ads than earlier especially in stories.. Feeds are often filled with suggested post, because you liked, sponsored.. Can't see the posts from the page that I follow.. Nowadays it's very irritating to use insta.. Sometimes I doubt that I am using an official app or any third rated app..",1
"Randomly deleted my account that I had for 4 years for absolutely no reason. That was December of 2021. Now every I can't open my own or other's stories, the icon just turns black. I can't view archived stories, can't see comments on posts, and I constantly have to close the app the send or view messages.",1
Very frustrated. I've been having issues for a few weeks now. My feed does not show me anything recent only stuff from days or a week ago. I tried reporting the issue twice and nothing. I logged out and logged back in. I Uninstalled and reinstalled it. I even checked if it was updated. Nothing had worked.,1
"Hello IG dev Team, I don't have the message disappearing option turned on, yet I observe that many messages disappear on their own. Some messages are disappearing before they are read, which is quite aggravating. Any message eventually vanishes. I need your help to solve my ID issue, otherwise I'll stop using Instagram. Read it again. Thanks!",1
"Always bugs & glitches. The latest: Posting a story & it crashed 3 times, posting a 3-photo post, and it just wouldnt 'finish'. Also just tried editing photos on a multiple photo post. The editor wouldn't let me edit past the first photo. Just all too hard.",1
"The app video recording Lags after 30s when recording stories, up to the point it's unusable to record after the 30s mark. It's like the frame rate drops after the 30s mark. However, when the video was later posted, the low frame rate video that was recorded looks fine.",1
"We live in an Era where my phone can automatically notify me when I have duplicate files on my device. My phone can remaster a picture by itself using context to: center the photo on the subject, sharpen the image, brighten the image, and reduce blur after the fact with A.I. My phone can remember how the photo was to undo all of my edits; a year after the photo was taken. We live in a marvelous age such as this and yet a PHOTO app doesn't have the coding to properly layout a PHOTO for itself.",1
"I didn't have the notes features for week ,when everyone else has got it , i didnt have the primary/general things on my main Instagram account but i have it on my second account which is weird , FIX THIS PROBLEM. How can only one account have the features it is so annoying , i wanted to give zero rating but i can't so im giving one . Fix this issue , i cant save my picture or it will turn out to be a video static of picture , i cant do notes or seperate my chats . FIX THIS PROBLEM",1
"Can't use voice recorder. Not working. Can't slide message to respond. I just want them to be fixed. Now, new problem, showing ""unable to load images"", when I try to post. It's been a week since I'm facing this problem.",1
"Just keeps getting worse. I really don't understand what Instagram is doing. I'm down to handing out 1 star. So many issues, but my biggest one these days is my Drafts don't save for even 24 hours. I have done test drafts, and sometimes they last up to 3 days! But ones I actually work on, disappear from Drafts option within 24 hours. Terrible. I get Instagram hates photography, but seriously! New: #hashtags I follow have completely disappeared from Following. Instagram, I hate you.",1
"WORST UPDATE EVER !!!. I can't find drawing option which i always use to doodle. And whenever I'm making a video call with my Bluetooth headset on, the screen is getting blank and i can see nothing until the other person ends the call. Kindly resolve this bug.",1
I have reported the problem so many times that MY INSTAGRAM IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY! but literally nothing happened. I'm not able to react to messages nor tag them for a reply! My account works like a vintage account. Refreshing home page doesn't work properly when I refresh it shows older posts. I'm not able to costumize the chats. It's really frustrating. Please do something and make it work properly!,1
It's used to be good. But nowadays it's full of bug and glitch. The translator didn't work. Even when i try to post something or try to share an story I can't see how it looking before posting. And the picture became bad after posting. It's like change it shape. Fix them allüôÅ,1
"I notice this app is giving me a problem with my notifications, it would pop up but when I enter the app there is nothing and I keep refreshing and still is the same. Also the app setting its very hard to understand. I had a hard time finding just to delete an old profile of mine.",1
"This is a horrible user experience, the interface and filters change too much for no reason between stories and posts, it's a nightmare selecting pictures, back button often throw away everything you have done, you can't select proper formats for pictures multi pictures posts of different sizes, wide angle pictures get shrunk and weird, the volume controls and tagging clicking on the stories is often buggy n unclickable.",1
I have been trying to activate my instagram account in a different phone but it is glitching a lot and constantly saying that this username does not exist. It is doing the same when I'm trying to enter the phone number or email or even trying to open it from facebook. It is not opening at all and constantly showing that it does not exist evn though I'm writing it correctly. Please address to this matter ASAP.,1
"I've blocked way more people than I follow with these stupid reels. Once you like a single post it will assume you love that topic and it's extremely difficult to undo that. It should just ask what topics you like and dislike, as a result I never like anything. The ads are very invasive too. The save post button is now very hidden as well, basically you have to do 3 things to get to it instead of 1, please put it back!",1
"This is a never seen before new issue. After just a little while of using the app, it disconnects my phones wifi and starts working with cellular data. Have uninstalled and reinstalled again and again with no work around. Strangest thing I have ever seen.",1
"Sooooooo buggy. Some random account claimed my reel audio as their own (it's original audio of me talking), and I can't remove it from their audio page no matter how many times I tell the app to remove it. Trying to file a bug report gets me a ""can't create a bug report right now"" error. Atrocious.",1
"Several updates & reinstallations even now if I upload more than 1 story a day, I cannot view the 2nd (or 3rd, or 4th so on and so forth) story unless I logout from the account and log back in. EDIT: now the app has been crashing for 2 weeks, randomly, especially. when watching stories. It'll freeze and then crash.",1
Full of bugs and glitches. Their help center is the worst why is it named help center if they're not providing any help. I've been facing numberous glitches and bugs on account for the past year i even reported about it but no response. This app literally has the worst help center/coustomer service. If i had an alternate option i would've switched to it months ago.,1
"This app is broken. Every couple of months I get hit with some kind of app-breaking bug. Currently on neither of my phones does the app work at all. I can get notifications and that's it. Nothing loads when I go onto the app, everyone's pfp is white, and messages aren't updating. And i AM NOT BANNED as I can use it in a browser. Jesus christ just do your jobs at least mediocre and this isn't a problem.",1
"Has suddenly stopped allowing me to approve my limited comments. Also can't switch from ""top comments"" to ""newest first"". When I go to my grid view the top icons completely disappear meaning I can't do literally anything, and refreshing doesn't restore them. I left FB two yrs ago because that became a steaming pile of doodoo and this is going the same way. Incredibly frustrating.",1
The recent update is so full of bugs. Can't see the new posts and updates of friends. Only reels from 14 days back are being shown in the feed when people are constantly posting. Tried installing the app again or clear cache. Nothing worked. I hope you clear this out quickly.,1
"Extremely disappointing experience. I tried to refresh my feed multiple times but it won't happen. The Instagram team I assume will ignore me like they are doing to everyone else. Edit: recently the ads in my feed have also been getting really unacceptable. Photos of naked women have been recurrent. I've tried to report those but to no avail. I expect no response from your team,but if this degeneracy isn't fixed I will stop using Instagram.",1
"What happened suddenly! My Instagram is literally not working as before means takes time load new posts ,not able download anything,not able to view my own post properly,not able use filters,allover not able to use Instagram at all .Want to know why is this happening I also updated the app but the problem is same. Very disappointing. A humble request to please fix this ...... Only this problem is affecting my ratings to this app... Thank you",1
"Instagram, when you need people to update your app, and we do, because when that happens the app doesn't work when it's not updated, and when we do update it, it doesn't work. Why does this keep happening. I want to keep this app for so many reasons. I'm tired of this happening. It's annoying. First, I'm not able to comment on certain posts because when I click to type a comment the bar that shows what I'm typing doesn't show and now when I click on a post, it sends me to Google.",1
Terrible Login System - I have the same mobile number registered to two different pages. It lets me log into one but not the other and password resets and face verification don't work. No human support available and no human verification. If someone could look at my account they would be able to fix it easily. The account in question is my portfolio website so it's a big loss that I can't regain access to my account. Really disappointing.,1
It seems like every update makes everything worse I quite enjoyed the reels and the ability to save it to a collection on my Instagram account but now there's no longer that option. They fixed it but now I can't reply to specific messages.,1
"Suddenly the app requires a mobile number and refuses to work. It doesn't accept my Finnish number and defaults to a German prefix. So, ultimately I can't use the app. The feed turned into a bizzare mix of soft-porn and poorly targeted advertising, there is little left of the original Instagram. Too bad I can't even close my account.",1
"This is soo annoying. I don't really know what to say... there are so many glitches in this app , nothing is working properly. The main problem I am facing about the app is that the app is working like the old version of Instagram l updated it so many times but after few hours it looks same as before. this happens again and again and I also reinstalled it but the problem is out of control . I am very disappointed with it . Please fix that problem as soon as possible .",1
"Tried to post multiple pictures and videos but was stopped repeatedly by the app saying it couldn't post the picture. The picture and text is then deleted, not saved anywhere, do you have to create it all again and repost, hoping it works the next time. It frequently doesn't.",1
In my Instagram app their is swipe message option problem. Actually it didn't work from the very beginning when i installed this app. I had tried many ways to solve this problem even reported it many times but it didn't work and i don't know why they have created this report problem option when they are not going to respond or solve aur issue.,1
"So many bugs, the message notification comes late even if you have seen the message the notification will comes late. If the notification comes we can't see the message and sometimes if doesn't show the messages at all. Once it was a wonderful app but now it's a disaster.",1
"Absolute trash. Crashes constantly, isn't even a photo app anymore, and currently can't even look at hashtags by recent order, because all that matters is ""Top"" and reels apparently. From the bottom of my heart I hope this app permanently disappears from the internet soon, it was best around 2017-2018 and then went downhill trying to become tiktok.",1
"Worst app in Social. One of my Instagram account is showing ""Couldn't refresh feed"" and white or black screen after loading, & in web browser ""Confirm your information using the Instagram app to try to get back to your account"" on login without any reason. I try other smartphones to login but it doesn't work. I'm facing this problem from last 13 months almost. So not recommended to anyone .",1
"Genuinely awful app, to be owned by meta and yet with multiple intrusive bugs constantly vying with my will to use this app, some have been around for months and still aren't fixed, the app will just decide not to send my messages for hours and then send them all?? Or when I can open videos sent to me no matter what I do, fix your app.",1
"App has been buggy for about over a month now my feed won't refresh, I can't view stories or reels, and most of my messages don't even send. I know other people are also having these problems so the problem is obviously with the app itself been waiting to see if they fix it but not even messaging the official Instagram account hasn't worked",1
The new update is full of bugs.If i select some reels instead of that i'm getting some other reels.Also there is no continuity in reels.I am getting some random suggestions. Everything is getting repeated.Instead of going for more features like notes it would be really nice if you cod checkout this bugging issue.Watching reels in this social platform have become super annoying üòí,1
"It is so obnoxious how the big apps don't bother to have a functional interface. Stories and notifications never load or redirect properly, and links just flat out don't work. It's like something a student might cobble together. Absolute trash.",1
"I downloaded a new update and if I want to share several photos in a rectangle, Instagram cuts them to square every time, even if I save them as drafts. It wasn't like that before. I tried on another phone and the same thing happens. Please change it!!!",1
"So buggy. It will start playing audio from a video and I can't get it to stop even after I leave that page, and another video's audio could even start playing. Closing the app doesn't even work. Only way I've found is restarting my phone!..",1
"Why this app suddenly stops working like I'm scrolling randomly, or going through stories then suddenly it would hang and after few secs an error would pop up saying Instagram is not responding. Wth bruh!! Can't even say that it's bcoz of my phone cuz all other apps are working just fine! Not to mention a lot of time has already passed since it started to happen!!!",1
My instagram feed is not getting refreshed. Im getting the same posts over and over. Stories are getting refreshed. I have 7GB data as well. I have reinstalled the app and tried every setting in my mobile as well. Contacted my network service provider as well. I think its an issue with Instagram. Please fix it asap to avoid spoiling user experience.,1
"I've had my account for several years. Today it's locked me out of everything and asked for a mobile number confirmation, I gave it my number, recieved the code and entered it, but it just stayed on loading, with absolutely nothing happening. I've tried attempt after attempt and the app is now making me wait to do it again, I've been waiting for two hours and it still refuses to let me try again. There has been no support from the Instagram team, and no solution found for this issue. PLEASE HELP",1
"The past week I keep getting shown the same 3 posts from pages im following in my news feed then it says I'm all caught up and just shows me suggested pages/posts I've tried to reinstall the app, I've reported it, I've tried to hide the 3 posts in hopes it would refresh, basically the only new content I'm getting from the pages I follow are through story's at the moment or go directly to a pages profile to see any new posts, please fix this",1
"Welp! This app is completely junk now. Everything...I mean everything o see is sponsored or and add. Worthless app. Yes, I have tried all the methods to hide or report, blah blah blah blah. Too many ads to sort though. I'd never get to see what I really want after spending all day trying to avoid apps.",1
"Why do you need access to my device's location for me to type in the location myself on posts. Additionally would prefer to only be shown content from folks I follow, my feed is full of useless ""suggestions""... Now you're not even letting me sign in on the app. Just told error. Good riddance I suppose.",1
Kicked out of my account for God knows what reason and Instagram will not send me the confirmation code OTP thing so that I can access my account again. I keep pressing the resend code button and nothing happens and nothing has been happening. Idk if I'll ever be able to get into my account again üôÑ maybe this is my sign to finally uninstall this dying app,1
"I am constantly amazed by the app's inability to function properly. The more Instagram tries to be like other apps, the less their own features work. It's really quite sad. The algorithms are garbage, there's no order whatsoever, the settings don't work, filters keep disappearing, and the basic functionality of photo editing/posting, no, the entire app has become practically non-existent ever since they have pathetically tried to copy TikTok. Edit: Just like Facebook, the ads are getting worse.",1
"Firstly, it gives the feature of writing and sharing notes for many weeks and as soon as you use this feature then they unavailable this feature for you only. Many times try to contact with support team but they don't reply.",1
"This app is awful. I start scrolling down to look at my feed when Instagram suddenly decides to go back to the top, forcing me to look at other posts and never finding the post I was looking at in the first place. When this happens I stop using it for the day. Sort it out before I move on. Thank you üôè",1
"Worst app ever, doesn't even run properly, not sending messages, not getting features about reacting messages till now, even not getting features of notes, I can't get updates of messages, only old messages i can seen.even not solved problem, worst app ever.",1
"Low effort posts in the form of screenshots of old tweets posted as reels. Even if I can be bothered to read it, a ""watch again"" message pops up before I can finish reading. Seriously, what is the point of this? Garbage.",1
"Pay to play app made worse by constant reel suggestions for accounts I don't follow or have an interest in. Also my ads are completely scuffed now and suggest completely random topics which now take up another 20-33% of my feed, when I try to adjust my ad settings to combat this I'm with an absolute mess of topics, themes and concepts so I guess I'm stuck with my feed being stuck with Turkish dental surgery now. I'm glad that Meta is dying.",1
"My account got suspended without any reason and now I am unable to retrieve that. Not able to contact customer care or anything. Very poor from Instagram. Have a account more than 5 years, It takes lot to build a profile but it deactivated in a minute. Please fix this issue ASAP.",1
"Nice app... but recently many accounts are getting hacked... My 6-7 friends recently lost their account as they got hacked... The problem is not about the account but there privacy is also getting disturbed due to this.. I hope u will resolve the issue very soon or very soon you will see a lot of people, deactivating their account and deleting the Instagram application..",1
"Sometimes an upload fails and there's absolutely no way for me to recover my long captions and I have to stress to try to remember them. Most times, I fail to make the post as good as the initial failed one. Please do something about it. Thanks Update! A new issue has arisen. I have been installing the app for some time and I can't find the reel upload function. It's simply not there.",1
"Broken app. Black screen, can't access account. Their support told me to create a new account and that they SHOULD be able to retrieve low res copies of MOST of my pics. Years of travel pics, life updates, memories and comments essentially inaccessible because my account had the 'suspicious activity' of being inactive for a period of time then having one 'suspicious' log in (for a giveaway). Honestly, almost glad I have an excuse to leave. Social media is a failed experiment",1
"Anytime I post anything on my story, the text appears but the photo itself just shows a black screen, i've updated the app, i've force stopped it, and i've deleted and reinstalled it, nothing works!",1
"Uploading Photos is a nightmare in this app, if you exit the app, your selected photos are gone, if your turn off the screen for a few seconds, its gone, & the saved option doesn't open most of the times & when you try to save a post it takes forever for the folders to open or sometimes it won't open at all.",1
"Something is wrong with my app. Everytime I send a voice note, it doesn't work. The minute counter shows 0:00. I can listen to my voice again but the other side can't listen to it. What happened??",1
"I'm very upset with the fact that I tried multiple times to uninstall and install and try to fix and even write complain about it that there are many songs on my reels and story are unavailable. How to fix this, please help as soon as possible.",1
"Incredibly buggy mess of an app. Constantly refreshes the feed when you're trying to look at a post and will freeze on a black screen forcing a restart, happens multiple times a day.",1
I miss chronological order. It's totally off putting to open the app to see photos from a week ago but not the new stuff. Also photos are being shifted after I publish. It's impossible to centre multiple photos and have them stay centred until they are published.,1
"I gave it a star cause it's getting really bad..I can't watch videos/reels they keep on hanging. I got off the app and came back in but was still same.. and the problem is not my phone so it's gotta be Instagram's problem.. it's still not better, I feel like you guys haven't even checked it out, the vids don't play, they just hang the whole time",1
"What the hell????? Nothing works... Links either don't open or redirect you to random posts There is no sync between visuals and audio AND the files glitch, at some point, or get corrupted.",1
"Why I keep getting Non-vegetarian cooking reels. I am vegan and it makes me very uncomfortable to go through this videos while scrolling. Can that be fixed or should I stop using Instagram? Every 10th reel is about a non-vegetarian cooking reel. I kept clicking on ""This topic doesn't interest me"" or ""This makes me uncomfortable"" nothing changes. Please fix it, Let us choose what we want to see.",1
Its irritating to use! I couldn't post reels... and I couldn't use new features such as notes... eventhough I update it and reinstall multiple times! Right now I couldn't even send voice messages please do give me an answer and help me out!,1
The message doesn't appear even my page didnt showed up any post? It's tiring to keep login to my account again & again whenever i want to use it. Theres no problem on my wifi connection but it still loading forever.Others also experienced the same thing so pls fix this as soon as possible.,1
"Whenever I Install Instagram and try to Open it,it does not open it just show that it's opening and then it comes back to home screen and shows that 'Instagram Keeps Stopping' I have tried every single trick to get rid of this issue but it doesn't.",1
"Not able to see the reels in DMs. It shows black screen. If i scroll down new reel would appear and run easily, but the reel that i received in the DM couldn't open. Please fix this..it irritates a lot.",1
"The new update is really bad. They killed the DM feature. Can't DM anyone. Have to go all the way to chats, search a person, to do it. Its unnecessarily annoying. Revert it! Even search is buggy, on discover and for tagging feature.",1
"After opening the app, it gets stuck. It runs the video for 8 - 10 seconds and then nothing is loaded. Can't see any stories or post. Refresh doesn't work too.",1
"I open the app, I start to check out the first post I see then the app hides the post, saying ""you're all caught up"" except I didn't even get a chance to check out the post. ""Show older posts"" doesn't show the most recent post. This is frustrating.",1
"There are lot of bugs, 1. The message always gives a pop up even though we have opened it. 2. Unable to refresh , and it wont happen whatever we do. 3. Followers are getting reduced dont know why.",1
"Can't login. It can't find my username in it's own stupid database. Then when I click trouble logging in, it asks me to give username and then tells me to try again later, everytime. All this while, the account is perfectly accessible through browser. Unusable trash app.",1
Everything about reels is awful and IG doesnt care about photo content anymore. I've had to repost the same reel over 5 times to get them to be exactly how I edited them. Drafts go missing. Draft errors happen constantly. If I edit them somewhere else IG won't push my content. Absolute BS. I might have to move over to TikTok and forget about this platform.....,1
I am giving it one star because it has many problems from yesterday I am trying to open my account instead it is showing me a white blank screen . I deleted many things from my phn so to increase the storage but it didn't work. I uninstalled and reinstalled it but it didn't work . Otherwise it is a very good app Please it is my humble request to fix this problem üíî,1
"Please fix your account suggestions button, I have it off, and it still nonstop tells me ""you might know this person"" suggesting I follow them, I'm not going to follow a friend of a friends parents. Why would I? I'm not following people I don't know. I'm not following accounts that don't interest me to see regularly. Please, fix the problem, it's annoying, and the extra notifications that aren't supposed to be on in the first place are annoying.",1
"Its now Nov 2022 and still getting a blank black screen. .... July 2022 Acting up. It just says loading. Been saying this for days. Can't post, or see anything. I've restart my phone. I've un installed and re installed. Nothing! And to top it off nobody's responded to my help email Update * now I can't post comments or even a caption on my own page!! It says we restrict certain content... what content? A smiley ‚ò∫ wth",1
The app is improved and they have brought great changes to it like to make it the best app. In the start I have faced alot of problems like the compromising of account but everything is fine now. But I'll request to Instagram that please don't compromise my account again.,1
"I started using 2FA and Instagram gave me some backup codes to use in case I can't access my account. After resetting my phone I tried those codes to login but none of them are worked. I tried to contact support, sent a video for recognition, no reply. It looks like my is gone. Why the hell backup codes are changing, and why don't you warn me about it in the first place? This is ridiculous, just as I expect from Meta.",1
"Used to be so fun. I can't even change by bio right now it's so glitchy and over run with bots. So tired of seeing half naked women, too. Near pornography is always the first thing on my feed these days. I can't handle this place anymore it's so twisted and buggy. I hope you all stay far away from Instagram. God speed.",1
"A bug appears when I try to make a Story: If I change the app while I'm making the Story, the picture I chose in background disappears, just the text I wrote keeps... Sometimes everything dissapear. In conclusion, I have to make my story over and over again to finally upload it...",1
"This app keeps getting worse ): but I'm here to complain I can't select to post more than one picture without it saying ""cant continue editing"" and all I see on my feed is reels. I do miss the option to just see photo post.",1
"The only reason I use Instagram is to post pictures on my hobby page (modelling, painting) , to advertise what I can do. My last posts haven't appeared in ANY of the tagged # groups, meaning they aren't seen by anyone not following me already, making it impossible to build. I've sent a report twice about this and not even got an automated response, let alone an actual resolution. In the vain hope someone can extract my page from the black hole it's fallen into, I'm writing this",1
Disgusting I am very disappointed with you Instagram why music is not working in my I'd. Whenever I want to see any of your reels or insta story it shows music is not working in your region and I'm very upset about it. Please do something. I'm using Instagram since 2018. Its a request please fix this problem soon üôèüèª. Thank you,1
"Hi. After the most recent update, I (and others) started getting push notifications for EVERY single ""like"" for comments, including from those I do not follow. Nothing in Settings has made this stop & it's super annoying. Plz restore the setting where users only got notified of comment likes from people they follow.",1
"I don't get the notifications from the people I've asked for notifications from, so I miss lots of posts as my timeline and stories hardly ever refresh. It's now 15/11 and I'm still being shown posts from Halloween! Totally useless app, when it used to be good.",1
This currently Instagram algorithm systems is messing up user experience... Especially when Instagram accuses me of sharing my password to external automations to gain followers thereby limiting my account almost everyday and prompting me to change my compatible password everyday. So now I have lost my one account after forgetting the latest password I was forced to adopt! Too bad! üíîüíîüíî,1
"Explore Page is Trash. I see the same posts repeated in my normal feed for multiple days, and then I go to explore and it's a bunch of nature photos, architecture, and random memes from India and I have no clue why as I don't interact with anything like this.",1
It used to be easy to gain access to my account but now yesterday i accidentally logged out of my account and am unable to login. I cant gain access to the phone number that was registered as it has now stopped working (the phone number). Also in my profile i didnt uploaded any photo of myself so either way i cant access it now. Very dissatisfied üëé pls help resolve this issue,1
"This app glitches frequently, particularly when I am posting. It will change my pictures on me or twist them weird and post them that way even after double checking or fixing it. This has been happening for several years with no fixes yet!!",1
"This app is getting worse day by day. After every update, I have to face so many bugs and glitches in my content page. Sometimes videos don't get uploaded and sometimes this app kicks me out of it suddenly. I'm sick of it now",1
"My personal and business account has been hacked, I submitted a selfie video for both and only my personal account was approved because the business account hardly has photos of myself. I have been paying for ads for the business account and yet they cannot use that information confirm that I own it and although they approved the personal account I still cannot log in. It's easy for hackers too access our accounts and very difficult for us to retrieve them. Instagram do better.",1
"Frustrated from the latest updates, they do not improve the apps but it makes in more lag full.... I send any text to someone it gets disappeared from my screen even if it gets delivered but the main point is we don't get any output of our reports and problems the management team is just a 0 and are Makin this app a 0",1
"they managed to make posting photos the most insufferable experience. doesn't save drafts, crops weird and glitches after posting (even after specifically cropping under the adjustments of an individual photo)... they had one job",1
Disgusting app. Constantly glitching and crashing. Add yours filter/story feature never works. App gets worse and worse with every update. The last time this app didn't have a bug was in the 2000s.,1
Refuses to let me upload photos to my reels after trying to choose the audio. Just keeps trying to load and no matter how much I restart the app it doesn't fix.,1
"Horrible. If I can give negative stars, I would. Recovery method is useless. Hackers has their email and phone number saved in my instagram so sending the hackers the recovery pin is stupid. No other way besides picture in my profile, which i have but theyre still unable to verify it's me. Ridiculous. No live person to talk to or communicate with this issue.",1
"Worst experience! Instagram support system sucks. None of the reported bugs were fixed yet. I haven't got the hight quality upload option yet, reported several times but no action taken. Also I am getting delayed messages which is also I reported to insta but still not resolved. I also tried to e-mail but they have changed their address. And the new system to resolve the problem is just read already asked questions. Nothing else. What are you doing Meta are you done with Indian consumers ?",1
"I give Instagram no stars for suddenly disabling my account without explanation! I only like posts and message friends posts I enjoy and now my account is disabled? I can't call and get any information, when sending a message through the support center it tells me to log in, but how do they expect me to do that when they've disabled my account? The system is ridiculous and frankly dangerous! My information may be at risk. This needs to be resolved.",1
"This app consistently gets hacked. My profile hacked now and Instagram has been no help gets it back. This app has too many bugs I can't even upload a video selfie to recover my account , it'll said error and please try again then they don't send the code fast enough before time runs out. This app has been horrible lately.",1
"It seems I'm not the only one. Had to log out of my account as the messanger wasn't working and when I went to log back in all I got was a blank white screen. Tried all the ""fixes"" (uninstall/reinstall, restarting phone, clearing cache, etc) and nothing works. Can still access my account in a Web browser at least. Seeing as how this problem has been going on for a while hopefully the bugs will be fixed soon.",1
"I can't operate the app after updating it for a few weeks. I have contacted Instagram support but there's no response. It's always showing a black screen even after re-installed and restarted my cellphone more than 10 times. I've been using wifi or my own data, but it's still not working. I have to use instagram lite due to this matter. Finally, I can operate the app today, but surprisingly, I still can't update the story until 1 minute after I installed the updated version. What a weird üòë",1
"Was great until recently. Instagram was a clean user friendly app, with great editing options for stories. They are pushing reels for any content creator which is annoying and frustrating. And now it's broken, when I tried to create a new account the screen was blank, so I logged out, screen blank, uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted phone, still blank. Can't even get to the login screen, rendering the app completely unusable. Fix this please for Android",1
"I'm not able to uploaded any post it shows some kind of error... Seriously I'm getting very tired with these things. So many times i raised a query of help for technical issue... But nobody reverts, if anybody know about it... Please.... Reply with some solution if any... ü•≤",1
"I decided to return to Instagram, but once I started a new account my news feed was overrun by accounts I didn't follow, and since my account was brand new the few people I did follow didn't show up at all, just ""suggested accounts"" by the endless thousands. When I tried to link it to my Facebook page, Instagram told me the app was out of date. I updated it, and it still said the app was out of date and promptly force closed. Instagram has completely fallen apart and is basically unusable.",1
"By uninstalling and installing the app removed my 24 hrs note feature, totally pissed of by the help center of Instagram no response... I have raised the complainant mailed them even shared the before and after screenshot of that feature üò§ no use at all if you are reading this fix it ASAP!!!!",1
"Honestly gets worse and worse. I hate logging into it to try and keep up with my loved ones, because I'm constantly bombarded by posts from people I don't follow. The entire direction of the platform is alienating, and it doesn't help me connect with anyone at all. I can't believe how bad its gotten, and it continues to get worse every time I grit my teeth and log into it.",1
"For the past week I've been unable to open the app, it keeps stopping. I've tried to redownload it like 2-3 times but nothing has changed.",1
"Forget seeing your friend's posts, this app is *filled* to the brim with ads. Think you're looking a post? No! It's an ad! What to search for someone? Here's a bunch of ad profiles and then your results! The future is no content all ads. Photo editor is garbage too.",1
TERRIBLE! The aspect ratio is soooo bad for the Z Flip 3. The reel get cut off from the sides and I can't understand what's going on half of the time in the videos. TERRIBLE!,1
"Latest update is a complete dumpster fire, cannot edit more than one photo and saving to drafts warps the photos. I'm on a Pixel 7 and tried all the clearing cache and re-installing. Meta need to stop wasting time on the metaverse and focus,...",1
"When I go in the app it shows a instagram logo and then a black screen. I was deleting the app and turning my wifi on and off. After a few minutes it didnt work this bug is so frustrating and its very annoying please fix this. Sincerely, Curly Amber",1
"I use it personally and professionally and personally it's okay it doesn't matter. But for working, well Instagram in it self is okay but I have to give it a low mark because none of the apps especially the meta business suit app work right. Not only that even ads manager doesn't work that well AND THAT IS HWERE THEY EARN MONEY. It shows how little they care for the usability and there is no real REAL alternative. These are the top social media apps none are like this in use or number of users..",1
"Giving 1 star from 5 cause I'm just frustrated now with so many problems....Like glitches, bugs etc.... Can't post reels in my story,,, News feed isn't updating... Most of the time NOTHING is working in this app!! Moreover after reporting my problem it didn't changed a bit!!",1
"It's unbelievable, I have to upload my reel 16 times until there's no glitch or black screen during the video anymore. If you steal features from other apps, at least do it right.",1
"It has become THE WORST app after adding suggestion videos feature. Now I'M FORCED to see the videos that I DON'T LIKE EVEN A BIT again n again , there are tons of unnecessary and unrelated videos which I HATE TO SEE. Instagram if you want TO FORCE people into seeing your content atleast give them option to choose what type of content they want to see. And PLEASEEEEE add a feature to stop these suggested post, I only want to see the people I follow, not stupid random tiktok stuff.",1
"This is the worst app ever. They don't even give you a option to delete your account. There are many methods to delete your account and I tried them all but all they say is ""sorry your request cannot be completed"". I am giving them only 1 star for other stuff. If you have too many account and you want to delete one , well they don't let you do it. I tried a million ways to delete my extra account but no!, they don't let you do it. They are forcing us to use the account.üò°",1
"Such a buggy update. Everytime I click on the profile tab, the app crashes. Can't even see my own posts. Trying to upload a reel since more than 2 weeks. Everytime i click on post, the app crashes.",1
I hate all the ads. Instagram was good years ago and now it is just like FB or tiktok. It was so good before Zuckerberg took it over. They ruined it with ads. I just want to see my friends' posts and not strangers' stuff. I am so sick of instagram. I get all these feeds of people I don't know. Dogs and animals. I turned to instagram because i hated FB. I JUST wanted to see family pictures.,1
"If I could rate half a star I would definitely do so. I dont know what is wrong with Instagram but either they dont agree with my account or account was hacked, since out of the blue I was forced to log out amd the account was deleted, and now I have constant errors blocking me from making any new account. What a great app, done a ""very good job"" üíÄ",1
Such a worst app.. Before it was working fine now its not at all working and the reels audio making too much of noise and before i used to get lot of views and now no views nothing its really very worst app for ever.. Can any one please fix this i can't able to add the music to the reels please,1
"My original business account was hacked and my phone number, email address, and profile picture we're all changed and I've tried every possible avenue to recover to no avail. It's ridiculous that not a soul can be reached for actual help. I can't even delete the account and can't get ANY FREAKING HELP!! This has been ongoing since May 2022. Why can't you be better IG? With this type of customer support I can't see how the app continues to even be in existence! The most frustrating waste time!",1
"Although Instagram is my favourite social media app but I'm reviewing 1 star today just because of bugs and glitches. Instagram must address the issues happening in group chats especially. Being admin, Whenever I open groupchat's profile, whole insta got glitched and all the messages don't get sent if I don't restart the app again after removing from the history, also majority of the times the adding function don't work. I will only change my review if Instagram fix all these bugs. Disappointed.",1
"Videos stop playing when scrolling through timeline, even if they are the active one on the screen. Also, whoever thought it is a good idea to only load the last couple of reply comments when there are sometimes hundreds of them should be fired immediately. Takes minutes to get to the start of a conversation. Also, no progress bar in videos which makes no sense at all.",1
Too many updates but zero to few issues fixed. It seems like every update creates another bug. Edit: Still 1 star. I don't get new messages unless I manually refresh my messages page. It takes me days to find out that I had new messages when I scroll through my feeds everyday.,1
"So many bugs. Despite updating several times I get a version of Instagram which displays no reels section on profiles and where I can't react with emojis on messages. Also messages icon is the old, arrow one. This app sucks.",1
I am so disgusted with black screen on instagram! I cannot click on stories without a black screen. I am going to leave instagram. It's not worth the frustration. I have followed so many tutorials and nothing works.,1
I'm getting a little annoyed with these fancy new updates. They aren't fancy that cause crashes all the time. I'm super disappointed with the amount of adds as well. Every second video or photo is an add. Further more the videos pause randomly. Seriously if these adds are paying you so much why can't the developers get on fixing the problems faster instead of lazy quick fixes.,1
"It's amazing how this app can go from perfect user interface to completely unusable. They tried to copy Tiktok, but it's so full of bugs you can't do anything. I much preferred it, when the emphasis was on content both images and written. But you can't share any of that now because none of your content is properly shared. I'm lucky if my posts are seen by 5% of my following.",1
"1 star because this app freezes and gets stuck everytime i try to upload stories. And when it does get stuck, theres no way to cancel that upload. Thus i cant switch between my personal & professional accts. This is why your losing ppl to Tiktok. ******HEY! Do you broads working on this app even read these?! Add a story upload cancel feature, it would help a LOT! Until then, you broads at Instagram only get one star. I'm disappointed. Cry ab it.",1
"Uploading reels has become a hassle. No day goes by where I don't have to contact support to fix something. Either the sound of the added music is distorted after uploading or I can't add music at all. And I've done all the usual stuff like updating, deleting & reinstalling the app, trying different video formatting and audio codecs. It's no surprise more and more people are transitioning to TikTok. Much better UX.",1
used to be 5 stars until they went away from a chronological feed and messed with their algorithm... likes went down and started missing a lot of people's posts based on what they thought I wanted to see... use the app a lot less now! Edit: still no chronological feed... almost never use it anymore...,1
"Overall I used to love this app very much but from past few days it's totally annoying me even I saved login information if I got logout then again if I want to login ig I have to put again and again password, neither I can reply the messages nor I can put reactions on others messages... please try to fix this bugs as soon as possible!!",1
"I'm not able to access my account, everything is showing blank and not loading. I have been on this platform for about 7 years with that account and now all of a sudden it's not showing any chats or any feed. I am very disappointed as instagram isn't addressing the issues which are coming up",1
Instagram is not working properly fix the bugs. I am not be able to see my msg or any other content. I've deleted and installed insta for like 10 times and yet I'm not be able to see my msgs fix these problem as soon as possible.,1
"I have 2 accounts and 1 of them keeps saying I have 1 message but I don't! I already cleared my messages requests, the app's cache, the app's data and I already uninstalled and reinstalled it! I already did everything and it's still there! This little bug is so easy to fix yet you guys still haven't fixed it! It's so annoying!!!",1
"The app response time to email is trash despite sending them more than 2 weeks ago . I lost my phone recently , the two step verification codes they gave out to me didn't work at all despite using them for the first time . They haven't responded to any of my emails . The link they sent so that I can log into my account were absolute trash ,None of them works because it refuses to sign me in yet am using a device I frequently used to log into my account .",1
"I used to love this app but the recent errors and glitches are getting out of control. Today, you are showing me a message stating no account with this username exists. I mean, why? I can't log in and its just flashing errors? What is going on? Extremely disappointed Instagram! The technical support must look into these matters.",1
"It's literally now worse. All I see is hashtags I follow that are completely irrelevant and ads. Where are the people I follow?! If I'm halfway down an account's feed, click into see a photo or video, and then click back, Instagram now takes me back to the top of the account's feed. It is so incredibly irritating and unintuitive. Change it back.",1
"Too many bugs!!!! The notes section has disappeared from one of my accounts, and can't see my comments and likes that I get on my comments on my other account , the app keeps crashing no matter which device I use ,what has happened with this app it used to be smooth in operating now its been trash since 2 years or so.",1
I'm being completely serious when I say I've reported well 50 ads within a 2 hour period and a solid 35-40 of them all got flagged and removed for being scams/false information. What in the hell are you doing that allows so many scams to be advertised on your platform. Literally nearly all ads I'm presented are riddled with scams and false information and yeah you're removing them but there shouldn't be this many on here in the first place. Do better.,1
"I always upload reels but not getting views, earlier which I was getting on my regular post. I contacted so many times with Instagram team and raised service ticket but no one responded yet. I feel so disappointed that's why I feel you guys has to work on your costomer satisfaction. Please resolve my issue so that I can again feel better for your service and change my feedback. Thank you!",1
"Instagram just disabled my profile even though my account status says that I have not posted anything to affecting my status. There is a review the decision link, but I am not sure that will go anywhere. Also, all of the help forms are broken. I used to like the app but I don't like that I was disabled without any reason or explanation.",1
"Well, I am not able to update my Instagram messenger. I have followed the Instagram help centre tips, but they're not working. I didn't even see the ""update messaging"" option under settings bar. This is frustrating. I'm from India, all other my friends are using the cool features like changing chat colour, giving emoji reactions to messages etc. I searches the whole web and even reported my problem to instagram still they couldn't resolved my problem.. this is the only reason I'm giving it 1 ‚≠ê",1
The filters suck. Like why have a filter option if you don't have any good filters. They don't change and they don't work most of the time. One reason I still use Snapchat the filters are actually fun and Interesting to use. Honestly I wouldn't even use Instagram if it wasn't for work. Without good filter options theres no use in eve using it.,1
"Update: message reactions just disappeared. I dislike the new feed, like I get it, it's trying to recommend new content to follow, but so much of it is just from repost farms that steal content from others. It's the same reason I don't even use the search/explore tab because it's nothing I even want",1
"Can you be a little serious?? I have two accounts logged in the same app. One account shows the notes feature while thr other has stopped that note feature after a while. Also, i can't reply by swiping the mesaage on one account while on the other i can do it. I haven't even got the 1 min story feature?? Is this the way you guys work?? Instagram was so better when it wasn't in the hands of this stupid Zuckerberg.",1
"I cant even like pictures or even post on my story. Instagram says theyve restricted certain actions to protect their community, meaning i cant even post on my story and i cant like posts. UPDATE: its been over two weeks since I haven't been able to even have access to my account and at this point I'm deleting the app. UPDATE #2: they just updated the app and now I can't text or call ppl back.",1
"EVERY second post is now an advert, sponsored or a suggestion! All I do is scroll through, dismissing things over & over again, regardless off my settings! I just want to see the people I follow! Come on Instagram, it's frustrating... ENOUGH!!!",1
"Instagram is fun in some ways but it's not letting me post!!! Every time I select my images and write my captions it freezes and deletes everything. Even when I save it as a draft, less than a minute later it is gone. It is glitchy nowadays.",1
This app is just terrbile with all these glitches and bugs that need fixing. This is my 15th time reinstalling the app because other peoples highlights keep getting stuck in loading. It crashes occasionaly and sometimes it doesn't even load accounts at all,1
"I have no swipe reply option.Please fix itüòè. It's not working properly,i can't send message to anyone whether it sends bt don't visualise to me. I am unable to see someone's story. After this update i have facing lot of problems üò§üò§ please solve my problem.After this update my captions are not showing after uploading reels or feed also I can't comment on any post, whether I put a comment using ‚ù§Ô∏èüòòüòçüíî this type of emoji or any romantic or hot comment it's not posting and show warning limit ‚ö†Ô∏è",1
"Constantly have issues posting multiple photos in one post. You cannot adjust them all to fit the screen. As soon as I edit the 2nd photo, the first reverts back.",1
"Overall, the app has taken a serious nosedive in quality. The algorithm especially screws over small buisness and artists alike. It's extremely buggy constantly and never seems to get better.",1
"My feed, that is ment to be for the people I follow, is now full of random pages that instagram is trying to push. For every post on my feed of someone I actually follow. I'm spammed by 2 post of some random person's page or an ""sponsored"" ad. Super annoying how this has happened. my feed is for the people I already follow. If I wanted to find something/someone new I'd go to the explore page. Which is what that's ment for. STOP MERGING THE TWO!",1
"Instagram update is trash. If I wanted to see random peoples videos, I would go to the explore tab. It's really annoying that they put random videos in your for you page. You can't even see the people's posts that you are following. It's all ads and posts from people you aren't following.",1
"Don't bother. Not only did this app lock me out twice under the pretense of ""unsual actovity"" (literally my first time ever trying to open the app), but when I made a new account it tried to force me to show my face as a ""verification selfie."" I've never shown my face and it's none of your goddam business what I look like, Instagram. When I signed up, I expected use to be easy. You want me to use your app when you can't be bothered to fix basic functions like logging in? Screw that. Deleted.",1
"At this point they are exploiting the users for political purposes. Bad in terms of content, functionality and interface. For example, a filter on my video doesn't work.",1
"My account @rishiraj.r_ has been hacked,its 1 month now, I have been constantly sending email, to the support team, but to my surprise the support hasn't sent me any mail about it. I am stressed up. I have many conversation on chat,i have been using it for 4 years.I have sent video proof almost 50 times each time it gets disapproved. Almost 10 mails. But nothing. As if the Instagram is totally ignoring my problem. It's very disappointing. Please try to bring my account back.",1
"Instagram algorithm now controls what you see, to keep you scrolling forever.. Was a great experience when it gave you the ability to see recent posts. Now it's out of order and you see things you saw weeks ago again amongst the ads. I'll be ditching it just like I did to Facebook.",1
Even with 100mbps connectivity couldn't able to load reels and feeds. Some big bug in update. I tried install/uninstall many times. Still bug remains and couldn't able to use Instagram past 2 days. Worst experience ever...,1
"Whenever I update the app, I get more troubles! Like now, the text fonts ain't working for me. I mean, everything I write on my story shows up like a ""glitch"" style ?!? + 2 of my accounts were logged out just suddenly and I can't even get a link on my e-mail address to reset their passwords!!",1
"I couldn't even recover my account because of your so-strict features which is unhelpful for users like me who has already no access with the contacts I used when I created my account! It automatically just logged out when I tried to change my number, and even now, I can't log in. Also, you aren't confirming my submitted videos, even though I have photos in my account! Fix your so-called ""reviews"". I guess you are not even trying to review the submitted videos, you just dump it.",1
Please fix bug. If I'm connecting someone on Instagram Video Call Bluetooth is getting automatically disconnected. I tried in multiple devices and multiple brand Bluetooth. I was thinking that it has issued in my device but it was not.,1
"I'm hating Instagram so much right now, I keep trying again and again to reset my password but I can't because it keeps saying that it sent a recovery link to my email but all the inboxes in my email are still empty, I don't receive nothing. So I try on IG web and put my email or my phone and it keeps saying there was a error.. I'm so angry and frustrated",1
"The page keeps relationship adding if you swipe right once done with watching a video, or when you turn your screen back on. This app needs to be patched badly.",1
"Why is it that I can't upload multiple pictures at once, I keep getting an error message saying ""can't continue editing"" I am not trying to edit I want to upload pictures, please fix this, it's annoying to say the least considering the fact that I have never had this problem before!!",1
Why did it start sending dms for when I tag someone instead of just notification. Thats awful fix it pls! I don't want it going to inboxes and filling it up. Also I have not to save photos but every time I post it saves photos to my camera roll! Ugh why change stuff that isn't broken!,1
Absolutely impossible uploading anything more than 1 photo at a time. Try to upload multiple photos and it loads and pops up saying unable to edit. I've redownlpaded the app several times... seems not the only one having issue..,1
"After each update, it's getting worse and worse. My insta account got linked to my mom's fb account. I tried to fix it, but it just says ""Your Instagram version is outdated, update to new version to use feature. "", even though it is fully updated. Even my birth date got changed due to this. Make this bug go away. For now, the app is very bad.",1
"A whole list of issues.. collaborator option doesn't show up, notes feature randomly disappeared, have a limited selection of music to choose from, list goes on",1
"There are bugs in the messages, I can't receive notifications, and sometimes even when I click on the message icon, I can't see if someone texted me or not, I have to refresh the page to see it. Please fix this",1
"I thought Instagram was cool until all of a sudden my girlfriend's whole account was removed because she tried to view a comment. Hundreds of memories deleted in an instantü§¨ü§¨ hundreds of connections from around the world gone. We are currently on holiday and this has completely and utterly upset her and ruined part of our experience. This is not cool, she's never breached the guidelines. Don't invest in this app!!!!",1
"Terrible update, changed layout sucks. Haven't updated insta in a while, fully regretting it. Considering uninstalling. Can't see likes on reels, comments across the platform are annoying, just keep it how it was. Stop making unnecessary changes that revert in a week due to backlash. Find something that works and stick with it. Either that or let me uninstall the update.",1
"Literally nothing works, app loads the same screen over and over again, if you try and use the sort setting in your freinds they don't work. This app is literally garbage, yall need to either get rid of it or use it. This is getting pathetic",1
"I don't know what wrong with Instagram lately, I am not able to upload reel it show my network connection is not good, I have good network connections and I am not even able to upload any stories which is saved from snapchat. I'm so disappointed with Instagram. Please, work on it!",1
Encountered a bug today 20/11. I cannot view my story nor add anything to a highlight without an error message. I thought maybe bc I am in Vietnam. But it was working earlier today. My friends can see my stories and highlight while logged into their account. Get this bug fixed,1
The app sucks. It does not even allow me to reply to my friends messages sometimes because it just shows one darn paper plane icon and that's it. Nothing else. All the themes and stuff just disappear.,1
"I wasnt getting my dms refreshed it was just stuck and i couldnt use dms at all n so i thought ok maybe i got hacked, new update or its just something wrong with my device as in its outdated. it turned out there was no update or anything like that as i had the newest version of insta on my phone atm. i uninstalled, password didnt work. Now im locked out due 'phising' not getting authorization email to unlock my account now im locked due to insta's incompetancy. Piece of üí© app n customer servic",1
Literally the worst experience after the new update where videos are getting converted into reels. I'm a video editor and my posting ratio is always 1:1 but after this update my ig page looks so bad. I hope we can post videos as videos again and reels as reels.,1
"Why the app can't be opened as bubble (popped up) or small window form? I want to chat while using other app. Also, the messaging function is a bit lag, as in delayed. And some of the group chat will disappear after i refresh (pull screen downwards) the chats list page. Please fix.",1
"Whenever I wanna share a photo in my story, it keeps getting black for no reason. My phone and the app are up-to-date, tried my best to solve this issue but I came to conclusion that it might be because of a bug, I need an urgent assistance regarding this issue..",1
"You ban accounts for no reason at all. Yesterday my girlfriend and I only took a couple of pictures for our anniversary, and posted it on her ig story, nothing inappropriate at all, but a while ago she was suddenly banned and can no longer log in to her account, we had precious memories in her archives, and now there's no way for us to retrieve them. Poor use of AI technology, bs of an app.",1
"Instagram used to be a decent service where you shared photos with friends. That's not what it is anymore. Instead, ol' Zuck has filled it with ads every three pictures in the feed, ""suggested posts"", and features aped from other platforms. It sucks now.",1
Literally i don't know what to say about Instagram. The app is good but my account got suspended a few weeks ago for pretending to be someone but it was my account. My personal account with photos of me and my friends. And i messaged and sent so many emails to help me restore it but Instagram did nothing. Didn't send anything back didn't help me with my problem. I think there help center should be better because is at the moment horrible.,1
"I am facing issue related to loading the app content like reels, post, stories of my followers and also unable to see message as well as any notifications related to the app after refreshing any content it's keeps refreshing and unable to load the particular content and everything is messed up in here kindly look Into this matter as soon as possible.",1
"Instagram has a lot of annoying bugs and problems, for example I click on the gallery section to send a picture or video, it does not show the media it only shows some unplayable gray space, doesnt show what I actually send. Fix your app",1
"Now I noticed in the story archive It only keep the very first story of the day. Which means if I put 3 story in one day, after 24 hrs, I can only find back the very first story. Pls fix this !!! as I take this insta story to record down every moment that's worth keeping !!!",1
"Hello!!! Worst app ever. My pictures are routinely deleted for no reason. I have contacted the so-called customer service repeatedly. No response. No changed behavior. This is hurtful and maddening, to have my pictures that go along with likes and comments, obliterated.",1
"It's been a month now I am dealing with a bug in my app, the feed isn't changing even after refreshing the page, it shows the same content again and again of the recently followed page or account, even after lot of scrolling it shows the old content only. Plz look into it.",1
"This app sucks tbh the team need to fix few things, I can't reply to a particular text , it lags most of the time I try to post like it starts buffering and stucks there for days unless I turn off and on my phone I have gone to , help settings and submitted my issue several times got no response, I'm trying really hard to make contents",1
"Was just faced with an issue. I was following 2,001 accounts. And after I unfollowed around 50 people, it STILL shows that I‚Äôm following 2,001 accounts. I refreshed the page, logged out and logged back in on multiple devices, but it shows the same. I have no idea what‚Äôs going on.",1
"Apps is not working properly, it made my phone reboot lots of times, and also, I won't be allowed to log in into my account from other devices, including my computer. Please fix this, I really like this app. But this issues I'm having, are making me hate it.",1
So buggy. The reels button is gone after I updated it to the latest version. Also my while Instagram looks like the older version page. I don't know what's going on. The devs will probably ignore this and not even fix it. Terrible,1
Got a new phone. When I downloaded the app and logged on. Everybody I had followed was reset. And now can't even receive some messages. Update 11/27/22 app is almost useless now. Can't access my profile. All my private messages have been deleted.,1
"My Instagram account is having so many problems, and I've contacted Instagram so many times, and the problems persist! My DM chat isn't working, and I can't download from istories either! I updated yesterday and today is says to update again!! I like Instagram and abide by Instagram's rules and regulations! Yet, my account problems have not been resolved!!! I've tried everything and nothing works! Can you please resolve these problems with my account! If you do, then I'll change my review!",1
Reels are involuntarily zooming in once uploaded and there's no way to change this except to start from scratch. Even then we won't be able to adjust accordingly since the final post suddenly becomes zoomed in without even adjusting the videos while editing,1
"My business account is hacked for almost a month and there is no way to contact Instagram and get it back. I've tried sending an email (no reply yet), tried the selfie video at least 50 times and numerous reports from my personal account. It's unbelievable how such a huge company has no contact email, live chat or phone number with actual people on the other line. I've tried so hard to set my business account the last 3 years and I cannot longer access it due to bad communication. Unbelievable",1
"Your security process makes it really easy for someone to fraudulently scam your users in order to gain access and control their accounts, yet make it so difficult for the original user to recover their access. I have sent multiple requests for support to regain access to my account but I'm met with an automated response saying that you can't verify who I am, yet my sister can send a request with standard information she knows about me and gets further in the support process.",1
"The app is so glitchy lately. [I WOULD NOW DOWNGRADE TO ZERO STARS IF I COULD. The lack of proper technical support makes this a disaster to use particularly for business. My account is down over 2 weeks now and at the busiest time of year.] (Previously: have downgraded my stars because the repost option moving to Create is an absolute pain. Two clicks is now save what I want to reshare, got to profile click plus, click create, click ?, click reshare..... This was fixed)",1
Its not working as how well it used yo work. Very slow and messages take a long time to send despite having good service. Don't get notifications anymore for some reason and is really starting to get on my nerves,1
"I would give it a better rating IF it doesn't kick me out everytime I try to use it PLUS every hour when I am NOT using it it keeps messaging to me that it's ""not responding"" even when I don't have it running in the background! Thanks updates we really didn't need you guya",1
"Keep getting invalid parameters while trying to set the password. So many bugs could not load chat, stories and posts while the internet connection was more than fine. So I tried reinstalling but now can not set the password.",1
"Signal is good, but will not refresh search, stories, personal page unless app is restarted. Then the issue occurs again and again after a few minutes of use at a time. No difference between using wifi or data.",1
"Very bad streaming quality, already uninstalled it cus of bad streaming. Now I have other apps that advertise for this company that lags and makes me restart apps because of a TikTok ad üôÑ very annoying... I remember when FB messenger was like this( lags everything on your phone even if your not using it ) needs a good update won't download again until it's better stream quality üëçüëå",1
"Hate editing pictures to post, I want to post the whole picture but when tried too many times to edit its not the same after the result. So I have to screenshot my pictures and only the face part can see. Dissappointing.",1
"so many of problems of Instagram features and my old account was reported and any information Instagram close my old account. so I don't like to use Instagram, and my new account was don't have music features and reels features and then so many times delete and install the app but the problem was not solved and this messenger feature was not good I can't swipe Reply to anyone.",1
"Bug is still there after updates. Photo automatically cropped after editing with multiple photos post. Not just me, i notice more n more people facing same issue. Instagram started the photo posting trend but make the photos so ugly now!",1
"""Couldn't refresh feed"" this app is essentially broken and it's mind boggling that it's been like this for this long. Tried clearing cache, data, reinstalling. Edit: finally working. 2nd Edit: it's doing it yet again. Get it together! 3rd Edit: the fact that this is still a thing, you guys should be embarrassed.",1
Useless app. The app has no sense and no eyes to understand and to see. Because Facebook app and Gmail app are opened in mobile but the Instagram is showing that the password is incorrect when we open through Facebook account. Really irritating app. The app developer should keep log in option as user-friendly and it's unable to identify even simple I'd.,1
"Following comments conversation is difficult, it is very buggy. My feed is broken, it hits posts fr my friends and puts old post on top, it is a mess I missed soany posts of my friends and it always photos if you posted a reel it will keep it on top of my reel until I fully watch it and will remove any photo posted if I saw it. Worst feed ever right now, ihave tonally checky friends and do not trust the feed anymore. Unsisbribed fr channels with many reels as they are now annoying with such feed",1
I don't know if you noticed this but the quality of photos and videos is not good. Good thing there are way more awesome apps like Capcut and TikTok among others. I can't believe Instagram can't keep up with them.,1
"Instagram's algorithm has been affecting artists in a huge way due needing to upload reels to even be noticed. It's understandable that a social media brand would to improve, but to basically attempt to act like TiKTok is not the way to do it. Artists use to be able to have fun with this platform for years; however, a good portion of artists open up Tumbler accounts because there's no use in staying on something that's only going to get worse, unless, there's something to make it better for real",1
Never a dull moment of glimpses into our world. Hours of fun for you and your family. Viewer discretion advised and buyer beware on the ads. This app keeps crashing with zero support from Meta! So it gets 1 star until they fix the issue that i believe is intentional. They are a vindictive Company! Now the app freezes my phone and is still glitching. What an untrustworthy app it's become but you still can see real murder on it go figure but an Arreola is taboo. Use at your own risk!,1
"Never thought I would leave a review, but my account was randomly deactivated this morning for ""not following community guidlines"" I never post or comment anything. I clicked the ""disagree"" button, filled in both of the codes for email and phone number verification. And now my account doesn't exist anymore. This is totally uncool because the app will not allow me to submit a help request because they ""cant verify my identity"". I had really important pictures on my profile. And its very upsetting",1
It is becoming the worst app from this year... Lots and lots of bugs appearing on regular basis.. which makes me irritating and now I am quitting using it. If this continuous bug and glitch problem continues then the day is not far when no one will use it.,1
"fix your reels, I get options above 30 seconds like 60 and 90 but everyone I try to process content I get limited to 30 sec despite me selecting a longer length. if I can't do it don't include the option otherwise be better for, this is sad.",1
The App is bot working anymore. Everytime I open it nothing of the content is actually showing. I just see black boxes were pictures are supposed to be. When I uninstall and then install it again it works for a short time and then the same thing keeps happening. I probably have reinstalled this App 10 times now. And it gets worse faster everytime I do that. Please correct this! It is really exhausting. Because I need to use it to promote an organization.,1
"I really never used an app with so many bugs... Every time I try to post something, I have to try so many times, and get so many errors that give no information about what went wrong. Minimizing the app, restarts the selection, which is hard in the first place as there is no normal photo browser. The cropping keeps lagging, and I find myself deleting the cash over and over again. It's really the worst experience. I am a programmer, and I've never seen an app that cares so little for bugs.",1
"Everything is extremely terrible, I have been using this app for 2 years and it failed to disappoint me, first it was the login and the blank screen I could not see or do anything please fix that, Feeds and profiles are loading so long, and when I need to see a message it's only shows the read not the ones that are not red, Please fix this it's been going in a year now, Stop being like ticktok is runining my experience, I just want to see my friends pictures. Hope you fix this! Thanks",1
"Overall, it's pretty great. But a bit after the pandemic began to cease, it's been getting worse and worse. My map0p problem comes with making new accounts, if you already have an account on your phone, it's nearly impossible to add another. I used to have 3 accounts and they all worked perfectly fine. But once I tried 4o change one, it force stopped all my accounts. Over only the past 3 years, I might have had almost 8 accounts because of this recurring problem. Pls fix it.",1
"I always liked Instagram, mostly for it's simplicity, the way photos can be edited and the way profiles are viewed. Nowadays it's honestly just trash. Wherever you are you are bombarded by content you have not chosen to see. There is more content of pages you don't follow than of pages you do, even on your main page! Such a shame of an app that was once very nice... And that's not even beginning about the countless bugs that happen whenever you want to post something. Not worth it",1
"I'm experiencing all manner of bugs at the moment, activity not updating, feed not updating, comments not showing, not being able use audio for reels for periods of time, or posting reels with audio and then teh audio disappears once posted, but the track derltails remain on the reel... not being able to respond to a message or highlight a message in a group can't to respond to. The list is endless, when will these bugs get fixed, and why do saves no longer count for toffee on reels?! Aaaaargh!",1
"It worked ok till 1,5 week back. Since then I see only a blank page/black page. Some days my dm's works, some days not at all! Uninstall/re-install doesn't work. Even a browser, PC or other devices have the same thing. WiFi of data doesn't make any difference. It works middle of the night for an hour or so and then again it's out. I made many complaints but no response nor action to solve it. It's my line to the outside world. I'm extremely frustrated and angry! Hope it will be fixed VERY SOON!",1
"I haven't been able to properly use the app in months. If I play a reel the video is terrible. Can barely see what the video is of. It's like trying to watch t.v on an old school t.v with an antenna. I thought it was maybe my phone, but seeing so many other reviews with the same type of issues says otherwise. That's if I can even open the app without it crashing instantly. I've tried reinstalling, that dosen't work.",1
"It has been a disaster for the last couple years. The algorithm is beyond useless now. And now I can't upload photos - doesn't give me the option when I click +, only says gallery but it's completely blank but I have got a few folders that I could see through last week, now I cant. I've uninstalled it and forced stop, nothing. And I can see the photos when I go to my own gallery.",1
"I had a very smooth experience so far, but recently got my account hacked, and my username, phone number and authentication were all changed. I could only get to the first step of login through my email and there the otp code is sent to hackers phone. The worst thing is Instagram doesn't have any contact that can be utilized to restore my account. The hacker deleted all of my pictures from my profile, and added all of different pictures so there is no way I can verify through video selfie.",1
"1. Poorly designed - cannot do simple things. I cannot believe the hoops I'm required to jump through to select the photos & videos I want to post and the hoops I need to jump through to get them to show the way I want. 2. Lately, it simply doesn't work. It won't post simple stories - a photo with text. I have good internet connection, I clear the memory and the cache... same story. This app eats hours of my time for a simple post. Haven't even mentioned the spam! It's so bad.",1
"Instagram has been a dumpster fire lately. Its so bugged, and broken. This app barely functions and its getting really complicated to use, there's bots everywhere, and they always add updates no one wants. This app is garbage i would delete it if my friends didn't message me there. You can get banned for anything, i hate this app.",1
Stop trying to be tiktok. I don't want to see comments on half of my screenü§Æ I report the comment spam when the floating one appears. People upload full yt videos and I can't go forward-backward. What's this suggested posts line. Instagram keeps getting worse every minute. Thank you for freshing the page when I literally just open the app and haven't seen the post you freshing over. Can't see subtitle because you put unnecessaries half the screen.,1
"Like everyone else this has recently stopped working, app just shows a blank screen. Thanks guys. 2022 update: yeh, still broken even on a new phone. 2023 update: not related to the app but my 10y+ personal account was banned, and photo verification was rejected so now that account's gone ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm done with 'gram, you guys are the worst",1
"really soo little amount of any interesting content and/or rigid system of suggestions in reels flow (man, i'm reaaly tired of clicking ""not interested""). There is no any usable instruments of followers management in GUI (e.g. find accounts who not followed you back), ""undo"" window after clicking ""not interested"" do not dissapear to long while hiding things on screen... Man app is sucks, u gotta find an adequate ui/ux designers team.",1
"this is a great app, like perfect, all of my social life is on here. BUT so many glitches and bugs. I can't send photos sometimes, I don't have the 'notes' feature and my 'saved' isn't working",1
Became monotonous app after getting in control of facebook. Please don't try connect instagram with Facebook. The option of disconnecting is not working on instagram. Neither I found such option on facebook. It's such a huge waste of time. Please fix this issue.,1
"My Instagram is not working properly .. I did all the process like restart the phone, reinstall the App. But it was still not working. I hope you can fix the bugs in Instagram. As soon as possible Thank you. I hope you reply Soon",1
I don't think that now Instagram remains secure for private chat. I have lost all my chats with random people. You need to improve the security of private chat. It can't get auto-deleted without a user desire to delete. What if a user wants to read their old chats? Very poor experience by day to day update.,1
"I haven't been able to log into my accounts, it keeps saying the username you've entered cannot be found. Whenever I use the ""Get help logging in"", it says I should try again later. It's really frustrating. I can't log in on the web and in mobile. I hope this is fixed soon. This is a major bug that y'all aren't paying attention to.",1
"My homepage has been completely tampered with. I'm seeing the same posts for 10 days now and none of the posts of people I follow is showing up. I deleted the app and reinstalled it, checked the website, it's the same issue there as well. Please let me know if you want me to delete my profile altogether. This is a very broken experience.",1
Bug; I add the photo and it distorts/stretches it to the point you have no idea what it is. Can't upload photos anymore. I uninstalled it and reinstalled and it's still not working.,1
Extremely disappointed with instagram! My account got hacked last week. I have been trying to recover my account since then but there is no support from instagram!! I chose the option that I have pictures of myself and uploaded the video of my face proving my identity. I was told that I will get some response in 3 - 4 days but there is no response no support. Its been 5 days and tried to going through the same route again bt the app keeps crashing!!,1
"The app has been dying recently. Not much worth using it for anymore but i sometimes go on it when bored. Recently it's been really annoying because i open the app and see a post, i begin reading it and then my feed just refreshes. This happens every time i open the app it's seriously so annoying. Please fix this.",1
"Updated to force me to allow microphone permissions for whenever I use the app instead of asking for permission every time I need microphone access. This raises security and privacy concerns, and can record even when I'm not intending to use the microphone.",1
The app doesn't work properly. When somebody sends me a message it doesn't send me a notification unless I open the app and see that somebody messaged me. Only then the notifications start to come properly but not for long. I have checked in the settings and I have them on so it's not a phone problem because other apps send me immediately. Also when I'm watching a story the video will stop playing you will only hear the voice or the music that's in the video and it won't load the next one.,1
"When writing large posts instagram has a tendency to lose the post. With no drafts section this means I end up reediting and rewriting large quantities of material. Sometimes, after I click post, I get a notice saying: ""We cannot post your photo, please try again"". However it gives no explanation of what was wrong with the photo or an option to adjust the post and then try again. The only option is to discard and rewrite from scratch. Thoroughly fed up with this app",1
"One star because, for some reason my reels feature & also effects feature doesn't work. I have done everything you can imagine to fix this, I even un installed then reinstalled the app. Music will never load on my reels, even if I spend a whole day trying, and this goes for effects too! Reels which is supposed to be the new feature, y'all are encouraging us to use, the feature with a good algorithm!!! To say I'm frustrated with this app is an understatement!!!!!! Please fix this",1
"This app is a disaster. Instead of trying to be tiktok, it should focus on being usable. For the past four months I haven't been able to open my Instagram app despite being on the latest update of both my phone system and the app. I've reached out to the bug/customer support team so many times with no response or improvement. Not only this, but the constant changing of algorithm makes it very hard for a lot of creators to build/maintain their audience. Especially artists and cosplayers.",1
"If I could give zero stars, I would. Let's start with the millions (billions) of spam bots, which FB/Insta doesn't do anything about, so it makes the app look more popular than it really is. This of course means you will constantly see and be forced to deal with spam and fake accounts. Oh and don't bother tapping ""not interested"" on photos, or reels because you'll only see double the amount. It's a broken app full of negativity and desperation in the form of ""followers"" who don't care about you.",1
I'm having this problem of showing highlights.My story highlights are not visible to others. And also it's not even shown to me. Another problem I'm having is I don't know why the picture quality reduces after I post any picture on my story or on profile. Please do consider this.,1
This app is very good and entertaining...but it can divert your mind from study I will say that use this app in limitation don't over use this app....in other way the app is very good u can use it... The problem I'm facing recently is that when I am trying to login it is showing a black screen there is no option of creat a account or login Instagram fix this. Again recently a new tab is featured by instagram know as note icon but in my app it is not showing......so it's my request to fix it.....,1
"New updated version is very bad. You can't remix the original reels. When you going to add song , start playing another song. There're so many bugs. Why the hell I downloaded new version. Please resolve this. I'm totally disappointed. Instagram response me üòûü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1
I can no longer share stories across different apps. Can be only shared via direct messages. Absolutely useless. I can't watch reels in repeat from accounts I follow/like as it immediately switches to some other random reel.,1
"I changed my password and logged out of Instagram for once, then tried logging back in, with two factor authentication active. I didn't have access to the phone number I put in the app but I had recovery codes, but those recovery codes aren't working anymore. It's like the last time I changed my password, codes changed too but Instagram didn't give me new codes, and it was done for me, so I put a request on Instagram support to get access but they haven't even checked it yet. I need my account.",1
It will no longer let me post on my business account - it crashes/closes when I move past the edit screen. It claims there are bugs in the app that need to be fixed by the developer. So please fix it!,1
"Why did you remove the drawing feature for posting pictures on your story but when you post reels it's there?? Who asked for a useless button that doesn't do anything instead of the drawing feature?? Stop redesigning the layout for stories and keep the actually useful things, I don't need a filter when I post a picture on my story Instagram",1
"Everyone is just complaining about Insta bugs but why there is no improvement till now? And how this app rating is still 4.3? Full of bugs, with each new updates not only the last issue isn't getting resolve but its also keep bring new bugs. Bugs like: Regular Insta stopped issue, neither messages nor feed is getting loaded even with fast WiFi connectivity, and many more.....",1
"Is a disaster of an app now. No longer able to get into my account for no reason and it hasnt been disabled. Yet i can open a new account no issue. Finally got in after 48hrs, then stupidly logged out and now cant get back in and 2FA doesnt work. Both 6 digit code and backup codes. None work. Keep saying try again. Of course received no assistance. Also face in circle doesnt respond either.",1
"Instead of giving unnecessary updates plz fix the bugs first it can't reload anything while switching one account to another messages are not loading quickly and it doesn't show messages properly and did reload anything properly simply irritating . I can't send are recieve message for last two days, simply waste.",1
"insta stories keep pausing and not resume. i should go forward and back for it again it's very annoying this issue from 7 months, and no updates have solved this issue, and videos and reels keep frizzing and only i hear sound for this reel .. check your bugs before you release new update",1
"There is an trouble while uploading a video in it. My videos were not uploading. It's showing incomplete. It shows ""There is a problem while uploading video try again"" but I try lot of times, there is no change in it !!",1
My Facebook messenger linked chat is not working anymore. At first the notification for new messages wouldn't disappear after viewing it. I tried reinstalling the app then and this time more chat notifications popped up but I had the same problem. I can't even delete or leave the chat and the app blames it on poor internet connection.,1
"Trying to put so much more features, and the mosto simple and basic tool does blood work: posting photos. When posting in bond, when edit one, the other one lost all the adjustments and get wrong crop and wrong edge",1
I got locked out of my account one day and was required to scan my face. That is really questionable. This needs to be taken out. Also my timeline is always out of order and I don't see everything from everyone I follow so that's bad. The auto refreshing of the time line that happens often is annoying at best.,1
"Anytime I try to log in it just says wait a few minutes before trying to log in again, and it doesn't matter what day I try nor if I Uninstall then reinstall or if I just clear the data on the app. And for some reason the same thing happens with the website on my phone, and yes I have tried making a new account but it won't let me it just shows the same stupid screen",1
"Come on... For an app boasting 1B+ downloads, the lack of support for Android users is disgraceful. The insane amount of bugs and glitches never seem to get fixed, and the constant barrage of bots won't ever be a priority. The experience of the app is ruined by the bugs, and it drove me insane to the point where I am writing a review... something I rarely care to do. Seems that Instagram solely cares about gathering your personal data and selling your info.",1
"Very bad application. When I want to add a new account, it says that it is not possible or even that I create it. I deleted the application and re-downloaded it and nothing happened and I changed the mobile and also they tell me I could not change the email and Facebook and also it remains ŸÉŸÖÿß ŸÉÿßŸÜ ŸÑÿß ÿ™ÿ∫Ÿäÿ± ŸàŸáÿ∞ÿß ÿ¥Ÿäÿ° Ÿäÿ¨ÿπŸÑŸÜŸä ÿ£ÿπÿ∑ÿ®ŸäŸá ÿ™ŸÇŸäŸÖ ÿ≥Ÿäÿ° ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±ÿ¨Ÿàÿß ÿ≠ŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¥ŸÉŸÑÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿ£ŸÇÿ±ÿ® ŸàŸÇÿ™",1
"App is so glitchy with latest update. Can't edit photos, they go black or white so you need to plan ahead to properly order them. Try to edit photos individually but only the first pic shows. Total fail here.",1
"IG was an amazing app. But getting worst day by day. I was facing major issues. Some of them are messaging, frequent adds, dark and light mode... And so on... But these days my Instagram is freezed, after 5th November 2022 I was having same post on my wall, not a single drop is new. Added queries and support but no one is there to reply. It is like a black hole. Dev team must have to focus on work not on layoffs. Bless you guys.",1
"Reels has entirely taken over my feed. If I wanted to watch videos I'd be on YouTube or TikTok, not Instagram. The reels are subpar and I'd rather have actual photo posts again, regular posts are way better. I also keep getting spammed with LITERAL porn when I don't even want it, and I've noticed that literally NOBODY that I follow is on my feed anymore because it's been taken over by reels and literal porn from accounts I don't even follow.",1
"Adding content to this app is an adventure. You have pre-cropped your images to the correct aspect ratio. You have run the media scanner app so the new images actually do show up in the selection. You press next after selecting the images in the order you want. Some of them are black. Nevermind, try again, go back. The selection is lost. Next selection - all images look good now. Forward button doesn't forward now. Go back select again. ""The image couldn't be processed"". If it doesn't crash.",1
"For some reason I can't add captions to my stories, I don't have text-to-speech feature and when I report a bug 'it fails to upload'. I don't know what else to do. I can't update to a newer version of the app either.",1
"Literally unusable. App just displays a white screen after the initial loading. It's been like this for a month straight now, and I've kept up with the latest updates hoping the team would do something to fix it, but no luck. I've tried everything and nothing fixes it. This is only my latest problem with it. Every major update they break something else, and I've had continuous problems for a year straight now.",1
"Instagram used to be a good app. I used to be able to use it with no errors and glitches all over. Sometimes, when I want to text, all the chats and groups don't show up at all. The inbox wouldn't load at all either. It would be like this for days/weeks before it fixes on its own. Other times, my feed is full of pictures of nature, thing which I never look at. And now my app keeps on crashing every 5 minutes! I am sick of this app. It's not what it used to be. Fix your app, Instagram!",1
It crashes for some different reason every time it gets an update. 1. Crashed everytime I have opened the app 2. Crashed every time I tried to watch a reel 3. Crashed every time I have opened my dms 4. Crashed every time I tried to type a message or a comment 5. Crashed every time I opened my camera 6. Crashed every time I opened my notifications And 7. It keeps crashing every time I open my saved posts. Even a blind kid with no arms who has dislexia can program better than Instagram devs.,1
"I hate that it's not connected with Facebook! The business accounts are not connecting with a Facebook pages. The app keeps continuously asking if I want the same profile picture as on Facebook! Offcourse not! I try to connect with a page, but then it loads and does change the profile pic into my Facebook picture. I want to have the same profile pic as my business page but not my personal one!!!!!! There are a lot more things not working with business profiles.. too much to discuss here.",1
"Features lag so bad and editing text disappears once you add 3 or more timed texts so you have to fight with it like close open, etc so text editing will show again. For reels Share to Facebook will show available when you save your draft but then sometimes will change to unavailable when you go back to post it for no reason. Too many glitches to count!",1
My account was locked due to suspicion of phishing activity. Verification code won't send to what I assume is my old email that I still have access to btw and the number listed isn't even mine. I've tried everything in their help page and nothing worked to retrieve my accounts back. I've never had this issue since using this app when it came out and now years of photos are out the window. Thanks for nothing.,1
"when trying to add more that one photo to the post, app is never consistent, every edit of one of the photos impacts all the others or one of the photos becomes a duplicate and the other one disappears. the app is not appropriate for editing photos or combining them - only for posting them already prepared, so i would need to have more apps unnecessary.",1
"1) to start with, my phone freezes completely for 3 minutes as soon as I open the app. 2) when in the app and I see another user's videos it allows me to view the first 6 or 7 videos and the rest it's just a black screen with the video sound playing. 3) the algorithm is sooo bad now, it doesn't show my posts or stories to other users like it used 4) So many scammers. Randomers texting you weird stuff on the daily. Used to be an incredibly good app, horrendous now. Uninstalling.",1
"All websites aggressively promoting to install the app get one star. Most of links to Instagram are broken and don't lead anywhere. Most of working links are opening the web page promoting to install the app, instead of the post I'm looking for in the app or web version. When a service works this way it's useless trash. After I left this review they just blocked my account. Good job, Meta! You will solve all the problems of your buggy app by blocking users, who say about it.",1
"Omg it's been so irritating to use this app these days.... As am facing a lot of problems.. Initially they use to get sorted automatically... But now as the time is passing these bugs idk... Omg so many of them.. I can't find an option for themes, neither do i get an option of sharing reels with my friends... Can't evn point out particular message from the chat...it has become like one of those earlier ig with solid color background and no option of reacting to the messages...",1
"I've been on insta since the start. It's now an empty-minded, force fed, commercialized, profiteering, buggy, glitchy, hate-festering place. I miss the warmth of community and not being shouted at to buy things constantly with videos overwhelming the platform. Why does everything have to turn into tiktok??? And surely all the glitches could've been fixed by now??",1
what's wrong with this app? do you guys even take the time to notice the bugs and fix them? the updates seem to be useless. messages can't be sent at times which causes awkward conversations and the editing on photos would not apply after the photos have been posted.,1
"Update 01/2023 - they have more ads than before Instagram has started mixing more ads within your stream. Previously ads and related content would go at the end of what your friends posted. There would be a couple of sponsored posts in-between but it wasn't bad. Now you see a bunch of junk content before and after the posts from people you follow. It's 10x more annoying than it ever was. I'm not a heavy user, but I'll likely remove it if it continues",1
"From last past 4-5 days after auto update my instagram is not working properly. I can't see my messages chats and my friends list in message and I can't scroll reels , can't send messages to anyone can't see chats and can't post a story and I am unable to run my Instagram account . Facing Worst experience. please make it work properly.",1
"What is wrong with is app!? At first when I reinstalled it, I couldn't use the 'add yours' sticker. Again when I reinstalled it.... I could neither use 'add music' option... Nor I can see other people's notes! To use this application... Is such a headache! If there was a 0 rating star.... I would've been given that!",1
"Instagram is not at all working not able to see any notification not able to see any video not even images and reels. Please check what's happening with this app, Even though my WiFi network is good..... Please look into this and resolve as soon as possible...",1
"I am unable to send messages in my chats and when I open an unread message, it soon becomes highlighted again and again. The strange part is, nothing is loading in DMs whereas everything is working perfectly fine in feeds and explore. Please fix this issue.",1
"Terrible glitch in the system currently, making it impossible to edit when posting multiple images. Such a shame in a previously good app. This has been going on for weeks and not resolved.",1
"Been using Instagram for years but all of the sudden my account just got kicked for absolute no reason. Tried to recover back my data, ended up getting repeated error messages. To makes matter worse Instagram itself do not have an email support center as they stop reading other people complain and have a website to answer most questions. Certainly didn't help my scenario. Would really wish this is fixed it's really since I like using this app a lot. I hope I could get back my account.",1
"Used to be good. Now? Filters keep disappearing, and it is incredibly buggy. Editing more than one picture at a time often sees it crashing or the editing not working as you cycle through. Endless ""do a reel"" messages. Increasingly becoming unusable for photo editing and sharing as Meta focus on competing with TikTok.",1
ETA: App is now almost totally nonfunctional. Tried updating. Tried a fresh install. Won't load anything. Won't show msgs I've sent or received since a few days ago. Orig: The messaging system is completely messed up. Started before the swap to the cross platform msging. It stopped giving message details first. Inbox stopped auto-refreshing. It's getting worse. Msgs show as sent for hours when they've actually already been read and responded to. My inbox won't actually update. Constant issues.,1
Became worst I can't see who sent msgs to me from a day I am waiting. And by thinking that insta is best app I sent my some documents to my friends but now I can't see at allüôè. What's going on in Instagram. Nowadays it's becoming worst app. I am trying to see my messages but it doesn't shows at all.. Thank you for your very very memorable experience. I didn't even imagined that insta is going to be like this.üôè #messaging #insta If it's not came till today night I will delete my Instagram id.,1
Such a frustrating app. Constantly have to resize photos and videos to fit the Instagram platform. Too many unwated notifications that I cannot stop reoccurring. Too many reels. So frustrated with how many steps there are. Wish photos would just auto size without having to go through a bunch of steps. Not enough privacy on this app!,1
"Too many advertisements in the feed being pushed. I see more ads than friends photos. It's so annoying that I've take the step, if there's a business ad that shows up in my feed I use - I've stopped purchasing from them & won't use any product that shows up as an ad in my feed in any social media platform. Sick of all the ads!",1
"Currently have an issue where earlier today out of the blue I keep getting a can't refresh feed. I've tried , restarting my phone, clearing cache, uninstalling, reinstalling. I know my internet is fine cause I've tried multiple different WiFi's plus my regular data. I literally can't do anything and it only happens when I log into my account. Everything says it can't be loaded and after a while just jumps to another page throwing an error code.",1
"I don't understand why when I post to my business profile, it destroys the quality of my photos, crops them weird, completely glitches some photos and other bugs. What's going on?? It was never this frustrating to post before the past year. I've been having issues trying to post for so long now! Why is no one noticing or updating anything for it??",1
"Holy hell these apps have gotten bad. I literally can't do anything on these anymore. Can't make posts, can't change any of the info on my page, can't change profile pics or cover photos and there's absolutely no help. Also it truly seems that they are trying to make the entire experience as confusing as possible. It takes me forever just to figure out how to do basic things like share my own page and things like that.",1
"Sorry but the UI/UX changes made in the last update and the new changes being made in this update are only making features harder and harder to find when I want to share something or save a post. And the ads are too much... posts are being replaced and pushed elsewhere before I get a chance to see them. This is getting too annoying, Thanks but no thanks, I'm out. Best of luck to everyone else.",1
"Feed does not load properly. Posts do not always get posted as stories. Reels do not get uploaded. Posts do not get uploaded. Inbox does not reflect sent messages unless refreshed several time over. The bot issue is out of control. So, so, so fed up of this app.",1
"Impossible to use this app on android as a creative. Ridiculous upload bugs - upside down videos, remixes freezing even though look fine while editing, music dissapearing, black screening. Like what the actual hell is happening here? Is this really some sort of master plan to force people to use Apple products? I have never experienced this many issues with the app. It has become literally impossible to make content apart from sharing photographs. What's going on guys??",1
"Cannot reply to specific messages on direct messages. I look up everywhere, and it says hold the text and click reply or swipe right...neither of those two things work?! Used to work on my old phone but now my s22 Ultra can't do it. Please fix this!",1
"10/31: I have not been able to get into my account for days. I keep getting a prompt to enter a security code, which Instagram never sends me. They never respond to help requests. This app sucks since Meta took over. 10/1: Like several other users, I don't have the option to access my photo library when I try to post. My Gallery/Photos were photos I've already posted to Instagram. I tried disabling/enabling Instagram's access to my photos and videos in settings, and that has done the trick.",1
Messages dissapear for hours. Love using Instagram but can be very frustrating getting a message notification that when looking in the inbox just dissappears. The message sometimes doesnt reappear until hours or days have passed.,1
"It's still doing the same as my last review: When I open the app, it will show me the most recent post in my feed for half a second and then disappear. Most times I'm unable to find it again unless I search their profile. Edit: Now the post disappears when I swipe to see the next photo in the post. So frustrating!!!!",1
"Hello üëã. Instagram was a really good social media platform, Right now everything is different now you can see people who you don't want to see and most of the time Instagram is not working even if you have the latest brand-new flagship phone. Mainly advertising is worse right now everything is the ad's all the time when you scroll down you will receive relevant and irrelevant ads.",1
"Soo glitchy on my Samsung üò≠üò≠ I should at least be able to edit an image before posting without the entire app glitching and crashing. I've never been able to save drafts on Android either and whenever they actually save they malfunction before they post so there's no point. Also sometimes when the editing stage actually goes smoothly, it just removed all the effects as soon as it posts???? Do better. Samsung S21 Edit, 6 months later and I still can't post a carousel ü´†",1
Tldr: Deosnt launch but still transmits lots of data. App no worki. Had it installed for a long time. Never actually used it because I had it incase I need it in a social situation. Needed to get barbers @ insta and it just opened and just had the instagram logo and nothing else. Just a logo with a black background and the app never actually launches. Fun part is that the app still transmits lots of data. Specially for an app that doesn't even launch.,1
"Ever since the latest update the app now has bug where the ""Saved"" banner that pops up at the bottom of the photos after you press the save button on a post now never goes away unless the page is refreshed, and sometimes spreads between posts on a feed or account so after saving one post in the feed, all posts below it also display the ""Saved"" banner on-top of the photos until the feed is reloaded, even if those posts themselves weren't actually saved at all.",1
"This app has gone from good to bad on my Android tablet. Now it wants to ""double"" post any DM that contains a ""link"" to another website. It posts two messages, 1) just a regular sent message and 2) the second duplicate is sent as an image with the little ""airplane"" icon. Could you guys just leave things alone!!!",1
"My instagram explore page is filled with nature photographs, trees, animals. They have replaced my old explore with this. Please clear the glitch. I even sent a report and ofcourse as usual I didn't get a response neither got my problem fixed. It's been 2 weeks since then I have been seeing only nature photos in my feed page",1
"App bugs getting worse and worse It's not loading new content... Videos play a few seconds in, then stops and doesn't buffer/play any further. Content Doesn't load after scrolling twice. I can't view my followers/following list because it won't load. I can't see my messsges as that page ALSO doesn't load.",1
"For the videos which are long it doesn't show the full video and even the option for watching the full video is not there like before, before it used to ask us if we want to watch the full video but now it neither shows the full video nor the option The app gets diplayed on the main screen but in all aps it is not there then when I check again it shows that the app is not installed",1
"So many bugs. Timer on music doesn't work, the screen is not full according to the screen size of my phone and it takes a long time to load. Not clear things move. Can't add music to post anymore. FIX IT.",1
"The new updates are not updated in my specific account. Most of the people got the Add Topics option in reels but I didn't receive it. Because of this my engagement is bad and i can't hop on new trend. Similarly, recommend to Facebook update came after 8 months after it was initially worked for my friends. They got more followers with that content since many people were viewing unlike me. Please fix this. It's annoying.",1
I am using Instagram from 3 years. There are little bit bugs in starting. But now there are so many bugs. No reels and stories are showed in my account and not showing messages in chat box. My internet is properly working but only Instagram app is not working. Please remove all the bugs..,1
"For some reason, the save icon is no longer available on the reels, I can only save em when I'm not on the reel mode. Also the amount of soft core porn disguised as ""ads"" are unreal. Can't scroll for more then 3 post without a half naked chicks page promoting an ""only fans"" or something and all I follow are art pages... Like what the hell.",1
"Don't even deserve a one star at all. Everytime doing a call or videocall, the screen will turning off automatically and it's frustrating me, and when share the screen too. It's pretty annoying when u need to on the screen everytime u doing a call and then within second, the screen off again. Fix this ASAP!",1
Trying to create a reel like I always do and when I try to move along the video at the end to select a cover photo for it the photo is all distorted and stretched down really long and I can't upload a photo for it as I only took videos. Please fix.,1
"I've been trying to make a post with multiple, lightly edited pictures for about an hour now. Without fail, the app crashes every time. I've restarted my phone, reinstalled the app, nothing changes.",1
"It's so sad that we've may have to use this medium to reach out to Instagram. It works fine but recently My account @leurr.online was wrongfully disabled. I can't appeal because it keeps saying incorrect Instagram url, which makes total sense because you can't use an already disabled account url. Please I did not violate any rule, we've put in hard work and strength to just lose it like that. I would love to have it back as soon as possible. Thanks Account name: LEURR ‚û°Ô∏èWOMEN'S MAGAZINE ‚¨ÖÔ∏è",1
"So many bugs lately. Creating reels is impossible due to the forever spinning loading circle, multi-photo posts are askew or the vignette inversed, different user settings for different locations. What a nightmare, sort out your software.",1
"New updates just keep making the app worse and worse. See less and less of the people I actually follow and notifications disappear after a week. I don't use Instragram that often! Give me a chance to respond to people. App is becoming an unusable. ""Snooze suggested posts for 30 days"" doesn't even hide them for 3. This app is so broken, it's embarrassing",1
"Crashes regularly, including losing posts/comments/photos (have had to redo the same post 4+ times) if you click out, unable to copy text, doesn't load reply text box when you click. Glitching constantly. Just all round frustrating to use üòí",1
"After the update Instagram is not working. Not able to open any msg which has been received, the feed is not loading unable to see stories, not even able to see reels. Its been happening from last update. Kindly look into the issue. I am unable to use Instagram from last 2 days",1
"Infuriating and unprofessional. I tried to sign into an old account, and it told me I had to enter a 6-digit code that they sent to my phone. No code comes. I clicked the link to have it resent, and I was told to wait a few minutes before retrying. A few minutes later, rinse and repeat. So I tried to create a new account, but I have the same problem. I can't find a phone number, email address, or chat window to get support from an actual person anywhere.",1
"God!!! This app has gotten so much worse. Firstly, it made that notes feature available then after 3 weeks, I'm not able to get it in my main account. Secondly, I've been temporarily blocked from leaving a like on any post. I mean what the heck is wrong man!! I never did any such activity to get me blocked from liking a post. I've reported it a number of times but still no response from the team. Such a useless app!!!",1
"It has frozen and nothing is loading through my Samsung S22 Ultra. Before it was poor photo quality (even HR option). I have restarted, turned it off and on and uninstalled. Installed it again and same problem. Frustrating. Seems like instagram has ongoing issues with androids in general? Hope it gets fixed asap. Thanks",1
Facing a lot of glitches with the app. Trying to play Voice audio the app shuts off. Messages notification arrives lately after the actual message arrival time. Visiting a followed profile after loading the profile the post displays and then disappears and shows like a locked profile .,1
"Lost all of my photos!!! I had deactivated my account for about 2 months to take a break from social media and when I logged back in, all of my photos and highlights were gone! I tried contacting Instagram multiple times with zero responses or attempts to help me out. It's unfortunate how little Instagram cares about it's users üëéüèº",1
"Past a week am not getting any feeds, the story was not opening, and having many glitches,after updating it's getting worse to use this app. Although I uninstalled and installed but there is no use using this application.. am unable post anything.eveything in this is buffering all time. Even though help setting is not working",1
"Pathetic! I tried to post a reel and it freezes in-between. Audio continues. I did it mutiple times. Even after re-installing for multiple times, it is not working. After one re-install it stopped showing reels option. The interface changed to the time when there were no reels. So many bugs.",1
"I had Uninstalled the app, Later when I reinstalled, it wasn't loading any reels, status etc. I was thinking it would be a network error but it's not that. Even after multiple del-install it is still the same It's quite annoying.",1
"If i could rate it lower i think i would. Genuinely, this app has gone downhill the second they added reels, everything after that has been useless and damaging the reach of the communities i'm in, please go back to videos being normal posts instead of reels, i am desperate!",1
"I used to use Instagram all the time for both work and entertainment purposes. Lately it's becoming extremely buggy...i can't open view once videos, messages sometimes are not sent till you get out of the app and get in once again. Lately, my feed is stuck and doesn't refresh at all which makes the app useless for me. Please fix the app as we're losing loyalty towards IG.",1
"It's too buggy, doesn't let me add several photos on to the same post without crashing or cutting photos as previous people have said. Fix it up or sadly will have to move away from this app.",1
"Just downloaded this app and am shocked with how much is malfunctioning. For an app with this much history and resources, I'm baffled as to why these issues exist. Cannot type a response without the keyboard covering text, even a floating keyboard causes text to be hidden under the grayed out toolbar that should disappear. Then even attempting to change a username launches a black screen with black text, making that feature useless. Why? These are such obvious mistakes that should never exist.",1
"So my main account stopped working completely. When I try to go to the help center it doesn't load anything, I've tried all troubleshooting methods I can think of. And Instagram doesn't have a way you can contact support/help through email or phone, so I haven't been able to get on my main account. It could be that my account has been disabled, but I haven't gotten an email/message of any kind. The app is trash.",1
"So many glitches - a new one with every update. After the most recent, only the first photo in a carousel post can be adjusted (color, filter, etc). Whenever I try creating a reel in the app - using the voiceover and other options, it fails to upload or it renders upside down. The only way I can create a reel is in a 3rd party app like Inshot and then upload to Instagram.",1
"I just updated this garbage app that I choose to waste so much of my time on. I hate that I have to fight so hard with this app to create content for someone else to profit off of and they cannot even put out a product that makes doing so less stressful. I'm trying to make you money by creating content for you, and you cannot even provide a product that will post our content without automatically cropping and distorting our pictures. Why does your product not work?",1
"Edit (downgrading it from 5 to 1 star): now a days Instagram app has become useless. Despite having superfast broadband wifi connection it has become slow. I have superfast broadband wifi connection. Other apps are working well. Instagram is also working with it. But tried uploading the reel & story. It's taking more time (almost 4 hours have passed, but it neither get uploaded nor show any error message). The video size is just 10 mb.",1
"Horrible. Been spending 5 years on this app and it doesn't seem to be getting any better. Rigged my mindset, changed my social behavior, made me unhappy - just plain trash. Another problem that I've been having with this app is being unable to log into one of my old accounts that I forgot my password to. Help center is trash, the people are trash, everything about this app is trash. Deleting.",1
"every time i open this app the feed refreshes after a second or two. just enough for me to recognize the post and be in the middle of reading it before 20 other posts load and i have to scroll to find and finish interacting with it. sometimes i will be reading a post in the middle of a scroll session and the feed updates and i get sent back to the top. if you come here to catch up or connect, you're in for a terrible time. only consuming, posting, commenting allowed.",1
"What is going on with all the glitches and bugs?!!! I uploaded 26 drafts to post in the New Year and every time I tried to post one it said ""Photo cannot be posted"". My app is up to date and I could post then & there, but all of my drafts were useless. Super frustrating. Now it's glitched on my main screen and every draft I tried to post is stuck sitting there with the ""cannot post"" notification. App needs work!",1
"I got an email telling me last WE that my Instagram business email was changed, and since then I cannot access my account. I tried to recover and secure my account according to the help Center but so far, all recovery pages from the App keep telling me to try again in a few minutes (Android App) In the website, the UI crashes with ""feedback_required"" message error. This is really blocking!",1
"I'm so tired of everything on my feed turning white despite being in dark mode because instagram is so buggy. I can't read anything, I can't see anything, the text and background are all turned white. Half of the time I can't even get the app open because it crashes immediately. I'm surprised no one else has brought this up.",1
"notifications button replaced by a shopping bag. Really? Not a fan of the fat black font either. It's loud and harsh, adding to the new chaotic feel of the app. NB it has become impossible to edit text after posting a photo: the text field can't scroll and my phone's keyboard covers the text.",1
"It's very buggy, any time I try to post a photo it crops off the side and puts a weird white/black boarder on there and even if I edit them to move it, it just does it again. It's also trying desperately to be like tiktok. Just stop, it was a great platform before reels, just bring back the only photos posting.",1
I was trying to delete an old account that I no longer use or have a use for because I have created so many and to my knowledge the creators have made it impossible to delete an account from the app or even a browser on your phone and you have to log into a computer browser. I love using Instagram for my other accounts but due to being inconvenienced I'm leaving a terrible review. Fix it Instagram because I'm not the only person to experience this issue.,1
"Suddenly started facing alot of technical glitches. Already see status still appear in front as a new reel, saved drafts reel doesn't work properly after couple of days, unable to see some posts or tags. I was tagged in a post however I was completely unaware of it and only found out through my friends phone. Poor experience.",1
"I don't know what the hell Instagram is doing now a days it's being worst day by day, sometimes I couldn't upload the reels and reels is being glitch and then now after 2 days of updating my post it's not showing some of my pics in it and written as (couldn't load image, tape to refresh!) Like what the hell what's wrong with you guys who managing the Instagram!",1
"Photo editing breaks constantly in Android app, especially when there is more than one photo in the post. Too much emphasis on shopping and ads. Drafts do not work on the android app. They break after 1 day, only showing a grey square and a message ""error loading image"" when you try to delete it. Spam accounts are a huge issue, I get messages from spam accounts on my public account daily at this point. We need more protection from this kind of thing.",1
"A social media app that has trouble uploading photos and video. They're more focus posting tons of ads rather than fixing the errors with photos. Suggested posts sucks. If i wanna see stuff from ppl i dont know i would click on search or just download Tik tok. Now adding ads one users profiles when you scroll through their pictures. So if you think you just liked your friend's post, beware you might be liking an ads of someone of something else that might change the algorithm.",1
I don't know what happened to these application past from 2 days it's not working as properly. the application is loading it continuesly browsing even when I have a good network. I'm getting frustrated by these problem. please check and help on these. I only face these one I checked my friends app it's working fine problem is in my mobile. Please help on these tq,1
"Fix this app. This recent update did nothing. I'm trying to post another reel on the app using the post feature, since Reels only allow you to post a minute and a half long reels, but after I'm almost done posting, it just crashes. The reel isn't even that long, only four minutes and two seconds. What, is there a limit of how long the reels could be now by using the post feature? If so, than that's just rip off.",1
"Being pushed more and more to use reels when the reel editor is so buggy. Synced music does not work. Saved audio don't always save, wasting so much time as you have to use trending audio to have even a remote chance of your content being seen. Reel polls give you no option to view votes or see who voted. The list goes on. Just bad.",1
"The worst developed app ever! I was editing my post photos before publishing and all the edits were gone after the post appeared! The images were incorrectly positioned, one of them even had a vertical white bar on the side! On top of that everything was lagging when I was selecting photos to post...",1
why is your name Instagram. Change the name to bugstagram. If can't handle app stop running it. It will be more useful. I can't see message what people sent. It takes me a day or more to receive messages. I can't add people to my group. Everytime I try to add it just gets stuck with everything blank. To add one person have to close and open insta 10 times. And guess what we can't remove them. This option is useless now. I can't remove people from my own group.09/10/2022 I am just fed up of this.,1
"The app isn't what it it used to be. Barely see my followers' content anymore. Posts are not in chronological order like it was when the app first came out. You're scrolling to see random people who you don't follow posts and their paid advertisements. At this point, tik tok should be your go to for an all-around enjoyable app.",1
It is impossible to upload multiple photos from albums on my phone. When I want to upload multiple things at once it's much easier to select them beforehand but I can only select from all of the photos if I want to post multiple things. When I take multiple photos of the same thing this becomes very tedious to find what photos I want inside the Instagram app.,1
"Worsens photos on stories. It's been 9th time already, and all my photo gets blurry, when it was taken in 3024x4032. Ok, if it decreases to 1080p, but it decreases to 720p, my friends with iPhone posts same quality, it stays on that quality and never decreases. And it's buggy af, It glitched and lagged several times and just closes right in front of my eyes, hate it. Until you won't fix it, it will remain 1 star'd. Worst app experience I've had.",1
"This app has the worst user experience compared to many other social media apps. Uploading pictures to posts, stories, reel is such an extreme sport and the unnecessary variety of options provided when trying to achieve a goal with the app can be very overwhelming. Are you guys making life easier for people or y'all intentionally making it difficult",1
"The latest update is so insanely buggy. When I go to view a message, I have to reload the page to see an entire timeline of the conversation because the messages don't load anymore, or the newest one will but none of the conversation will load except that one message. There are so many other chat bugs as well, making it annoying to talk to people. The forced reels are insanely annoying, it makes me not want to even scroll my feed anymore.",1
"It's amazing how the developer team manages to mess up functions that have worked for years, just to fix that issue in the next update while screwing something else up. That's one way to stay relevant I guess.",1
"Keeps kicking me out of the application. Cleared cache, restarted phone, did everything that I could. Still, nothing's changing. Fix this immediately. Edit (02/11/2022): that got fixed. Now, the issue is me not getting my texts at all. Whenever that I try to refresh the dms to see my new texts (since I get them as notifications only) nothing works. The loading circle keeps on going in a loop and it never refreshes. Fix this as well or you might not see me as your user again.",1
"I've been frustrated for months by this app trying to create a new account. Stuck in a page that tells me to create a username for a new account whereas, everything i try keeps telling me ""can't be used"" or ""invalid"". I need help. I can't continue trying only to end up not getting results. It'd madly frustrating. What's the issue? Is it from my side or from the application? Because I'm confused and frustrated already. If it weren't for the app opening, it doesn't even deserve a star.",1
"Horrible, when I upload a video to a Reel or just on my IG, the video comes up, upside down. When I try to fix it, editing my video to upside down, it becomes backwards. This is the first time I have experienced this. I hope to get it fix ASAP. My buddy said this happen to him and it took 1 year before it started working again. Hope that's not the case.",1
"This was one of my most favorite apps but a couple of days back my Instagram explore page was reset on it's own and now I cannot find anything of my interest. I had worked so hard to curate it but it just disappeared overnight. I have tried uninstalling, reinstalling, logging out, logging in back again and everything. Extremely disappointed.",1
"Completely stopped connecting to the internet. Every other app is fine. Whether I use wifi or mobile data, nothing would load. When I uninstalled to see if that'd fix it, it wouldn't let me login. I have my login info correct, but I'm locked out. It just says there's a network error. Guess I just lost the account I've had for 3 years because your platform is unreliable. Got it to work again but now my account with absolutely nothing that could violate TOS has been suspended. Love that",1
"Worst service, worst app. Can't even go to explain that I am facing in app. Can't surf reels, can't upload reels, can't see feeds, not even I can see messages. I tried to go on help centre but it's just showing surfing only. Need genuine solution.",1
"It's 2021 and one of the biggest apps in the world still doesn't scale properly to different display sizes. Absolutely ridiculous. But at least they keep adding features no one asked for that are direct rip offs from other platforms. Great stuff. Edit: it's now almost 2023 and this app STILL doesn't scale to different display sizes. Keep pumping those ""information not provided by developer"" updates though. You're doing great.",1
"Does anyone actually reply to the emails? The app is so buggy! It won't load and won't let me add to my stories. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling. I've tried restarting my phone. Almost all my other apps work fine, except My Fitness Pal. My internet is stable, a fibre line that works well, speed test says it's fast, like normal. I don't know what else to do. Please help?",1
"I've recently got a big problem with instagram and it's driving me crazy. I've sent several reports of my instagram bug. The past 4 months I can't open my own highlights or add stories to the highlight, and it's only one highlight that does this. So I deleted the highlight and created a new one and it does excatly the same. This seriously got to be fixed. On my home page I don't have the plus button net to like and messages where you can and stories, posts, reels etc.",1
"-can't view posts bc itrefreshes too often -Can't mute a video sends me to full screen. -ANYTIME I delete a follow request an error message comes up saying that it couldn't delete it -Automatically refreshes without warning sending me to the top of the screen in the middle of watching a video Reels has ruined Instagram, Meta should make a tik tok type app for that",1
"I wish the Developers would stop adding things we don't need and fix the problems that are still here after months. I have to refresh messages multiple times or else I miss stuff or conversations with friends come stay completely hidden unless I look them up manually. I have to refresh the app all the time and every time there's an update, which is very frequent, I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it. Every. Time.",1
"The functionality for editing multiple photos is completely broken. It duplicates/overwrites photos after you finish editing one, and most of the time you just lose all your editing, it reverts back to the original image and all the edit tools become non-functional. So many bugs, totally dead app. Well done Facebook/Meta, dead company.",1
"I have had issues with my videos posting to my business page upside down for months now, I've sent so many problem reports to Instagram, but the problem persists. I've done everything possible, cleared cache and data, uninstall and reinstalled, turned phone on and off so many times. Even now, I try to video with phone held correct way up, but still the videos appear upside down! There is just no one to help if you have a problem like this, I've had this issue for about 5 to 6 months now. üòî",1
"Endless ads, getting worse every few months. Frequent problems with stories and posts not uploading correctly, especially longer videos (all within the limits and file types) that leaves much to be desired.",1
"Instagram worked for years, I had no issues but then about 5 months ago something happened now I can't access my account, it just pops up saying ""couldn't refresh feed"" it says this on all pages, feed, messages, search etc. I resorted to making a new account that works fine but I'd like to be able to use my old account again but it seems that i might not be able to. Edit: after changing my password 3 or 4 times I was able to get back into my account but I'd like to know why this happened.",1
"I've updated this so many times, Uninstalled-installed, yet it doesn't give me the option to reply to a specific text or react to texts, nor it gives me option to change themes. So many glitchs, it does send me notifications but doesn't show messages in the chat, hangs often. Don't blame my internet, it's good. And, it randomly just brings me to my home page. Please fix this as soon as possible.",1
"I don't have access to the phone number which is linked to my profile and hence i opted for the video selfie method for my identity confirmation when instagram requested me to. Now, they aren't even able to confirm it (they e-mailed me about it). I'm highly dissatisfied as I'm not able to log into my account. If I don't get access to my account soon I'm probably going to stop using instagram.",1
"This app has lots of bugs. Give Instagram to programmers in Telegram (app) team, they will solve all the issues just in three updates. It's getting worse every day. Archives cannot be deleted in batches. And after an hour of deleting the archive, everything will return to its place. There is no possibility to watch just a short part of a video. It is full of problems and errors.",1
"The last 3 weeks, I no longer have a ""news feed"" all Im aloud to view are 4 random reels each day. I've done everything multiple times to fix the issue and nothing helps. From a user standpoint, it's very annoying and makes me want to get rid of the app. Unfortunately there is nothing to replace if at the moment.",1
"So irritating with this App. 2 hours i waited for posting my reel but every time its just show loading screen but can't upload it and when atlast its done then music isn't available on that video , so frustrated i am with this bug or whatever application issue is this?",1
"Ruins my pictures by cropping them randomly after posting, doesn't crop videos or pictures properly, posts im trying to watch or read will randomly disappear in the middle of watching it, and the app delays showing my ""likes"" and notifications till 30m-1h later after their real time, for some reason",1
Many bugs popping up in the recent times. Chat feature isn't working properly. Reply to a story is going as repeated message multiple times. Issue with app notifications. Could be an issue with some update. I could see many similar issues in the reviews. Take a check and hope to see the app working smoothly soon.,1
Have been unable to view posts for days. Refreshing does nothing. Freezes constantly. If I try to upload pictures it sometimes deletes my post before it uploads. Whole App is full of reels and adverts. Rarely see anything of friends or liked posts nowadays. Was going to uninstall and reinstall app but after reading others reviews I dont think I will bother! Disappointing and frustrating as used to be ok.,1
I'm just fed up beyond anything with the small bugs in the app. The app shows up weird in light and dark theme. Second of all I have not been able to access my stories archive AND edit my highlights coz the stories won't show at all. It just doesn't load my stories and the app crashes and shuts down. It's been more than a month facing this particular problem. Even reporting the issue multiple times doesn't help because I NEVER receive any reply.,1
I love instagram. Usually. Now its super glitchy. My dms never work. They wont load properly or disappear. Theres a report toggle which u report any issue. But theres no way to see what you reported or the status on it. There is no true customer service for these issues atm which is very upsetting. No email. No chat. Nothing. Very frustrating. especially when i see message notifications and can see none of them. Update:Spent over 1month w glitchy dm. No help. no access to new notes feature.,1
"Switch to a professional account application on Android encountered bugs often and many times. For example, the chat is completely messed up. Many times the chat disappeared. Please fix this bug. Otherwise switch to ios.",1
"Instagram is getting worse and worse. It has really gone downhill. The algorithm makes no sense, half the content I see is from accounts I don't even follow, everytime you learn how to use the new version they change it again, not to mention the glitches are endless. I haven't even been able to post a picture properly for weeks, which is the whole point of the app! I'm about to delete my account and uninstall.",1
"Absolute trash. Experience is extremely annoying. There are so many random bugs and glitches in every corner of this app. Instead of pointless updates, developers should initialise fixing the uncountable issues. The newly registered accounts lack so many messaging features, that's it useless to chat on this app for them. Only accounts older than an year or so have usual messaging features. This app literally feels like a newly released, cheap bug filled thing made by a bunch of amateurs.",1
New update in instagram is totally unbearable. 1. In story you cannot be able to use music. What the hell !!!! üòí 2. When you swipe left Reel option gone and you guys plugged options in top left corner which is totally wrongüôÑ. Making reel with just Left swipe is too easy and comfortable. Totally mood off and unexpected changes. üëéüëéüëé,1
Worst app for reels or video editing. Keeps crashing even for smallest duration reel editing. If you want to edit video clips and adjust duration or anything you just can't do it because this app is useless in that area. It shows that edit function but doesn't work. Instead of add other useless features like notes can't you first fix these bugs in your major features like reels?,1
"The platform has nose-dived in quality over the years. Bugs are all over the place, particularly in the discover feed, comment sections, and the top panel menu (that will randomly disappear, leaving you unable to check your notifications or chats). Making a new account is a total nightmare, which is odd considering how many bots there are on the platform now.",1
"It is a tremendous hassle and struggle to upload images on this app without them being cropped. I'm always having to struggle to figure out some kind of fix so that either the full image is displayed, or a viewer can scroll through different parts of it and see everything. This should not have to be an issue, ridiculous!",1
"The past month I've been saving Live Stories from my archives without issue. But this past week, my app now freezes on the Loading screen every time I try to save a Story. I've tried reinstalling my app, restarting my phone, and logging in/out of my account, still having this issue. I went back to old Live Stories I saved previously and they're having the same issue now too...",1
"I'll be notified when I've received a new message but when I check I don't see it so I have to refresh my messages more than once to see it. Also have opened videos but it still shows as unview. My explore page, for some reason it refreshed itself & now everything is nature. It has been like this for a few weeks. Another is videos & pics using the insta camera, it will either turn black or not be able to capture the whole video. There's more issues just please fix it. Insta use to work better.",1
"Would get notifications for messages, yet when I opened the app they would not show up. A quick work around I figured out was to log out then log back in. That worked, until recently I can no longer log back in due to ""sorry, there was a problem with your request"". Changing the password doesn't work, and I can't log in outside of the app either. Very frustrating.",1
"User experience is trash. Tries to pass off ""Sponsored"" accounts as though they're followed, and the number of those is ever increasing. Random auto refresh loses my place b/c posts never show up in a consistent order. Lost posts b/c of that, and I better hope I don't like the first post that shows up when I first open or resume the app, b/c there is never enough time to bookmark it or identify meaningful info to try to find it again, which I can do 50% of the time, if I have an hour to scroll.",1
"Used to be my favorite app, but now it's my least. I don't see my friends' posts and they don't see mine. It's just ads and reels. I miss it being a picture app and not a wannabe TikTok. What was wrong with the original app being pictures & chronological order. I do enjoy the stories option thought. Overall it's just become too much about pushing ads and not about the users experience.",1
Keeps telling me to update business website but won't let me. No one will answer my emails. Now I can't even post anything. üò° This was never fixed but wanted to add that they have gone ad crazy. I see more ads and recommendations than the actual pages I follow. Even double ads in stories. WTH! Also add an option to stop getting notifications about story posts. I don't care! But if I adjust anything I stop getting message notifications.,1
"Needs a serious update in many areas, need to allow more than 10 pictures to be uploaded at a time, and then after you try to upload pictures it takes forever to go to the next screen. Alot of scam profiles and scammers on there. I want to do more than just love a picture and be able to make a status without having a picture.",1
"This app tends to randomly log you out of your account, refuse to accept your password, then when you follow the prompts to reset your password it never sends the reset code whether it's via your email or SMS. IF you are lucky enough to get a reset code, the app won't accept the password reset. It'll come up ""something went wrong"" every single time. I've had this happen with multiple devices. You will NEVER get a response from customer service if you try to go through that channel as well.",1
"The developers need to do better in terms of os compatibility of features. The iOS gets features over features while the android os is left behind to sit and watch. This is the only app that gives this kind of user experience. Don't keep rolling out new features to only certain devices while you don't even work on the previous rolled out features for others. Stereo vs. Mono reel audio, new story features and so many more such differences that make using this app very annoying.",1
"My stories stopped working and no matter what I do I can't post, it says it's loading but when I open it minutes later nothing has been posted. And I agree that there are also too many ads and suggested posts nowadays gumming up my feed. I don't mind a few recommendations every now and again, after all that's how people get discovered but when there's almost nothing but ads and recommended accounts/posts it gets super annoying and hard to keep up with the people I actually follow!",1
"I was automatically logged out while using the app. When I tried to log in again, it said my password was wrong. Thinking I might have been hacked, I immediately tried to reset my password. After clicking on the link in the email they sent, I'm asked for my phone number (?). When I enter it and hit NEXT, nothing happens. So I'm locked out of my account, the password reset is broken, and the only option Instagram offers for reporting the problem requires accessing an inaccessible part of the app.",1
"I used to really like this app, not anymore. The reels are extremely annoying (if I wanted short videos, I would've went to TikTok), the ads are tenfold, and the analytics prioritize accounts as it seems fit while hiding posts from accounts I actually want to see (it should go back to order of being posted, not this data mining order that I had no say on). It gets worse. I can't even post more than one pic without the app crashing, literally every time. It's becoming usuable at this point.",1
"It's been months and I don't know why my account is STILL partially disabled. I've reached out multiple times and have yet to get a reply from a person. I have had 2 automated emails apologizing and stating my account was accidentally disabled but certain features are still unavailable. I can't run ads and do not have access to edit my profile. What is going on?? The help center won't even accept messages any more, keeps displaying a ""problem with this feature"" screen.",1
"12/29/22 update : suggested posts really ruins the app, mostly because the algorithm sucks, and the frequency of these posts is too much. Yes, you can mute them for 30 days, but it would be better if it was something that could be tweaked by the user to see things I am actually interested in. So, by the third one I just close the app, and don't return for weeks.",1
"What can I say? It's buggy as hell. It refuses to load content. It removes comments, likes, messages, and follows (or doesn't allow them to go through in the first place). It's frustrating to use. It won't play reels, when it does the sound doesn't work half the time. Videos in the messages won't play. I'm using a new phone with excellent internet. Also, the moderation is ATROCIOUS. Reported fake or harmful accounts/content doesn't get taken down and harmless accounts/content are removed. FIX IT",1
All of a sudden the app is posting images that are NOT the same as they look in the edit screen. It's putting random white space on the sides and more. Ridiculikulously bad UI. Truly awful. Oh and now it won't let me add music to posts or stories. What a crock.,1
"There is so much to dislike about Instagram I don't even know where to begin. Somehow I feel as if I have to use it because of my business. But all this really does is annoy me. This app is singlehandedly responsible for the plague of square photography to the detriment of landscape orientation. To make matters worse, it's impossible to enlarge a picture without it springing back to tiny. What a pox upon visual esthetics. Also, the messaging system is a joke. Also, get off my lawn.",1
They ruined it. The algorithm has been a disaster and I almost see more ads and recommendations in my feed than people I follow. I wish they'd change it back to about two years ago. Also the most recent update moved buttons around. Please move them back on Android. You keep making this app worse with every change Update: the new chat /messaging page is awful. Nobody needs the status bubbles. I want to see more of my contacts online across the top,1
"By worst Instagram has ever been. So many glitches, so many problems. Of course algorithm causing problems, low engagement, then the dm's are glitchie out of order until you refresh. It keeps freezing and getting kicked out and yesterday the search feed froze and when it refreshed it gave me pictures of nature and architectural pictures. Soon after o noticed all my feeds was out of order. It would randomly start with old post, new, old, very old and so on. Not sure if I'm banned. Very annoying",1
"I can't keep up with what my friends are posting because my feed is full of so many damn ads and suggestions, it's beyond ridiculous! I keep seeing the same stuff, over and over. It just makes me want to switch off. And the video quality is shockingly bad! I hate the way it cuts down photos. I also find that suddenly I'm following a page I've never seen before or followed before. WTH?!",1
"All good except some really stupid flaws. Why doesn't Instagram auto detect the location from the location data embedded in the photos? One of the biggest annoyances are spam comments, especially those asking to invest in crypto. It's absolutely ridiculous. Also why can't I see sensitive content if I want to! And it doesn't allow selecting files from Google Photos & Files app. That's a serious headache. Also, why not allow links to be clicked??! Shows ""video cannot be posted"". What's the reason?",1
"Currently has issues uploading multiple photos into one post. Errors appear, some of the photos get cut in half with a black background, forced zoom in when they're not supposed to. Takes a lot of time to fix, have to try multiple times to get all the photos perfect before posting. It used to not be this hard.",1
"The app is not working at all, When I try to login via Facebook, it's saying something went wrong. When I login with username and password, it is logging in, and for next 10-15 second it works fine, and after that it does not load anything. Not at all. 0kbps internet speed is consumed. Anyhow, Instagram lite is working fine. Please look into this issue.",1
"if I could give it a zero, I would. reels are absolute garbage. so much time wasted on a reel that previews perfectly then posts with messed up text, stretched out video, timing issues. seems to get worse with each update. I should just stick to TikTok. views and engagement on reels are garbage even with trending audio. photos don't get any reach either. really fed up with Instagram!",1
"I don't know what's happened to this app but months after posting, some of my multiples posts have been resized and zoomed in horribly. Thanks for randomly cutting off my children and husband's faces in my family portraits that were posted a while back - it was definitely not like that before. Un/reinstalled, rebooted, delete and restore the post, nothing changes it and it looks awful.",1
"Worst of any of the apps I use. Spammed now over a year. I've wrote probably over a dozen complaints, concerns and suggestions to no adjustments. I get the system automated ""thank you"" response, but absolutely nothing's changed. I have two different pages do to a few years ago when the ""life hack"" started on that app I'd just close one out and go to the other. Now both are as they call it. ""Life hacked"" with one spammed with mountains and baby pages. The other escorts from Africa.",1
"This app refuses to work smoothly without bugs. There is always something wrong with the call feature, and it's lack of being able to use any sort of headphones to have as a media output, when the headphones work fine for other services on the phone. This app used to be really fun, and now it's just a nightmare to traverse.",1
"For the love of god, please fix the photo editing and saving features! I can't rotate and position a photo without it reverting; can't edit more than two photos; can't save posted photos as they appear on the app (they are no longer cropped). It's been like this for months! It's so aggravating. Thank you.",1
"This app used to be amazing but in the last year it has gone down the drain. It crashes all the time, it automatically refreshes the news feed while you're looking at it so you lose what you were looking at. The amount of fake profiles is ridiculous as well and the fact that they do nothing about the profiles.or.bugs just shows that this and Facebook are going to crash and burn soon.",1
"I keep reporting that my instagram page hasn't refreshed in several days, and no one has reached out to offer help on the app. I've uninstalled/reinstalled, gone to the website to try and outsmart it, restarted my phone repeatedly, cleared my cache, and sent in multiple bug reports. Still nothing. This has never happened before. Somebody PLEASE HELP!",1
"There's something obviously wrong with the current state of the app. I Recently had to change and saved my password 5 times and with all this effort the app keeps logging me out. A reel I recently worked on can't be shared because of ""copyright"" after using music that was provided in the app. Creating reels are also an issue, as I would experience constant crashes while trying just add music or shorten a clip. The switch in account settings to share reels and photos at the best quality is useles",1
"I've held off writing a review for a while, but the same issues continue piling on. I primarily use the video feature, more specifically in chats, and the latest bug sends the video without any audio. Other times while making a video, the app will either slow down to the point of being unusable, or just close completely. Then there's the features that continue disappearing. I can no longer rewatch the videos I send, and I can't even save my videos with any audio, let alone at all.",1
"Very frustrating trying to post multiple pictures. I'll edit a couple and crop them the way I want, but then I post, and they are cut off in the wrong areas! So, I delete and start the process again only to have it mess up again! It doesn't save my progress, and it is also very glitchy as I am editing my post. Also, they need to find an easier way to make posts fit the standard phone camera ratios/resolutions so there isn't a need to crop and edit so much.",1
"I used to love this app and it has always been my favorite, but of late it's become ""buggy"" and has glitches. I've cleared the caches, uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times. It gets better for a about an hour and then starts to close unexpectedly along with freezing up. I can't see some reels because of lines going across the video screen. My tablet is brand new too, so I don't know what else to do. I wished they get it fixed. Thinking of going to Tik Tok if it doesn't get worked out soon.",1
"Have tried multiple times to post one time with multiple pictures. Every time, the app crashes. And sometimes it freezes, too, and then when I can use it again, my pictures have posted and I have to delete the post and start all over again, because the app won't let you edit pictures once they're posted. For such a popular app, it's a shame that it's so terrible.",1
"Anytime I save something the ""saved to collection"" thing will not go down getting in the way of images I'd like to see. Not just that I have been having problems with notifications never working right as in never coming in or coming in days later. Tons of bots and nothing done about them, or too many to do anything about them. slightly annoying but you get over it.",1
"Photos keep cropping by themselves, no one wants to fix it, it has been weeks or months now. You can see white strips on the sides of most if not all of my photos. I'm up-to-date on software and have cleared my cache. Hoping this is enough for someone to do something about it, I've sent so many reports by shaking my phone and nothing has gotten done about it. Sick of ruining my photos.",1
"This app is good for everything except what it's supposed to do. I edit and get ready to upload pics, and the app force closes. I put 10 pics in the que to edit, and after editing, all of the pics are the same photo. Uploading sometimes is distorted and warped. Framing is never the same. After spending time working on photos, the app doesn't even recognize the edits. There is no excuse for one of the top rated social media platforms to have all of these problems.",1
"This app is awful. It's constantly buggy and ruining my posts. Sometimes it will distort pictures after I post them. It only posts correctly half of the time. Sometimes it doesn't show the option to upload a reel. Sometimes the reel I'm uploading doesn't load at all, and since there is no way to cancel the upload, the only way I have found to stop it is to uninstall the app. Other times, the upload icon is in a different place. Sometimes I can edit photos at all",1
"I'm uploading videos in high quality (1080p) but Instagram keeps compressing them and they post blurred. I already watched several YouTube tutorials and the ""high quality video"" toggle switch that's supposed to be in my ""account"" section isn't there. Really disappointing. Not good for a platform that was supposed to be about photo and video sharing. It's most especially disfunctional since they're pushing ""Reels"" now instead of having the option of just being able to post a simple video.",1
"Normally I'd give this app a 5-star review, but in the past month, Instagram has been extremely buggy. Messages I send from my account on one device don't sync with my other device, or just randomly disappear altogether. I had this problem again today and assumed this was just a little blip, so I restarted my phone, logged out and back in, uninstalled and reinstalled Instagram, and then my messages disappeared. I can't send any messages either, and when I try to refresh, it just loads endlessly.",1
"So, it seems I'm not the only one receiving this issue. Instagram has a bad habit of not notifying me of any messages, and any attempts to refresh or even closing and opening the app does nothing to even let me see new messages, regardless of how many times I do it. It even seemed to have removed me from my partner's list, and vice versa for him, which is completely weird cause he and I did not remove each other, whether it was accidental or purposely. This app has been glitching out lately.",1
"For some reason unless I'm in the app I no longer get dm notifications. I haven't changed any of my settings, I've updated & reinstalled & I am still having this issue. It has now devolved to the point where even if I'm in the app, WITH THE DM OPEN, messages from people will not come through until 10 minutes AFTER they've originally sent it. I've tested this with friends physically next to me so I know exactly when they send a message. Desktop works fine so there is something wrong with the app",1
"This is just a hollow shell of what it used to be. Edit; can't even look at liked post, the option was removed. I repeat my first statement. Edit; Can't record more than a couple seconds now, literally like 5 tops. It cancels the recording and starts replaying irregardless of me still trying to record. Confused why it still takes up space, I'll probably change that soon.",1
"Not great. This app is no longer allowing me to create any reels. It keeps crashing everytime I want to create one or even go into my home page. I've done everything they say to do, clear the cache, uninstalled, re installed, even went in and deleted a ton of reels and posts to free up space and archived another bunch and the app is still acting the same. I've been told this happens with IG after a while. Not sure what else to do at this point besides just start fresh with a different platform.",1
"Whenever I go back to home every thing refreshes and I can can't see the ""older post"". I go down press ""see older post"" but it only shows 2 or 3 post OR nothing at all, huh?! Also for some reason my private account and my public account are totally different. Using my public account is better because it doesn't feel controlled and I can swipe to see my messages. But still auto refreshes. They fixed the message swipe thing :) I would like to figure out how to unmute a profile tho I've checked set",1
"This app is only getting worse over time and since many people have complained of the bugs and constantly changing algorithm, I'm pretty sure the people behind Instagram just don't care. I want to use it to post art and connect with other people but it's just way too frustrating to use. The app has had numerous bugs, some of which prevent you from posting anything, and now the app is currently just crashing if I try to view anything. Too much of a glitchy mess, 1/5 until something improves.",1
Not the same. Use to notify me who's posting now I get zero notifications after looking at my settings as well as from the app. The settings are fine but nothing. I hate how zoomed in pictures are even after zooming out. I can't adjust color on videos that aren't reels without selecting a damn filter. So much has changed which was unnecessary. Go back to where it was 4 years ago.,1
"I really really REALLY wish the app would stop refreshing my timeline whenever I stop to read a post. After 5-10 seconds, whatever I'm looking at is pushed down and replaced by an Ad (sponsored post). It's very irritating. I could be in the middle of reading something or watching a video, then it's replaced by an Ad.",1
"Before, this app used to be my favorite. For some days, the app has not been working properly. I can't able to post videos or reels. When I'm selected to post, it is showing an error pop-up and automatically goes back to selecting page. And the app is hanging. I had cleared cache and data and reinstalled it 2 to 3 times. Please update the app and clear all problems in it.",1
App used to work. Since around when Facebook bought them certain features just don't work anymore. If I try and post more than 5 pictures it merged them together all blurry with a diagonal line through the middle. When I adjust photos so they are zoomed it works then disappears as soon as I edit a different picture in the set. That issue just started in the last month. Quality has dropped significantly,1
"Recent glitches and errors have made this app disappointing to use (what is the point of simply opening the app if I can't do the one thing it was designed to do: post a photo). For three days I haven't been able to post (it won't load the photo only a black square, and when it does it is blurry and glitches so badly that the app closes or the image dances around the screen). This app is getting exhausting to use, it's not fun anymore, and the glitches keep expanding with no fixes!",1
"Pathetic. Development of this app gets worse and worse. So many bugs, so many forced shopping tools, interface changes, bloat, etc. On top of all that the algorithm means only a tiny fraction of your audience sees your posts and vice versa. For a social media app, they've lost their way, and have simply allowed room for someone to do it better and take their business. Used to be about photography and sharing. It is anything but nowadays. I don't know anyone anywhere that thinks it isn't worse.",1
"Have been using this app for years. It has been awesome until last year, the problems occurred. Not sure what's going on. I've personal, private, and business accounts, public. My business account isn't working, the songs' choices are very limited, please fix it soonest. I need them to make amazing reels, contents. Updated each time, but still, after a year, still no progress, not working at all. Disappointed. Considering few times already to move to Tiktok. Please do fix it ASAP. Thanks.",1
"This app is getting worse and more buggy by the day... I'm not receiving my notifications and messages until DAYS after they were sent! The latest update has messed with the ability to make reels: I have been trying to create a 2022 year-at-a-glance for 2 days(!) and everytime I get about half way through choosing my photos, they all deselect! And it's back to square one. It is INFURIATING and such a waste of time! If they don't fix this site soon, it will become the next MySpace! ;)",1
"All notifications disappear if you open one of them. Videos get cropped in fullscreen. Why is the app worse now somehow. Videos don't play automatically, the mute button vanished, (of course the adverts have normal functionality). Videos freeze at random. The feed reloads at random so you can't find what you're looking at. The notifications still disappear. Why is it now worse, why does the save dialog appear on top of the subtitles and refuse to disappear?",1
"Everything was working fine until the new update. Now, Instagram doesn't even load. I'm stuck on a blank page with the loading icon. No matter how long I wait, nothing happens. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app, restarted my phone, switched between Wi-Fi and data, but nothing works. This issue is even more frustrating because I have a business account I need to maintain.",1
I wish Instagram can have a feature where you can edit your story without having to delete it and put pictures on your highlight without having to put them on your story. This app bugs so much its frustrating. It's so bad I wanna give you a zero but that's not possible so I give you a one.,1
"For months now, every time I open the app it refreshes the feed after a few seconds, replacing the posts I've not yet had a chance to look at with 'suggested posts' from accounts I don't even follow. If I happened to glimpse a post from a followed account I wanted to see, I have to manually navigate to that account. It's ridiculous. Given that it's been like this for months, I have to assume that it's intentional!",1
"Worst app ever, I've never seen so many bugs in my life. 1) Dark mode don't always apply correctly in every section of the app for example: the comments section is dark with black text on it so you cannot read 2) lately I cannot post a media from the gallery, i can only use the Instagram app 3) the user Interface keeps changing, am i a user or a social experiment? Stop changing the layout of the buttons (likes, shopping, reels ...) 4) and lastly make a Instagram premium subscription without ads",1
"One of the most broken apps I use. If you have multiple accounts, be prepared for inconsistent updates, disappearing features, and overall frustration. Not only is my app consistently broken (DMS won't load, my posts randomly glitch out, the photos became so low quality you can't even tell what it is, a laggy home page, and feature such as adding music to post disappear, if a post fails to post not being able to delete the message, etc) but they add pointless features that make it even worse too",1
"This app is just getting worse. Now the story save button is all buggy. When someone tags me in their story and I want to repost it the save button just disappears and I can't save it to my gallery. The music on stoy is still blocked in my region so the music on reels is also messy. And don't get me started on the favorite feed... I would like that IF my account would have it. My newly created account has it, but the main one doesn't. No reinstall or update helped so far.",1
"Very bad app. Firstly, it gives the feature of writing and sharing notes for many weeks and as soon as you use this feature then they unavailable this feature for you only. Many times I try to contact with support team but they don't reply. Too many bugs. If the app run in backgroud then it will spy on your camera and microphone. Not safe for children under 18. Privacy is the biggest problem.",1
"Too much bugs on every update of Instagram. Every time refresh my dm to see the messgaes, videos and reels only play audio and not the video most of the time and also most of the time it shows only thumbnail. Can't refresh my following to latest every time I refresh my following it only show default. If I save any post the pop up of save show continuosly until I click on the pop up and back to feed. Also facing story glitches. Can't react properly on message. Lag and crash problem. Too much bugs",1
Over the last few months editing and posting on the app has becoming increasingly difficult. The editing ability of the app has really deteriorated and glitches are very frequent. I normally wouldn't post but feel that it's important to highlight an increasingly annoying problem with an app that previously didn't have these problems.,1
"I used to use this app daily, but it's becoming harder and harder to find the people I follow amongst all the ads and random suggested posts. These days the feed consistently shows as blank, or briefly shows a friend's post before reloading and replacing it with an ad. I have to individually search out my friends to see if they've posted because they don't appear in my feed anymore.",1
"App was good untill they started drasticly changing it with updates. The reels are just an attempt to be like tik tok, it's losing its personality from it,but that not the main reason I'm giving it the one star. Recently instagram started recommending me stuff on explore I don't care about. I'm trying to tell the algorithm I don't want to see the posts by clicking the ""not interested"" button, but they keep popping back up.Cause ofreelsIcan'tsavethepoststotheother folder. I have more complaints..",1
"App is so broken! Messages don't refresh, discovery feed completely unusable (refresh don't show new content, plus to load more doesn't work half of the time. Tried to reinstall the app, it doesn't help. But the worse thing is algorithm. It made it pointless to post photos. In discovery feed algorithm keeps showing unwanted content that was specifically flagged ""I don't want to see this"" dozens, sometimes even hundreds of times.",1
"I don't know what's happened but over the last couple of days, it's been so unreliable for logging in (I get ""unknown network error "" message appear). There's nothing wrong with my Internet connection as I can access other websites, such as twitter without any problems. It's not the 1st time I've had problems with Instagram. I can't even log in using Google.",1
"This app is awful. If I didn't need it to run my business, I would honestly delete it. I can no longer post videos as a regular post, nor can I tag products in my post until after it has actually been posted. Stories glitch all the time changing fonts to caps or a whole different font altogether. Algorithms are trash. Instagram suggests I make my post a reel instead of a post because it is multiple photos and it gets about 50 views. Many more issues. Instagram, please fix your mess. Thanks.",1
Loads of bugs when uploading a video. Either turns it upside-down or minimizes to 1/4 of the screen. That is of course if it gets that far at all. Freezes in the creating process and app needs to be restarted to do anything. Used to be fine but more and more issues lately.,1
"The performance and usability decline continues. In a multi-image post, the app won't let me edit all images individually but keeps jumping back to the first image regardless of my selection. Only pre-set filters can be applied, however, then the app keeps crashing before posting. At least my feed is full of ads",1
"I hate my experience with Instagram right now. The algorithms are a total mess. Uploading a reel is now a heculean task. And to top it up, you can't not cancell the upload. It's literally stuck. You cannot switch accounts during the process either. The only forqward for you to continue using the app is to uninstall and relogin again. It's totally unfair and not a nice experience. And until this changes, it's a 1 ‚≠ê for me. This used to be my best app ü•≤",1
"It constantly freezes and causes system UI crashes that mean I have to restart my phone. I reckon about 70-80% of the time when I open the app it does this immediately, and then also often when it seems fine it suddenly does it when I click on anything like messages, or see comments etc. Have tried clearing the cache and uninstalling etc and nothing works. On a Samsung s22.",1
"1. Every now and then the app logs me out 2. The changing colour feature on location sticker stopped being an option for me 3. I get notifications for direct messages but when I open the app I have to refresh multiple times in order to read them because it seems as there are no new messages 4. Sometimes it takes forever for the stories to be shared 5. The ""sort by"" option on following/followers stopped working 6. More ads and reels than actual posts (it's bad!) PLEASE FIX! IT'S KINDA UPSETTING!",1
"I cannot stand that there is no way to limit or stop the auto refresh. Trying to catch up on your feed and automatically tells you a ""sorry pal I don't think so"". Takes what would have been an amazing experience and turns it into trash. Another thing is this Retardedly ran app Is majority Advertisements Instead of Feeding what you prefer to see. A bunch of Jack's.",1
"Love this app, but the new update is the worst thing ever! I'm sure that it's a mistake, but all my business profiles are are unlinked from their respective FB pages. When switching accounts, and sharing things to FB, I have to log into FB each time to switch the account I want to post to on FB. There should be an option for each Instagram profile to link to individual FB pages. Edit: It's 1 year later and still not fixed Edit: 2 years later - Can't edit any images without glitches. Terrible!",1
"Been having a lot of problems with notifications mainly - some showing up, some not, or showing up weeks later for no reason. Opening up comment notifications makes some comments invisible or out of order. And when trying to comment, my keyboard covers the type box so I can't see what I'm typing. It's been worse and worse with every update.",1
"Wish they left the app alone back early 2022. The new updated app of now is so frustrating to use to upload posted photos. When you edit a photo and go to the next pic, it doesn't save all the adjustments/ edits from the ones done, especially if you add another photo to the post. It also shows tackiness of the cropped adjusted balanced pic border in the post if you edit the pic & and refreshes the pics to start over. Its so annoying. Another reason why I've been limiting posting/using IG.",1
My network connection is good. All other apps are working completely fine. I can't access any reels or pics or stories in this app only but my account is working fine in Google Chrome. Worst app experience. You people are not even trying to fix the bugs. We keep on facing the same issue again and again.,1
"The algorithm makes me sick (no freedom to get rid of the homefeed). For many users no reply or ""like"" (like emojis) support in-chat. But the big bummer is the UI, they purposely designed it to make it harder to get to certain features, let alone the option to delete your account for years only been accessible online. This app is made to be addicting, it started off as an photographers app, those times are behind us, for years. The good? Ehm, it's not the app, it's you who does the work.",1
"Instagrams functionality gets worse and worse every single time they add a new feature to reels. It's clear to EVERYONE using the platform that it's for nothing but the monetisation of influencer accounts, and that it's getting closer to TikTok, without TikToks video editing benefits. The functionality of insta needs to be optimised before adding new things to it. For example, almost every time I make a reel, it freezes half way through the edit, insta shuts down, and my work is lost. Not a fan",1
I love the idea app keeps you connected to friends but I do believe it needs more controls. Support is lacking. My previous account was hacked and due to the process in place I was unable to regain access and seemed stuck in a never ending loop. Finally reported the old account when they tried to scam from it. This could all have been stopped if you bothered to employ more people and didn't rely on algorithms that do not work. Also poor control on taking down reported posts. Could do better,1
"The user experience has gone down significantly in the past 3-4 months, basic features are breaking down. The chat themes never seem to work, a solid color background, I have to refresh my DMs to get any, otherwise, it doesn't show that I have undread texts, random app crashes, etc. You guys seriously need to fix these issues before adding any new features to the app.",1
"Recently they released an update that completely messes with my ability to send any sort of video or picture. I've had to delete the app twice and relog into all of my accounts just to get rid of it doing this, because it wont let me swap accounts whilst uploading. Though I'll have to delete it again if I try to send another photo. My phone, and apps, are all up to date - so it's very obviously just how terrible this app is. Maybe oneday they'll get it right.",1
"It's not what it used to be. In posts with many pictures, it often shows the second picture first. When trying to sort the people I follow by ""Date followed: latest/earliest"", it doesn't show them as requested (solve this issue, please, it's been in the app for months!). The amount of RAM it takes is terrible, and it seems to get worse with each update, leading to lag and even for the app to stop working (unacceptable). DISASTER, LIKE ANY OTHER PRODUCT OF META/FACEBOOK.",1
"A 12 years old app that constantly crashes. I lost the count of how many times I lost my entire working while creating a reel. It's so buggy, the thumbnails are not correct, the app freezes, a couple of times it uploaded my reel upside down. It's easy to see why people are migrating to TikTok. I recently opened an account there and so far I didn't face any issues or bug when creating videos....",1
"Super glitchy and unstable app lately. If you click a link, the theme changes the background to white when you return to he app, but the writing stays white as well and becomes unreadable. It requires a full reboot each time. This happens on any device I use. Not to mention the constant freezing and crashing. Please fix these stability issues!!!!",1
"It has been glitching. Changes the font size when posting reels so they look bad. When I follow or like a picture it won't register the follow or like, even when doing it several times. Very annoying. When is this going to get fixed? I bet if Kim Kardashian complained about such a bug, they would have fixed it asap! I've sent twice now a report on the fact that I can't follow back account that are following me. If I press on the Follow back blue button - NOTHING HAPPENS! FIX IT",1
"So glitchy whenever I try to post. It randomly frames all the image and slows all the actions on my phone down massively. Countless times I have posted a post only to find it duplicated many of the images or cropped them stupidly. I have a decent phone that runs quickly with many things running yet posting to Instagram slows it down every time. I don't understand how Instagram, owned by Facebook, has managed to create such a badly maintained system with all the money involved.",1
"Can't post a multiple photo post anymore! Anytime trying to post with multiple photos when in the editor, other photos become off centre, if I correct it another one will move or the whole app crashes. I've tried for a week to post now but I'm completely unable to. I've deleted and reinstalled and it's still the same. Really disappointing that I've emailed support and had nothing back either. Looks like a wider issue than just me as other people are reporting the issue too.",1
Too many problems. I constantly edit a post and then an error message pops up and I lose it. If I come out of the app for a second or my phone locks then a post or story selection is lost / reset. Locations are often wrong or not spelled correctly and I cannot update them. A photo of me simply sitting in a gym was not allowed as it was 'inappropriate'. It was not but I could not dispute it. There are so many glitches and technical issues now it is impossible to use sometimes.,1
"Painful to upload pictures. Sometimes when carefully selecting and editing your pictures for a post to the feed, the app just crashes and you're left empty handed. When using square frames, IG tends to screw this up and on one side of the picture, there is an ugly white bar. Sometimes on the story when you use a location, the font is below the icon which makes it look ugly. Sometimes when you post the story, the picture stays on the screen after so you have to reopen.",1
"What is wrong with Instagram!!? When you try and post more than one photo in a post and edit the photos, it gets all glitchy and then either goes blank and you lose your selected photos or if you do finally get to post, all the photos go off centre or chopped off to one side! Very frustrating indeed! I guess it's trying to push people onto reels but not everyone wants to post a reel! Sort it out Instagram!!",1
"BRING BACK THE DRAWING FUNCTION ON STORIES, PLEASE! Plus, I can't count how many updates it has been and dark mode won't work properly on my phone. After looking at a few posts or profiles, it'll turn white and I can't read any text unless I tap on it. I'll also get notifications for messages that I either have to close and reopen the app to actually see them or they appear much much later.",1
"Please stop trying to be another app. Instagram was great, but now you've put so much effort into trying to be TikTok that the base functions of the app suck. The algorithm is so messed up, I can't see most new posts from people I follow. I have to specifically visit their pages one by one, or if they share the new post to their story I can see it there. Not in the feed at all. My feed stops short after like 15 posts & I get a pop-up ""You're all caught up!"" when I am definitely NOT caught up.",1
"Okay, I've updated the app after the messaging was buggy. Some of the bugs were not receiving the latest messages sent by someone, emoji reaction not working, and slide a text right to mention not working. Post update, it felt like I've downgraded the version to one that came years ago. Heck, I have to restart the app each time. Please fix this. Also, bring about a clean way to use ""insights.""",1
"Way too many ads and sponsored posts. It used to be maybe 1 ad for every 5 pics you scroll past, plus some in-between stories occasionally. Now you will open the app and the first thing at the top of your feed is an ad, and literally every other post as you scroll will be an ad or random reel. That's just ridiculous- can't stay on the app very long because of it. If you have to aggressively scroll past junk just to see the people you actually follow it's no longer fun to engage with.",1
"The app is freezing a lot, message notifications aren't instant you need to refresh the page everytime to see new ones. Don't get me started in reels- it hangs while adding or removing videos, audio or editing in general. 5 min job takes hours which shouldn't take that long. Impossible to change cover photo of highlights. The videos get inverted by itself while posting or the quality becomes degraded. Honestly the latest version has messed up the most important features.",1
"I hate that I started a business on this platform because I have to use this app. It is absolutely awful. Multiple restarts a day or else it doesn't work properly. Editing photos almost always warps and/or resets during posting. Reels and stories crash all the time. I have to edit my pics/vids with other apps before bringing into IG, which I shouldn't have to do. And it's not my phone or my version, this app's instability has been an issue for years; across multiple phones and updates. It sucks.",1
"Fix the scrolling in Explore! Get rid of the ""snap to"" scrolling and bring back smooth scrolling. Your obsession with reels makes it even worse. When you scroll a mix of images and reels, the reel will fill the screen and to comment, you have to scroll back and forth until you finally can see and hit the comment symbol. Smooth scrolling where you can position the reel or image anywhere is much nicer, you know like it used to be a long time ago before you added the ""feature"" and screwed it up.",1
"I'm getting so tired of re-making content that's already taken me hours, because there was an error and everything corrupted. Or straight up deleting drafts. Then when I do post a reel, 80% of the time it's glitchy or the music is messed up, or the cover image isnt lined up (AND CORRECTING IT MEANS RUINING THE ALGORITHM). I cannot change my highlight covers, the app crashes when I do. I'm done giving suggestions, just fix what you've given us already.",1
"Absolutely horrible. Posting reels is just a nightmare. I would have everything perfect - text, timing, fonts, clips, pictures, and audio's then when i post it or save it it all gets jumbled, not to mention when saving drafts it looses the audio. Also when posting to regular feed the photos will come out weird with half of them missing. Creating and editing highlights barely works it just loads forever and doesnt accomplish anything. Overall a very glitchy app with way too many bugs.",1
"The most convoluted process to log back in. After getting a new phone it says that there is an error with my email and password (which are saved). Two factor authentication was never set up so when I try to access my account via the ""Get Support"" route the app crashes and it kicks me out. Even after deleting and re installing the app and changing my password more than enough times it is impossible to access my account. So infuriating that there isn't a way to contact anyone via email or phone.",1
"Can't post photos to story on S22Ultra. Newest firmware and app version. When trying to upload photos to story nothing but a blurred background appears. Nothing will load to edit and post. When I click post anyways, it posts the photos sideways and very very distorted. Not very useful. Absolutely frustrating controls to post REELS or Stories. What am awful jumbled app. Constantly not working/ can't insert audio etc etc etc you name it, the app will screw it up. They're clearly not bothered.",1
"This app is making instagram unusable for me. Sometimes it skips through stories too quickly without any user input and sometimes it freezes on the story and I have to force quit the app. When I select multiple photos to post, the app becomes extremely glitchy as I get to adding 10 photos. With videos, it won't allow me to see the video before posting. When I am done editing a post, one photo blinks on/off before going to the caption screen, and the photos are distorted and/or blurry. Please fix",1
"No, you did the worst! Like if a specific filter is being applied during video call on instagram and suddenly when a reel is being shared over it, the filter applied disappears immediately! What the heck! It wasn't like that before. The filters remained as it is no matter what was being played or shared over it. Look into it.",1
"The number of new bugs with each update is atrocious. Everytime I sort my following by latest, the page just refreshes and shows me the default order of sorting. The reels randomly stop playing. When I rewatch a reel, only the audio plays and the video is stuck at the thumbnail. I cannot refresh my profile. The note feature has been disabled for one of my accounts. Just fix the bugs before rolling out new features that no one asked for with each update.",1
"This app is pissing me off. Messaging is constantly delaying for a day and I'm missing messages that are very important. I've tried uninstalling and re-installing a number of times and still doing the same. Not reliable if your life depends on it. Also, video feeds stay the same when you click on a new video when you are watching one IG.",1
"Only reels of my friends show up on my main feed for the past 3 weeks, so I've been stuck with the same reel for 3 weeks on my feed. Please fix this. My friends still post photos but I can only see it if I switch feed view to ""following"". It's extremely annoying to be seeing the start of the same reel over and over again everytime I open the app. Also, discover page is full of reels only which is also annoying, I want to see photos more than videos if I open the app.",1
"Been months since I haven't been able to upload multiple photos without the photos being a copy of each other!!! A simple editing of one photo will cause it to multiply, removing the rest. Uninstalled, installed, restarted, all basic troubleshooting doesn't work. FIX IT. Update: it's fixed but now there's a new problem. Every time I reposition a photo while editing multiple photos, the photo gets back to the previous version as if I never made the edit. SOLVE IT PLEASE.",1
"Terrible loading experience, videos freeze midway, searching for your friends is a lost cause, dark mode is beyond glitched out, why even offer it? When uploading multiple photos to a post the app auto crops (off frame) and cancels edits. This app is falling apart and my phone is not old or out of date with the app store. Get your business in order Instagram!",1
"In my inbox, the video and images in the media in someone's chat would open but would not play, it would just turn black. And if I send something from my gallery to someone, that video would also be black and would not be played. üíîü§¨ü§¨üò†Because of which I am very worried. There is hatred. I tried to update the application again and again but to no avail Please do something about it.",1
Couldn't refresh feed shows up everytime i try to load new content..even the time i open instagram the homescreen shows no post...this app is basically full of bugs and glitches... also the messaging section shows no followers just blank page .....everytime i update the app...these problem occur I even decided to not use beta program but still in the normal versions same problem occur please resolve them soon,1
"Uploading photos is a gamble, sometimes it's working fine, other times my 5th photo will disappear or the first image will duplicate 10x. Trying to actually crop or edit photos can cause the whole thing to glitch out and stretch the photo. Sometimes the uploaded pics will look different than how they showed before. Also I really don't need to know 100x a week that xyz is on Instagram and I should follow them, no option to turn these off and makes it hard to see actual notifications",1
"The app doesn't show the recent people that I followed no matter how many times I use the ""Sort: Recent"" on the ""following"" list. It's getting extremely annoying that a simple function is still not fixed.",1
The music option hasn't been working since months and even after updating it's still not going away whenever I search for a song it doesn't show up but shows result not found I mean I only have access to a few songs and can't search for another song kindly resolve the issue.,1
After years of having an account with close to 22k likes...received temp block said You may have been phished Jan '22 - Verify identity - proved it was me. Received 2 password resets. Neither worked. Tried in March and they said too busy due to Covid try in future. This team was anonymous and didn't care. Tried few months later and said case closed & reapply. I reapplied to got sorry this channel doesn't deal with this anymore...go to help page. I tried again no response. They are the worst.,1
"Extremely horrendous video and image compression for reels and stories. Whenever I try to upload a video that's within the recommended file size, it still gets compressed to oblivion. I hate that so much. My phone is Samsung Note 9.",1
"It's very very slow. Even with high speed internet ~300mbps, it take lot of time to load the page. On the contrary, apps like YouTube and twitter load very fast, I can play 4k video smoothly on YouTube but not able to load a page in insta properly. Kindly improve this.",1
"Instagram AI is very very bad. Always show 18+ content only. Even I selected so many profile I'm not interested these revelant profile,video,reels etc... But still Instagram show 18+ content. If don't fix it. Then i quiet Instagram app. I don't want to see adult content on Instagram. Understand or not.",1
"Almost every 2 months I have to delete and install again because for some reason: photos and videos keep appearing as sending for like 2 days and somehow still not being sent, voice message record button just stops reacting on touch for some reason, phantom stories appear (phantom as in last story looks like something being posted, loading screen and it stays there). After installing everything goes back to normal. Why do I have to keep deleting and installing just so I can use it normally ‡≤†‚Å†_‚Å†‡≤†",1
"So many glitches that i am fed up of it. You cannot view people's profile cz it keeps switching between private public followed and non followed, even when I'm already following a person for like a month. Sometimes changes chat theme on it's own. Sometimes you cannot reactvto mssg, sometimes you can't reply to them. So many bugs",1
"Since the latest update it continuously crashes. It only stays open a few seconds each time I open it then it disappears and I'm back at the home screen of my phone ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I hope this gets fixed soon, this is my most used app for social media.",1
"I am getting so many bugs. Sometimes I see my chat input box goes below the visible screen & long press emojis goes at random place. Sometimes video posts pauses while audio continues. Today without update, I see two stories section, one on home page & one above chats(in place of notes). There are many frontend bugs I noticed. I asked my frnds if they're experiencing but no. Only I out of my friends am facing this issue. Even this is not device specific since I got same bugs in my older device.",1
"Instagram music collection disappeared. Only some kind of strange song. In search can't find any music at all. Use Instagram for many years, everything was fine, but from last months till now üòî Please fixed",1
"It was my favorite app for many years. But now it doesn't make any sense. I follow there not so mamy people, but recently I stopped seeing their posts and stories. At the same time I see other posts 3-5 times per day and a lot of recommendations, that I don't need. INSTEAD OF MY FRIENDS! ü§¨ Also my friends stopped seeing my pictures. What's the point of this app if friends and families can't follow each other? It became exactly the same senseless as Facebook.",1
"Unable to reset password. I Can receive every email from Instagram EXCEPT the password reset email which is very frustrating. I've spent 2 days attempting to get into my account. The help forum for Instagram is a joke, it doesn't help you do anything it only sends you into a perpetual loop, there is no way to get actual help from a human being (which would make password resetting ALOT easier). There is no way to contact META for direct assistance either. would give 0 stars if I could.",1
"Video editing in reels is Horse Sheet. I spent 2 hours editing and when I was ready to upload it, the app wouldn't let me. 'not yet posted, try posting again'. I did all the fixes. Clear cache app. Restart phone. Use my LTE. Log out and log back in. Updated the app. Finally out of desperation, I uninstalled and reinstalled the app.. now the video I edited is gone forever. It's not even in recently deleted. Absolute garbage",1
"I have had this app for more than 10 years and more and more problems keep coming, I was trying set up my shop, but the app bugged and closed on me, so I tried again and I no longer had the option to open a shop. It's always behind in my timeline and the sounds doesn't always work, the videos freeze constantly even with stable connection. Instagram please fix your problems because it's affecting you users gravely.",1
Another update which has multiple glitches in the system. Editing photos is a nightmare. Viewing hashtags by recent is a nightmare. Refreshing notifications is a nightmare. The bugs are relentless!,1
"App starts continuously crashing everytime I try to access my drafts, post a new photo, or post a new story post. I get advertisements from IG about post reels and have no option to turn them off.",1
After posting post or reel with song. If song become unavailable then you should add option for changing song also on that particular post or reel. Because some of the song are unavailable after posting. Please do something about it.,1
"I just changed my phone, and nothing else has changed. This simple action caused me to no longer have access to my account. Try using the help center, and all solutions require you to be log-in to the app for it to work. I try contacting support through email to find out the email is no longer working and recommend using the support website.",1
"Cannot send gifs saved on my device, some features are only app specific whereas the web browser form is very lacking which pushes to download the app (I don't want and pushed me even further away). Shifty company and very negatively addictive (avoid or limit if you value your sanity and privacy)",1
I can't save every boomerang video I take because it's always show error 'file not supported' and it's been like this for months. I've tried clearing the cache and reinstalling the app but still the same. Please do something about this. And the notification is sucks too. Especially the DMs notification.,1
"For the past several months I have been getting the site automatically shut down every 10-20 minutes (usually if I'm watching stories). It's become so bad I have just uninstalled the app. I will try reinstalling it to see if it fixes, otherwise site has become unusable.",1
"My first account was hacked!! When I received the email about my email being removed from my account, I proceeded to press the link to ""secure my account"". After doing so, it prompted me to follow the directions on the screen. I got to the point where it wanted me to take a video selfie in order to verify my account. Well, that FAILED 20 TIMES!! I tried contacting instagram, but to no avail. My account is still hacked, and I have scammers running my profile!! A friend took screenshots!!!",1
"The latest update has broken my App! I've had the same post appear when I open the app for 5 days now, then just random reel after reel after reel. If I want to see my usual content, I have to go to a drop down menu then select following, urgh horrible. Don't even bother with it now.",1
"Extremely annoying app. I can't see my comment when I'm typing it, I can't see half of the posts of other profiles and it opens another reel when I open a specific reel. Yet you all add useless stuff with your updates like notes?? Instead why don't you just make updates to fix all these annoying bugs? I rarely put reviews but this is getting out of hand",1
I am unable to see notes feature since a month I have updated my app uninstalled and downloaded it again and again but then also I am unable to see this feature. I have reported Instagram many times but then also I haven't got any help from the side of Instagram. Please resolve my problem as soon as possible. Thank you.,1
"Too many glitches! Facing alot of issues with the app. Also no response even after reporting an issue, please look into it. Not being able to use new features, tried updating the app. But same issue. Reported alot of time but didn't get any update on the tissue. Please resolve it",1
"The app used to be the best. Now it is full of glitches. The app is different in different phones. Features of this app of one phone is different from another phone. The number of glitches is increasing day by day. Eventhough everyone is reporting issues no proper action has been taken till today. Here the users are adjusting according to the app, the app is not changing or adjusting for the users. It's a complete mess. I beg to please fix all the problems and make it a clean and perfect app.",1
"UPDATE: Instagram is now flooding my feed with alt right ads! Good job at making me hate you more. Been on Instagram for years, but it's like their trying to kill this app. Every update is buggy and making it more and more like tick tock. If I wanted to deal with that trash app, I would download that! At this point I might check it once and a while just see what my friends are up to and that's it, this app is that unpleasant to deal with. Such a shame, I use to love using this app for hours.",1
"Because of an account I have not used in at least 2 years, I cant access my main Instagram Account at all. It is assuming I gave away a password to a dead account that I dont even remember the password for. My instagram is how I stay connected to people that are important to me. Even outside the app it pulls up the ""Your Account Has Been Compromised"" bull. I am going to uninstall the app entirely and reinstall, but if that does not work I dont know what I can do.",1
"Lagging, can't receive or send mssgs when it starts to go crazy, dont have the reactions for mssgs nor the possibility to reply to a particular one. I haven't got any update for Instagram since a very long time. If I had to say, it would be like for a year and some months. It's annoying.",1
"It's no longer loading. I've done everything from clearing the cache, deleting the data, restarting the phone, reinstalling the app and checking if it has access to both wifi and mobile data. Yet nothing has fixed this issue.",1
Not sure what it is but Instagram has been acting up. Not posting my stories not sending my messages even when i have good data / wifi. All of my other apps will work but Instagram. I've had to reinstall it a couple of times for my account to work. Only for it to take almost 4 days to update everything to the newer Instagram,1
"Ever since the recent updates... I've been unable to add captions to the reels I've remixed, I don't have the option to view all filters, The colour drop while editing stories stops working, etc, etc.",1
"My highlights stories keep lagging everytime I watch back to check something. It's always error to play I have no clue why so many bugs there then when people sent me message it's mostly after I have seen the message just got received notification, why is the notification is always so late? Please fix this !",1
"In trying to compete with TikTok they ruined this app. It's just reel after reel now, constant video noise. Just feels like this is Facebook trying to be TikTok but shooting their own foot and failing at their goal simultaneously, but still with all the data mining of normal Facebook. Going back to Pinterest I guess",1
"Absolutely shocking app at this moment in time. When trying to upload a post with a number of photos, there will always be at least 1 that is off centre. You go to correct it and then another photo will be off centre. It gets stuck in the loop of a photo always being off centre",1
"The new update has not been good. When I try and upload multiple pictures in a post it crops them all strange. And whenever I try and readjust one picture, then the others move and crop strange. Very frustrating.",1
"In Iran, we have the lowest internet speed in the world. Also, all international sites and applications are filtered. In this limitation, Telegram is well compatible with our internet. But Instagram has the best internet speed in the world from Iranian users. When we want to make a story of a 2 MB video, it takes several hours. And finally, there is no guarantee that it will be uploaded. During these few hours, it is not possible to go from this account to another account.",1
"Not able to access insta from few days. Reels are not loading, the screen is blank. Have cleared the cache, reinstalled thrice, reboot the phone. Nothing worked. Unable to access the help center as well. Need immediate resolution. Some big maybe.",1
"'Notes' Features is not available since 2 weeks. I had also reinstalled the app but no change. My another account also logged in into the same phone, but it have notes features.

"I use Instagram both on smartphone and PC. For the last 3 days I've been facing the same issue. After closing my app on smartphone at night, my direct doesn't refresh in the morning when I open the app, new messages do not show up. So I have to open Insta on my PC firstly. This way my direct refreshes on PC and THEN new messages show up in Instagram app on my smartphone. This is not a solution. I re-installed the app, restarted my smartphone, logged out and in, cleared cache - nothing helped.",1
"I can't open my account because the number that registered on it is very old and not accessible. I already changed the number on my Facebook account, but there were no changes at all. I also tried using my email, but the system still asked for the code for my old number. I tried opening it using my Facebook account, but the system kept saying error. I sent you guys a video of my face to verify; I hope you'll see it immediately because that's the only way to open my account. I really need to open",1
"Can't believe how this app became so popular. Terrible UX, no option to set photos aspect ratios, previews that don't show real crop when horizontal and vertical photos are mixed together, no option to update post after created, ...",1
"All of a sudden, screen goes white and sometimes black which makes letter disappear. 2nd, when i press + symbol to explore upload option. It does not respond. Unfortunately, i have to kill the app and then start to use that. So please take care of this.",1
"Ready to use, but has a Victorian sense of nudity in art. IG it's constantly deleting, then reposting art that is already watered down expressions of publicly shared art. Twitter may be more appropriate for expressive art that includes the nude form. Violent images get a filter option, but not the nude form.",1
"I'm using it from 1 year and it was good first. But now I'm not getting notifications of anything. I don't get notified if someone text me, neither of likes and comments. I hope you guys fixed this. Or maybe help me to fix this. And some filter are also doesn't work perfectly in android. So fix this one too. Otherwise it's good üôÇ",1
"lately i have to refresh my inbox to see new messages or else it only shows old ones, uploading a story mostly consists in all blurry or just black. annoying is also that i can't reply to specific messages or can react with nothing else but a heart. i don't have the privilege of having chat themes or the newest thing of displaying a status. why don't everyone get the same stuff? until it all changes it's only worth a star",1
Ive held off saying anything hoping some of the bugs would work themselves out but its been months. When posting multiple photos on a post. The photos will not keep edits and basically cut off heads and zoom out and give blank spaces.,1
Messages sent by users aren't showing when I open the chat box after a while but then reappear but again disappear in a matter of seconds. It's causing a lot of difficulties chatting with people. Pls fix this asap.,1
"What's with the new 3D avatars?! HORRIBLE! I'm not sure why they decided to go that way and make them 3d, same with Snapchat and FB they look HORRENDOUS! Please for the love of God change them back to the cartoons, they looked so much better. I hope that Snapchat and FB do that too. It doesn't look good! Also would like to go back to the normal order of seeing posts like we used to , in chronological order of posting.",1
"Fix the glitches for Samsung Galaxy S10. I can't edit each photo in a multi-photo post and half appear with a diagonal mirror line that warps the photos completely. Latest update allows each photo to be edited, but crops aren't saved. FIX THE APP!!!",1
"My insta acc started crashing like it had a bug or got hacked, it started logging out by itself and then my followers started disappearing one by one. can't see vedios like before this. the place to dm my friend's friend started not working, it became dark and could not send text. please restore insta as before. thank you",1
"Tried to upload some photos about 6 times and it just doesn't.. Finally get them to upload but if doing multiple pictures at a time it will auto crop 1 or 2 of them, cutting out people's heads. No matter how many times I fix it it still cuts it off",1
"For some reason, my business Instagram account was closed. I have no reason why. It stated that I violated community standards but did not give specifics. I know that is impossible because I literally only posted business related stuff. I tried opening another account and didn't even get a chance to post anything before getting another notification that my account was closed again üôÑ So annoying! All the time, I invested into my page to see it taken down for no reason.",1
"Too many damn notifications. I have multiple accounts for different businesses, but there is no way to shut off notifications for particular accounts, not in the app, not in ""additional settings"" on my phone. Idgaf if someone I may know is on Instagram for every account I have because Instagram is reading the same contacts on my phone for every account. I want all notification permissions on several of my accounts revoked, but that is not possible, and I'm pretty sure that's a spam law violation",1
"App not working in fullscreen mode after recent 2-3 updates. Please fix it. Also, Whenever i click a link, which takes me to a browser after returning back to instagram the app interface does not remain in dark mode and gets whitened out like part black & part white which is super annoying & looks pretty bad, can't see the content properly until you need to force stop it and start it again. Please look into this issue asap.",1
"There is a bug! I made few reels and added locations. Reel does appear at the location but when I click on my reel it sends me to another reel of mine, the first one I've ever made. Instagram can you fix it!?!? I'm not able to show new reels to new viewers because of this bug!! I reinstalled my app and that's not the issue from my side.",1
"It just keeps breaking, first i can't take pictures or videos for my story, now DMs don't work, I've restarted my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled, i just always seem to have problems with Instagram. From a technical standpoint, this app is utterly atrocious. Fix it, Zuckerberg. Update: it's still brokey",1
"There is such a big issue with Instagram screwing up videos that are uploaded. I run a dance account, and we have really great videos that will all of a sudden have random glitches after posting to IG. I will watch the whole video in the preview before it posts and it'll be fine, then when it's posted, it is grainy and awful.",1
"I like using Instagram to keep up with friends, but the personalized ads are far too invasive. Unfortunately there is no option to disable personalization in ads, so I am deleting my account, uninstalling the app, and encouraging friends and family to connect elsewhere.",1
"Lately, my instagram has a bug that it likes the pictures/ posts/ reels, I haven't myself. It's not being fixed and it is so irritating. I've reported it too, but there's ain't no reply yet. Poor experience atm.",1
"The app has been unusable for the last week. I open the app and it freezes and my phone crashes. I can't do anything on my phone and it takes ages to close the app, or even to force restart my phone. This is a newish s22. I've reinstalled the app 4 times and it is still unusable.",1
"i cant add music to my stories. it's been already few weeks now.every time I want to find some song it just says ""no results found"" or it gives me some random song I've never heard of. I reported the problem in the app too. I tried deleting app and then installing again, tried multiple phones but nothing. it only happenes on one of my accounts. idk what to do anymore.",1
"It truly depends on the day if IG is behaving for me or not. In the last month alone I've had to uninstall and re-download the app due to not having the ability to post stories, attach music to reels, edit profile images, etc... Not too sure what's happening, however I'm hoping they'll iron out the kinks between IG and Facebook.",1
"Glitches a lot, cannot load multiple photos from gallery have to be in app and then find all of them spread out, pushes a lot of stupid videos I don't have any interest in, and slow to go to the next page when uoloading then catches up with all taps and goes to auto posting it. Needs lagging updated and spammers removed.",1
"It just a downward spiral, with each update the app gets worse. I can't reply to the messages, quality is terrible during the voice and video calls. And also recently i tried to connect with my wireless headphones but it didn't work i have tried on other apps and its completely fine except on Instagram.",1
"I am automatically following random accounts whom I have never seen. There are 2 possibilities: account got hacked or some 3rd party app is connected to my account. I have changed id , password , applied dual authentication tried every thing, But the problem is not getting solved. Thinking of deleting my account.",1
"1. Sometimes the music added with the post is unavailable, ie; can't hear the music, can only see the post. I updated the instagram, but still the bug exist. 2. Sometimes it's not showing the actual number of followers and following on all the accounts. The count will be little bit less than the actual count.",1
"I still cannot reply to direct messages, apparently this is a bug and it behavios differently across users. I don't have ""update messages"" button either. Followed all the possible tutorials, reinstall the app several times, even use it on another device and I have the same result. Fix this Instagram, you're not a 3rd party app provider, come on...",1
"Internal management issues aside, messages show up with a huge delay (up to 24h). I wish I could use your website instead, but the recent UI changes made it unusable on my device (iPad pro). I like being able to add people to favourites and have a separate feed for them, though.",1
No sound on my Instagram story even though it works on my Facebook story and even when I click on somebody else's story there is sound. Have tried every possible solution and it doesn't work. Didn't change any of the settings on my phone either. Just one of the many problems with this app,1
"Omg! This metaverse is ruining everything! Since college I used to temporarily deactivate my Instagram account whenever I needed a break for sometime, and used to login and reactivate it afterwards without any issue. Now I deactivated it and it is not allowing me to reactivate it, saying this ""username doesn't exist"" and ""wait for sometime before trying again"". Annoying!",1
"Stupidly glitchy, each update makes it worse. Reels are impossible to make, causing crashes, lags, refuses to play, changes timing, and text to speech doesn't work. I get shadowbanned without warning for liking too many posts (but I'm not spam liking, I'm just scrolling and liking posts I genuinely enjoy), and everything I post gets trashed by the image quality. ""Not interested"" fills my explore with similar posts, and the search bar disappears sometimes. It's obvious users aren't listened to.",1
"They keep making it worse. First they increase the ad rate in stories. Then they let the ads consist of multiple parts. Everytime I open the app, I see a new post and then as I'm trying to look at it it refreshes and the post I was trying to interact with vanishes.",1
"this app is the worst, even if you take lots and lots of photos, if you don't check if it's saving, it won't save on its own. worst experience i have ever experienced in social media platforms so far. i had to restart my phone every time i'm going to take pics and save it in my internal storage to work.",1
TRASH. Why can't I rewatch a reel without moving out of instagram app? If I wanted to only see short videos I'd have gone directly to tik tok. If I click watch again I shouldn't have to go into reels by force. Sometimes I just want to watch a clip again and keep scrolling pictures of curvy women. Stop forcing people into reels. Rapidly deteriorating into trash because of trying to copy tik tok. Now its horrible. GARBAGE. I hope Twitter doesn't follow suit. It's painfully boring,1
"Whenever I try to refresh the message place one of my groups dissapears and doesnt reapear before someone else texts in the group. Also I dont see any new messages in the group and I have to refresh, then instantly press on the group and wait like 5-10sec before the new messages load. Its getting really annoying. Also there are so many bots posting random things and nudes and things like that and that is also really annoying. Please fix these problems.",1
"This app was great but as of recently it has become quite problematic. There are instances where my account get logged out, cannot comment on live, comments missing or section not loading, and overall i feel like im missing info. My account has been 'suspended' and i have to log back in but when checking the guideline i have kept within them. My account was hacked and i have been waiting on an reponse for the longest while, so i created a new one and still having problems. NO NEWS FEED",1
"IG was my favorite social media platform for year's, but the last 2 month's changed that! It started when the Google Playstore dropped approx 1/3 of their apps, for older Android phones (of which I've got one) with no warning at all! So I took a ""deep dive"" through the advanced app settings in the Google play store. Then, I updated the ""disabled apps"" & uninstalled my original IG app, then reinstalled it...again. For about an hour, my acct was perfect! Then, it just stopped working again! üòñ",1
"This app is gradually getting worse and worse. I am starting to hate this app. I can't see message button in some accounts. Making me unable to send messages to that account, only follow button is showing. This is very problematic. If the developers still do not solve this problems then I will no longer be interested to use this rubbish app.",1
"App worked fine until mid-October. Then it stopped showing the most recent posts from accounts that I follow. Instead I was seeing posts over a week old. I reinstalled the app only to get no posts at all afterwards. It was just the ""view older posts"" message and suggested posts or accounts. Now, I'm getting a blank page that won't update/reload. I have reported the issues to the Help Center twice with no response or change. I'm just about ready to delete my account.",1
"Buggy to the point you can't use it, algorithm pushing things you don't like in your feed, reels becoming more important than acutal posts and MORE. This is not Instagram anymore it's TikTok!! It's also full of ads and if you want to grow as a artist, photographer, etc. ... you can only dream of it because of the algorithm. If it wasn't for just using it for chatting with people I would have uninstalled it long ago. Also let's not mention the feed now... Instagram is just bad nowadays...",1
New feature of alt text constantly shows up when trying to upload a post. No way to turn this feature off and now with it constantly enabled by instagram hashtag drop down menu no longer shows up while trying to hashtag photos. Basically has made it more complex to try and upload a picture now I will just be using it to scroll through reels no longer useful for uploading pictures. Will probably eventually get rid of it if not fixed,1
Incompetent support Instagram all of a sudden without any warning disabled my account and still hasn't responded how I would be able to get my account back. And there's no way I can get any help from Instagram about how I can retrieve my account as there's no support team to look into this issue.,1
"Really great at showing ads, features you actually want don't function, can't open your photos to edit because it uses all your data and batteries to run or steal data and info off your phone. You are definitely the product and not the customer this app makes you feel that way.",1
I used to love Instagram but now it's become a platform for nudity and bloodshed... the amount of times I see nakedness and people/ animals being hurt or killed is actually disturbing... to the point where I think I just saw a suicide? This app has seriously lost its humility and its sick... I'm gonna download my pictures from the app n remove the app after like 10+years. I suggest others should do the same,1
TF with all the nudity popping up. Done with this app. Not sure what caused this but fix it asap. Doesn't matter how many times I report pages it still shows up. Someone messed up the way this platform works.,1
"Inconsistent Story Uploading I recorded a great cooking video for my story, went to add a stamp/icon onto it and it froze my video. I tried to save it, didn't work..tried to upload it, got an error message. Was then prompted to check my Recent History section but of course it wasn't saved This app really is trash.",1
I am using Instagram from a very long time but after the recent updates I'm getting through a lot of glitches like it sometimes doesn't let me post stories and when I upload stories it drops the pixels and whenever I enter into a chat the send button dissappears and I have to enter chat again to send the message also my posted stories are not showing up in the archive folder if I want them to be added in my insta highlights I can't find them anywhere what the glistch @instagram plzz fix this.,1
"Buggy app that randomly refreshes after viewing any post, crashes, will not upload in a timely manner, and then will randomly shut down business accounts. Poor quality product. In a world of Tick Tok, Hive, and even Tumblr, Insta is rapidly becoming not worth it.",1
"Hi, Same issue again within a month It's been more than 4 days since my account has not been working. I am unable to send or receive any messages neither did able to play any reel or story. Even i m not able to report the problem in my settings. Kindly fix my account issue ASAP.",1
"This new notes feature is absolute garbage and it is annoying to see it. I can't sit and mute everyone. It needs to be removed, placed elsewhere where it's not in the way if you're so desperate to have it or something else. If I had known, I'd have NEVER updated the app.",1
"There is a glitch I am experiencing for quite a while. Whenever I click on a website and come back to the app , the whole screen colour inverts itself. Then again I have to restart the app. And just for clarification it's not happening because of any other 3rd party app or settings of the phone. Improve the app instead of firing employees",1
This application has become so unusable. At times I'll click on a profile and it won't load I have to close and reopen the application a number of times before profiles load. Pretty much becoming a bad application.,1
"Discussed that Instagram isn't concerned about users security. I have my account stolen and wrote to Instagram several times and was completely ignored. Very annoying and not professional. Only use it not to sync with our bands website, but never look at anything else.",1
Crashes constantly. Fustrating since I've recently found shops in Instagram that carry unique items usual for my family. Almost unusable. I've contacted several shops inquiring as to other ways to purchase their items. Very disappointing since i could most likely take and post selfies all day long with no problems.,1
"What is wrong with this app! I'm not receiving notifications anymore, my story is still splitting <60 sec videos, and many other issues. I've tried reinstalling and everything.",1
"It appears that as of your previous update, we no longer have the ability to save the audio used in reels by others. This capability allowed others to save a song to use at another time for their own videos and reels. Please reinstall this useful ability as soon as possible.",1
"I have few complaints regarding the user experience, i cannot use some features (they are available to my friends who live in same region as me). Features like replying to specific messages, reacting with emotes other than red heart, messenger icon etc i dont have them at all. Please fix it and id gladly change it to 5 stars since this is a good app otherwise.",1
Don't know why they're not fixing so many bugs. I'm facing problems while uploading stories. Everyone can upload story of duration 1 minute except me. I am only able to upload the story of duration just 15 seconds either it is reel or from gallery. They should fix basic bugs instead of adding so many useless features which is only creating mess and nothing else.,1
"The new instagram is horrible. The thing I have the most problem with is about is being unable to see how long ago a person reads your message. All you know is they have seen your message. Also, you can't reply to one specific message like before, and there is no reply function. I can deal with the constant changes that make the interface uglier and uglier, I can deal with the prioritization of reels, but now I can't even talk to my friends properly. What am I supposed to use this app for now?",1
Reels have been broken for months. They cause instagram to white out everything and can't read text. Sometimes a reel will not load and still have the audio of the previous reel playing. Same 5 reels will play over and over for about a week if you swipe.,1
"I dont understand why Instagram is getting worse and worse instead of better and better. I have still issues with Music in Hungary (should be already a international function), I can't draw anymore with the brushes when I want to share a picture of gallery or share a post, I can't turn the screen when someone uploaded a 16:9 video and many more...how about listening to the reviews instead of doing your own thing?",1
"Your app is frustrating my life. My experience since I relocated has been terrible. I'm losing my mind trying to contact you guys for the past 1 week without any response. Now they are saying my user ID is invalid. What is going on. You just just suddenly deleted a reel I had with over 700,000 likes and making it impossible to get help. I will actually actively seek another option and completely delete my gram. I may be one user but I'll definitely not be a part of an app that doesn't care.",1
"I don't know whats happening nowadays to Instagram. Since many days, there are many weird updates in Instagram. There are really many bugs now. I can't see stories and posts of anyone even if my network is excellent, every app will work but still Instagram doesn't work properly. Especially stories and posts. All becomes black everytime i open Instagram. instead of adding these irritating updates, i request you to add any useful update or just make it like it was before. THANK YOUH!",1
This is the worst experience ever. I've been using Instagram from past 9 years and now my account is hacked and I'm not able to block the account completely. The hackers have changed all my personal information because of which I'm not able to do anything to block it or recover it. And I'm not able to contact instagram help desk. Please help me in either recovering the account or blocking it please.,1
"Crashes quite often no matter what I'm doing. I most often notice it while either scrolling through my feed or texting in my DMs. I've already tried deleting and reinstalling, and clearing the cash. Meta pls give us the ability to go an update or 2 back.",1
"With new update it's still acting weird, the app isn't working properly. It's like it isn't receiving data or something. Upon refreshing the page, it says couldn't refresh your feed. Please fix this.",1
"Instagram is better than fb but it's buggy. It's bloated and congested with things you don't need! Both Platforms clearly dont understand how people watch videos, as they make it impossible to scroll back, so you have to watch it all the way through and then again if you miss something. I blame the influencers for this media outcome that's lead these companies into disturbing so much of our peace and ability to connect with our loved ones like we use to.",1
"Constant issues with uploading, app crashes when trying to post stories. Video quality is lesser. Like come on guys, support Android the way you support Apple. This is ridiculous. Now 6/29 I can't post stories or anything. Haven't been able to for over 48 hours and this is how I do business. Endlessly frustrated with this unstable app. Now reels only upload upside down. I've deleted and reinstalled the app, it's been doing this for days. Lol please fix",1
There is definitely some problem. I am not able to see the post that I have posted on my account and also not able to follow anyone. Not even able to see the stories of others. Also not able to change the password of my account. My acc is logining out again and again automatically. And when I try to login my acc insta don't open. I am not able to login my acc. I changed my password so many time. But still it is showing wrong password. You need to fix it as soon as possible.,1
Instagram has lost its charm and only has bugs and glitches left. Originality lost to Snapchat and Tik Tok while backend is pathetic. Audio chosen for reels automatically changes to different song on preview or white noise on upload. Can't even approach anyone to resolve the issue!! Horrible for new content creators!!!,1
"The app itself is amazing, but I had to verify some things for my account, so I tried to do that. The email verification worked, but the phone number verification doesn't work and now I'm stuck on the verification code and I'm not getting my verification code via sms. I literally cannot get back to my main page... One star because of the verification problems",1
"I had a better experience once upon a time. But recent times, my account was got hacked by someone & even my colleagues. Though we have a privacy towards to open. Fortunately it happened, very worst. After getting Hacked of my account, immediately I tried all the possible methods to get back my account. It was not actually happened. Many technical issues occuring while scrolling posts.",1
The new update of Instagram is full of bugs. Previously we could reply to a particular message after selecting that also could use emoji to react to it. But now all those have disappeared and the app usage itself becoming troublesome. Want those previous features back.,1
"My app is in latest version but I'm not getting the instagram notes feature, i had that feature but it got removed from my account and guess what the notes feature is working well on my other accounts which i use less, how come? And this often happens when update comes it only show features on my other accounts not on my main account or on every account, y'all really need to fix this. Thanks",1
"Shameful! The app glitches alot. I have a better internet connection and high end device, but still the reels or any particular video lags like it's 1000gb sized video. Please fix this issue. I've been experiencing it from almost a month and thought you might fix it but it's still there.",1
"Good to see friends n family but on top of ads and suggestions I see more posts from people I don't follow. Find myself using less and less. Maybe FB should take a break from algorithms and let people choose to see what they want instead of trying to guess and force us to look at things. If I look up something no need to see ads on every platform, I'm already interested, I looked it up!",1
"Can not even browse the home page. Got a fine working internet connection but still can't use Instagram app. So many glitches, bugs even after so many updates is something that a big company like this shouldn't face a problem with.",1
"Useless, everytime I try post anything it just loops back to the beginning of the process then freezes, sends info back to developer then shuts down and my phone slates it to sleep. I recommend fixing of you want people to be able to use the platform .....",1
Ads are way too frequent. I block all sponsored and advertised accounts but hate that I have to click onto the account to do so as I'm sure it registers as engagement. I also wish the timeline setting saved to default to older posts on followed accounts not suggested ones. It is also unsettling that I am getting targeted ads for something I might have searched or spoken about outside of the app. 12/7/22 update to say I noticed the ad frequency went to every 4 posts (prev 5) I hate it here :),1
"Would have given it 5 stars but why doest this app always has so many bugs like from 2 days it's not showing any reels and when it does,they are all ads, I even restarted my tab but still nothing improved when ever I try to refresh the page it just show ""we're sorry, but something went wrong. Please try again"" and when it finally reloads my whole for you page refreshes and shows me random reel I never watch.",1
Instagram used to be my fav social media. But recently it is encountering too many bugs and the new update isn't good as well. 1. Sometimes story doesn't open at all. 2. A few times i tried posting story it kept showing posting but didn't post. Had to uninstall and install it back. 3. I don't want to see suggested posts on my main Insta feed. I have explore option for that. 4. The reels took over explore button. Now I have to go to main page and click on explore which makes it more tiring.,1
There are a lot of issues going on with insta serach . I can't find older pages via seach bar. there should be searh filters to show pages in chronological order from older to newer or vice versa. Instagram should add a future of search by image also so that it is either to locate the source of a content and give credit.,1
"One thing that I notice as Professional Photographer is a Quality issue when you use Android it doesn't match with OS users. The quality drops you need to fix this, this is bad it's better to keep the quality high.l, Thanks.",1
"it used to be fine, but lately i've seen more ads and ""recommended content"" then the people i actually follow. i also have a ""message your friends"" notice everytime i open my DM's, which doesn't notify me of new messages. oh and the ""this person is on Instagram..."" spam even though i turned off that notification, is just horrid. you won't do anything about it, so i'm just doing thumb exercises.",1
"I'm a content creator everyday I have to post or put something in the story to keep my ratings up , I experienced so many bugs in this app and sometimes I felt , don't want to report it , but now you're app is not loading , it is showing me unexpected error occurred , I tried to report about it through the instagram support , please fix this problem",1
"Full of bugs! The app doesn't post photos in the way I edited them. I spent time editing photos, pressed save (!), the app showed me the preview with my corrections, but after posting, I see the default photos with artefacts! It appears on both my phones!",1
"I don't know if the number of bugs have increased after the Fb acquisition or was it before that. But the point still stands that so many app breaking bugs still exist which no one is talking about or are being taken care of. 1. The ""Add to collection"" option in android has been missing for more than a year and yet it's not fixed. 2. When we open our comment from notification menu (4th tab in android), we are not able to see the other comments in that particular thread.",1
"Selectively picking users for new features. Not sure what Instagram is doing, but my feature for replying in DMs is unavailable. Doesn't make sense because friends in the same area have the feature. There's no ""update messaging"" option as everyone keeps saying. Re-installed latest version today. No VPN usage. This is terribly unfair and honestly bounds for discrimination. Why are some people unable to get the feature????? I've tried for DAYS. No kidding.",1
"Horrible experience with the entire system. My Accounts keep getting locked out, removed, etc. My account that's up with the email now suddenly doesn't exist. I make a new one and they want my phone number, my email, codes etc. and then A PICTURE OF ME WITH A CODE AND NAME WRITTEN ON A PAPER. I immediately deleted the app and swear to never use it again. Gotta love the META invading privacy. Wish I could give a fat 0.",1
"Thank you for considering my feedback for instagram.overall,I really enjoy using the app and have found it to be a great platform for connecting with friend and discovering new content. One of the things I appreciate most about instagram is the variety of features it offers, such as the ability to share photos and videos, and filters and effects, and engage with others through likes, comment, and direct message. I also appreciate, But some problem instagram better experience in full screen",1
The app is good but one thing should be added that if a person is sending me a reel please add that to how much persons he/she sended the reel. I want this feature because if my friend is sending me a reel that you are my best friend and he/she is sending the same reel to all persons in his DM list so how could I know that he is lying and he/she is my fake friend. Please Instagram add the feature. Thanks for reading Instagram I hope you will not ignore it,1
"If I wanted to watch nothing but tiktok, I would download tiktok. The algorithm is trash. Before Facebook bought Instagram, my explore page was beautiful and full of content I wanted to see. Now, all I get are tiktoks that have nothing to do with any content I engage in and frankly annoy the hell out of me. No matter how much I purposefully try to engage with and save content I actually enjoy, it never ever recommends anything to me that I actually want to see. On the verge of deleting.",1
I'm not able to use reaction feature in dms and also can't reply to a specific message i tried updating it many times tried reinstalling but nothing worked please fix this issue as soon as possible. I'm so done with this thing now. How many times do I have to update/reinstalle to get those features?! Please fix this ASAP!,1
"Using the app for years. Don't like how it's trying to be TicTok (which makes it even more toxic)... But after removing several people I no longer talk to, the app claimed I ""gave my password away to get more likes""... I haven't been able to log in for over a week to message people.. and not a single attempt to correct the issue, or even acknowledge this and contact me... Toxic app. Toxic company",1
"Super glitchy. Cannot even pay for ads for advertising. Not sure if Instagram is still worth the investment of time or not, as simple things like this cannot done. I had carried out ads in previous years and all worked well. This time it restricted my acc from running ads, and I can't even submit a review to inform there's an error. - AFTER 4DAYS STILL UN RESOLVE. WHAT ON EARTH IS HAPPENING? ITS JUST A SMALL MATTER TO FIX THE ADS BUTTON?!",1
"After using this app for 7 years, I can no longer post properly as of 2 days ago. I changed nothing on my phone, have cleared cache in the Instagram app, cleared temp junk files from my phone, deleted all data from the IG app, uninstalled IG, reinstalled it and it's still having the same problem. And this issue is happening on 2 different phones. If I try to upload multiple pics, I can only edit the first one. So strange. I'll be deleting Instagram from my 2 phones and tablet",1
"The app keeps asking me for sms verification and won't let me open any menus meanwhile I don't even recieve the sms. I tried multple times, tried with multiple devices, internet connection, phone number and nothing works. The app is failing and they wont even help me fix this. The support center is useless and there is no way to contact them since all their emails are just bots and there are no contact center or anything to reach them.",1
"One fine day all of a sudden my Instagram application is not working, I have uninstalled and reinstalled it almost like 15-20 times, but really not understanding now where to get it started. Check this problem guys.",1
"The past several versions have given me washed-out photos that are way brighter than the preview showed, unless I pick an image manipulation filter like stretch first. And now that filter doesn't work with my camera. The camera itself works fine and behaves as expected in every other app.",1
"Latest update a mess, too many unnecessary page suggestions which is extremely annoying and not seeing posts from people I actually follow or jumps back to older posts. I also have to log into my account every time, again, extremely annoying. Please fix these issues. I really don't like all the page suggestions popping up constantly.",1
"Full of bugs in new update. I'm not able to upload stories, I can't see DM and reels are not opening. There is a continuous buffering. I have uninstalled and reinstalled at least 15 - 20 times and still facing same issue from past 10 days. Sometimes it's not working at all. I couldn't search any account.",1
"Worst app ever saw. It suddenly gets crashed stops working it takes hours to send a message if I send a message to someone it could takes an hour to get delivered even I've a good internet connection. Useless app, Instagram developers should do more works on this app cause the app doesn't run smoothly as it was earlier running.",1
"in the last few months instagram has crapped its pants making uploading photos an absolute nightmare. Making any minor edits/adjustments is impossible, uploading multiple photos triggers a bunch of glitches / 50% of the time this causes an error that stops the photos from uploading and crashes the app. literally no point trying to upload content via instagram , working around all the glitches takes way too long and is a mega frustrating experience.",1
"Had to update this, if I could give 0 or less stars I would. The explore feed defaults to generic garbage architecture and scenery instead of what you are actually interested in but the 'not interested' option doesn't stop any of it. The page struggles to refresh/update but it makes damn sure you get a 2x2 ad shoved in your face as if all the other cancer ads for blatant scams aren't enough.",1
"Disappointed, worst updated version. I can't post long videos in IGTV, just showing reels. I was teaching my students with IGTV series section. Now I just downloading this app everyday when I upload videos and then it changes into reels again and I had to uninstall the app everyday and download again again. And also so much Bugs in DM section. It is no longer as my favorite app, sadly.",1
"The chat experience on Android (Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G, up to date) is basically unusable at the moment. Constantly failing to load messages, notifications aren't working as normal, requests have an ongoing notification dot which doesn't exist in both the hidden requests or all requests tabs. The inclusion of a ""Channels"" chat tab has cluttered the menu and moved my general tab over to the far right-hand side, beyond the requests tab, which is bizarre, considering I hardly check requests.",1
Everytime Instagram update. It is filled with glitches and bugs. Right now every time i double tap on video the video is going mute/while it has to like the video. Ifyou give us a update please stable the version before rollout....,1
"Last update on s21 will not allow more than one photo in a post to be edited (filter). When selecting other photos, it just goes back to the first one. It also off-centers photos and places black bars on the sides of photos. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. Same issue on all Galaxy phones.",1
"Some of stories have disappeared from stories achieve even though I have posted on stories and then after 24 hours when I checked back my stories achieve, I couldn't find them anywhere from it and I assumed they had disappeared after 24 hours. However, when I checked stories like/love icon notifications, it also has this issue. Instagram, please fix it quickly, I can't lose those stories that I wanted... Thank you.",1
"Reel effects filters are not working . The one that use to work before are not working either. Update: havent been able to see peoples feed after clicking on their profile. It has got so buggy its almost useless right now. It shows ""couldnt refresh feed"" Edit : with every update its getting worse. Many features are not working for me",1
Constant glitches. Problems with uploading videos and publishing captions with posts even after updating the app. Please fix. Nothing but pissed off now. I have a few different insta accounts and have the same issues on each.,1
"Can't even tell whether the app is working anymore , half the time the top set of buttons (Instagram, Notifications, Upload ,DM button) won't display and now my notifications won't appear when I receive either likes , comments or other important notification even though my notifications ARE turned on. Posts are also glitched when I upload them , they are posted in funny and bizzare angles , sometimes distorted , making me have to re-upload the photo again. Please fix these issues.",1
"I wish I could give zero stars. Worst app ever since Facebook took over. Feed doesn't load, reels are terrible, glitches, kicks you out constantly. It's nothing but bots and ads. Go back to photo feeds. That's what it was designed for, that's why everyone used it, that's why Facebook acquired it. The engagement has tanked, I never see my following feed; it's maybe ten accounts the rest is ads or random. Going into discover always, always kicks you out saying Instagram encountered an error.",1
"Stuttering when uploading instastories with samsung s22 series. When uploading a video with 1080P 60fps, video become lagging, so the video had frame rate drop and choppy not smooth, it's like lower than 30fps. Please fix it, fix the compatibility, fix quality",1
New subscription feature won't allow users to unsubscribe. I've reported to instagram many times in the past two weeks that I am getting an error message when trying to unsubscribe. So now I'm gonna be stuck paying $5/mo endlessly?! I want to unsubscribe. Fix your app and bugs before releasing new paid features.,1
"I try to post things, Instagram just sucks. Literally have to re-download the app every 2 weeks because of some stupid unfixed dev error that causes the app to crash as I'm putting the finishing touches on my Reels. Worthless social media trash is what this app is. Can't even handle rendering a 20 second 4k clip. Absolute garbage, 0/5 stars honestly.",1
1. I've been updating this app as much as I can but the issues don't go away for an example when I want to post something and there's like 3 photos attached I go crop one picture and as soon as I leave that one picture to edit another the cropping won't stay it just goes back to normal which is really annoying and wastes my time! 2. The followers and following lists are mixed up and not working I can't see my latest and earliest or the hashtags I follow.,1
"Drafts never save, editing often doesn't show the effect changes during the process (only once confirming for upload), and many features, mostly the Adjust option is entirely broken and doesn't save your changes at all. These issues ongoing for months. Phone: Samsung S9, ample RAM and Storage, latest OS and app version.",1
"Terrible app! Each new update comes with lots of bugs without fixing the privious one... What the Insta team is doing? I'm not able to see DM when someone text me I recieve a notification from Instagram but when I open the DM there's no message, to see the message I need to reinstall Instagram. Whenever I use the quiz option in story and after saving it in draft, if I want to change something in the Quiz sticker the app gets crashed. Please fix them ASAP.",1
"I've had trouble with updating and scrolling down my home page, so i reinstalled the app. The problem's fixed but now i can't reply to specific messages in chats or choose a reaction to them (it automatically puts the ""‚ù§Ô∏è""), i can't access the vanish mode either. Why keep adding new features if u can't properly manage the original and the actually vital ones???",1
Did you guys REALLY have to make it so much harder to save reel audio? Every time people get used to something you guys change it to be even dumber. What was even the point? I would like to save audios without needing to use the stupid search and be able to save original audios. Who in the world thought this was a good decision in the slightest?,1
"For the past few weeks I can't see the actual state of my DMs. In one dialogue I'd see only some of the messages/reactions from the other person, but not all of them (if I compare it to the browser version). Honestly, this simply put me off of using Instagram altogether. UPD: plus now I don't see captions of posts I open from the explore page. I'm lowkey curious how you're gonna fail next.",1
"After years of posting innocuous photos of my family, Instagram unceremoniously deleted my account without warning and without explanation. I know nothing posted was against the guidelines, but there's no way to contact them for a review. I guess all of my previous photos and posts are gone. What a waste of time.",1
Making Reels is Impossible since I switched to my Pixel 7 Pro. The whole thing glitches and half of the design options don't work. Instagram clearly favors Apple and it's extremely noticeable when I made the switch from Apple to Android.,1
"I regularly lose features on this app with no reason or warning. I enjoy posting little drawings on my stories but it seems that the draw function simply does not exist for me anymore. It's been replaced with a filter button that barely works half the time. Reels will constantly slow my phone down to an insane degree, chats will disappear, and story posts will often not post. This app is actively hostile to its users.",1
"I can't do anything on this app that I need to do to run my business. I don't get all of the same app features or options that others have, such as I cannot import audio for reels, which is extremely inconvenient. If it were possible to phase out instagram from our marketing I would, because at this point without my business partner having an iPhone I would just be screwed when it came to producing the content we need. But this creates a huge problem for sharing tasks. I'm so disappointed.",1
"The ""type in the words used in a post"" option when clicking not interested is still absolutely useless! Go back to using ""this topic doesn't interest me"" in the not interested because at least that actually freaking worked. Like why are you getting rid of the features that actually worked and replacing them with stuff that don't work at all?",1
"don't know what other way to get big companies' attention besides 1 star review. there ahould be an option where posts can be public but followers still need to be approved. there are lots of spam and junk accounts i don't want following me but my posts should be public. Edit: when you want to watch a full video, the preview shows the full thing but the edges get cropped when you want to see the full video and it goes full screen vertically Edit: the app has bugs. A bunch of em after reinstall",1
"The app is so laggy when playing reels and stories, the performance must improved, and you guys should add the reply functionality in messages section, because what we currently have is not a good user experience. I hope Meta team imporove Instagram and add more features to it and to the chat system",1
"In the last 6 mos or so the app off and on crashes, it will just kick me off. I enjoy instagram but I've had to delete the app at least twice and restart my phone a number of times. I wish there was consistency in me being able to use it. And I can't see to find a way to force update or anything like that.",1
"It just won't let me post without glitching out anymore. I try to upload an image and it stays trying to load the filters forever (I don't even use the filters, I shouldn't have to go through this useless step and be locked there if I'm going to skip it anyway). Edit: And it's getting worse, I guess. Now it crashes on me every 10-15 minutes with no explanation and the stories I've already seen keep appearing as ""new"" endlessly. Annoying.",1
"I'm not enjoying this. All content is video now, and not even original content - it's just reposts from tiktok, reddit, twitter etc. Who even enjoys using Instagram anymore? I'd delete it but I follow a few artists who are fantastic but even then, a lot of them have had to use videos in an attempt to not be locked out by the algorithm. The suggested content is dreadful, the targeted ads are terrible. If you haven't started using Instagram yet, I'd suggest to stay far away.",1
"Whenever I try and post a story with music, it wont let me choose popular music such as katy perry songs, country songs from Thomas Rhett or any of the known songs in the world. It does not even allow me to browse for songs, whenever I type in a song name or song artits it says ""no results"". I have uninstalled and reinstalled. I have updated, I have restarted my phone, nothing works. But all of my friends can post music to their stories except me. Highly irritated.",1
"Horrendous! Lately it's literally IMPOSSIBLE to use this app! I can't upload videos in stories, only if I select them from the gallery. Oftentimes i can't update the feed, the app just crashes....and highlights, can't add anything there HORRIBLE!!!!",1
"So many glitches. Literally the app isn't working at all even my internet works perfectly the app doesn't responds at all. Dm's aren't opening also can't able to play any reel. Nothing's working at all. I've updated it many times uninstalled and reinstalled still no update. Many many bugs and glitches. Tired of loading dm's, I'm not at all able to open any of my dm. Do fix these problems ASAP. I've reported for many times still there ain't any response. It's annoying to use app with many bugs in",1
"The shittiest of all problems, and a nonsensical one too for that matter. Everytime I click a picture with the app camera and try uploading as story, or want to upload a picture from my phone Gallery, or Google photos to my story or edit a pic on Instagram camera section and want to download it- the whole thing is BLACK. TOTAL BLACK!! No matter how many times I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app, no matter how many times I've cleared app and cache data - IT JUST WON'T STOP HAPPENING üò°üò°üò°",1
"My instagram count on videos aren't being counted. I've tested from other accounts outside of my linked ones, and it's really unfair. Please fix. Thanks! Also my videos are Not being shown in tag feeds, and I use the 30 tags, and no video of mine is over limit.. I've tested this from other none Linked accounts as well please fix. Thanks. I'll update my rate when fixed. Thanks. (Account:Dreamgurlnena",1
"It will not save the positioning of my photos. I set my photo to my desired positioning but when I tap save, the photo shifts to both the right and up, creating a large white space on the left and cropping my photo. I try to correct it on the editing page, but it will not save my positioning edits. And when I save the cropping of one photo, it undoes the cropping of another. It's been like this for a month. Looking at reviews, I see I'm not the only one with this issue. When will you fix this?!",1
"Everything is good, only one thing I couldn't understand, why everytime when I uploaded my reels, Instagram automatically decrease my video quality. I m so tired of it. And also text option and it's timer did not work properly once after the video is uploaded.",1
"Nower days Facing lots of bugs, very horrible experience. My account is not even loading in the app. Can't send any message, can't open any reels, message is not loading, not able to refreshing. I'm a creator so, I'm facing lots deficiency in operating the app. I uninstalled and installed many number of time and my network is very good even though it not responding. I Requesting you to look into it and rectify it soon.",1
"Auto crops my photos, won't let me zoom in or adjust at all. The minute I post, it messes up my photos and crops off heads. Super annoying. Been going on for weeks to the point I don't even want to use the app.",1
WHY SO MANY BUGS? Horrendously buggy and if it doesn't crash mid use the photos upload incorrectly (overly zoomed ect) and not in anyway that I have selected on the app making it very difficult and not user friendly at all as I have to use a separate app to have the correct size just to make the app useable.,1
"I am facing a lot of bugs and it's very irritating 1. In inbox messages I am not able to react to any messages except the heart one 2. In inbox messages I am not able to reply to a particular message. Both of these above features are live for other users from a long time but still I am not able to use them, please fix this glitch ASAP",1
"12/22 For about a month now, my feed hasn't been able to reliable load anything but Stories. If I want to refresh my feed, view comments, look at a profile, or watch a reel, I have to keep pushing it to reload dozens of times until somehow eventually it will finally load in. The app just can't even support itself anymore. 8/22 Instagram doesn't even recommend to me static images anymore. It is now just a cheap TikTok ripoff.",1
"So sick of the ""photo can't be posted"" issue. Can you PLEASE tell me why so I can fix whatever it is? Also the app has been extremely laggy for the past month or so, even with updates. No lags on any of my other apps EDIT: it's been months and the app is still extremely laggy. Can you actually optimize your app instead of figuring out more sneaky ways to gather user data? Turn off microphone permissions when not in use!!",1
"Thank you so much for the preponderance of ads! I've stopped noticing the posts from my actual subscriptions. It's so frustrating that I stopped going to Instagram! Yay, the end of procrastination! Bravo! Now I don't stay in any account longer than I need to in order to respond to posts. Great! Do the same with Facebook and we'll finally get rid of people's addiction to social media!",1
Account was hacked. Instagram needs a team active to deal with these problems immediately. The hacker changed my email and number. When I got the emails from Instagram I tried clicking the links they provide if you did not make the changes. None of the links work and I kept ending back up at the faq. I'm waiting on an email back hoping they actually check it.,1
"I have been using insta for many years and no doubt it is my favorite but since few months it has faced many problems like filter does not come on story option, I also updated it.I am not able to save my photo, I have also updated by applying filter on story but no use, this is very bad experience of my insta.please fix this problem quickly insta.",1
"Each update seems to break some basic functionality related to image editing, whether it's zooming, stretching, filter, or just basic image selection. There's no rhyme or reason for what Meta is trying to improve with this app.",1
Every new feature added means another feature left ignored and more bugs. Video quality uploaded from Android is poor and inconsistent. Editing features on reels is limited and the reach is just as limited as it would be on posts unless you're posting every single day. This is such a high demand application with such little reward. Paid advertising feature doesn't pull in what is promised. All they want is money and the functional aspects of the app are completely ignored. No wonder it's dying.,1
"This is the only social media app I really use. It was all good until these annoying suggested accounts for you kept popping up on my feed. I followed the instructions to opt-out, even deleted data and and un-install the app. It infuriates me to see people I don't like suggested to me! That's the only reason I'm giving 1 star, if I could give none I would. Please enable an option to not see suggestions at all!",1
From past few days the app is not at all working good..when we open the app it's completely blank and new feeds are not loading not able to uplode anything...in the beginning i thought it's my wifi issue and raised an complent but the actual problem is with the app...i hope u guys will resolve the issue or i will delete my Instagram account and uninstall the application...very shamefull having this kind of technology and not able rectify the issue.,1
"Group chats aren't loading full messages unless I log out and log back in. Turned into Tik-Tok and shadow banning. Why did the devs take away the feature to scroll through videos? Videos are automatically paused and audio is off without a visible audio button. The bots in comments and DMs are insane. Definitely taking steps backward with each ""update"". Still no fix for group chats not loading for days.",1
"It's garbage. If tiktok wasn't Chinese Spyware you should just use that. Honestly fb video is better. Who's the 70 IQ window licker who decided to make a photo sharing platform that only promotes video, and then makes the worst video player ever. What other app doesn't have the ability to restart a video or rewind? You gotta sit there for the whole damn thing and hope to God you get it the next time. Horrible app literally every single competitor is better",1
"For some reason,I haven't been able to reply direct messages. I got a new phone recently and downloaded Instagram,I've tried updating the app but still nothing. I can't change themes or reply direct messages,which is starting to really annoy me.",1
"I use Instagram for over 4 years now and never had an issue with it but recently the app keeps glitching not showing me all the messages I get from friends till I refresh it like 50 times, the messages sometimes don't send and so much more. The first time that this app disappointed me was the messenger update, It's not available in my country WHY? And the notes? Didn't get that update either. Horrible, I won't use Instagram again until it's at least functional.",1
It keeps give me the messages status fail thing and I've lost two accounts already. It's getting frustrating because it's the third time it's happened this week. I've looked up videos and it worked for awhile but not anymore. I don't know what to do,1
"Besides the apparent transphobia & fatphobia, the app itself is less than stellar. It crashes when trying to upload a reel, crashes when mindlessly scrolling through feed, & never stays consistent with showing anything new; just the same recycled videos from the same recycled users.",1
"Cant snooze suggested posts for 30 days anymore? It's all ads, suggested posts and suggested reels now. Very frustrating to scroll my feed. Makes the app super unappealing to use. Also trying to make everyone use reels is so painful to watch... so many ppl are so bad at it. Just let them go back to posting images with words.",1
"Used to be brilliant and reliable. More recently I get a minute or two of seeing it as it should be and then I loose pictures, posts and can't view stories. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but this has no improvement. It's a shame.",1
"Earlier it was really an amazing app but with latest few updates it is becoming even worse. Either few of the features not available or if available then disabled with new updates or after log out and log in again some of the features disabled. Some features like downloading story with sound and notes got disabled in my account and today one more scam got happened that is, no one can mention me in their stories. Now why the hell I'll use the app, it became disgusting as f***.",1
"I am a content creator and the reels are very unreliable! For example, i just made a reel and the words were black with a white background, and when I published it the white background was gone. So frustrating!",1
"With a new update instagram lost identity and became a bad copy of tiktok. Don't bother installing it, there is original tiktok out there. Instagram reduced dramatically social contacts, very few of your followers can see your new posts. It is slow like offline. Something wrong happens with instagram.",1
"I deactivated my account a week ago, and now i have reactivated and for some reason the app is not working. I am able to log in but unable to use anything, reels are not loading, messages or my profile or anything else is not working, it keeps showing loading and nothing loads. I have tried uninstalling, changing network, it is working fine in the browser but not in the app",1
"I'm a regular user but being a tester I could say, these days Instagram is full of bugs. Messages sent by someone today will appear after 3-4 days. Sometimes, reels are not posted and you will loose your video too, it's not saved in the draft, sometimes reels icon goes missing when you are at home page,when you make a reel on Instagram and save it in your drafts to post later, the song will be lost when you login again.And many more bugs.Please hire good testers or you will loose many users.",1
"Useless things pop-up in the feed which has nothing in common to the things I have been seeing!! The language option in the app is useless, everything is still in English by default even after changing it to French or Spanish. False positive notification indicators making the app more miserable than it already is. Website is more thrash.. new unread messages/ notification labeled but nothing actually visible. Activity notification from past 2-3 months coming up now all of them repetitive.",1
I unfollowed two people and got flagged by the system. Ever since then my account was disabled and pending review. It's been days and everytime it makes me reset my password but I've forgotten it at this point. I can't even request for a password reset because the page keeps kicking me out. I don't even get a second to put in my email or phone number in before it crashes. The help centre doesn't even say anything about app glitches in the password reset page.,1
"To those who wants to try to link their profile to other profile just to see what will happen, just don't do it because it is hard to unlink the profile and sometimes it doesn't work. I tried many times last year and I tried now yet there's no changes. Instagram you should do something about this. At least make a option where you can easily unlink or link it, to make the procedure more faster than a complicated one that doesn't even work.",1
"I do not know why it is so difficult to post pics on Instagram. Iam unable to post it the way I want..the photos get weirdly cropped even after multiple attempts at fixing it and editing pics is a big headache. I really dont understand why they are making it so user unfriendly. In contrast to this, posting pics on Facebook is much easier. Posting pics on Instagram has become a mood killer!! Kindly fix this if anyone concerned is actually reading these reviews!!!",1
"I'm annoyed that the feature to remove suggested posts from main feed has vanished, my feed is filled with these now whereas before they would just be on my explore page. It makes the use of the app a chore and while I can choose to view older posts on a separate page, that is an inconvenience. The algorithm can't even recognise when it suggests the exact same post that has been edited slightly differently so my feed is crammed with chaff. The same reason I stopped using facebook.",1
"Its been 3 days and the app is still not working and is having some issues. I have good internet connection but my feed is not working fine. All the videos, posts and stories are plain white or black. If the app is down, when is it going to be fixed? I loved using this app as it gives me more privacy to choose the people i want to get access to me. I hope it get fixed asap.",1
"Aside from the obvious damaging effects on happiness and productivity, this app recently stopped working for no reason. I've tried logging out and back in, deleting and redownloading the app, but it has only made the app completely stop working. All it says is ""couldn't refresh feed"". Update: this has now happened twice. Garbage app",1
"Actually somehow got worse since I posted my original review. Add to the awful changes to the feed, focus on copycat reels with no originality and tanking engagement, the app is now so buggy as to be barely unusable most days. Pretty damn awful these days. Sponsored and suggested posts all over the place. A move away from photos to video that no-one asked for. Chasing TikTok instead of innovating themselves.",1
"Using this app is a headache !!!!! I wish Meta would permanently discontinue this app !!!! Too many glitches and unnecessary features, with ZERO PERCENT user friendly interface !!!! uploading photos, reels, videos or anything is a nightmare !!!! What use is an app if i have to use a third party app just for resizing photos in order to upload on INSTA ?!?!?! This should be an inbuilt feature. Also, you cant add/remove/edit individual photos in a post once you've uploaded it......frustrating !!!!!",1
"As many others have described, for possibly one of the most used apps, Instagram sure doesn't function very well. How does one of the biggest social media apps break constantly after a short period of being used? I have to constantly close and reopen it just for things to load properly. Very disappointing.",1
"This app was once great, now I can't be signed into this app on multiple devices without being signed out every time i grab another device of mine. The app forces me to reset my password practically every week. The glitches of my notifications not working is becoming a problem. This app was once a top app. I feel people will soon be ready for the next big photo sharing app. This one is done.",1
"CRASHING! Constantly. My news feed has been blank for days, and there is no way to easily report the issue through the app or the store, other than emailing. I updated and the issues are still there. Frustrating!!! What is happening!?!",1
"Why does this app always give me experimental features for a short while and then make them disappear for no reason. I was loving the notes feature on the messages screen but now it's gone meanwhile all my friends have it. Not to mention how straight up buggy this app can be sometimes, not displaying stories correctly, reshaping my posts as I'm posting them, really falling off this app.",1
I recently started using Instagram to start posting content with newly streaming on Twitch. The two-factor authentication won't send me a text... I've done everything possible and gave the app basically unlimited access to my phone and yet no SMS. Will change amount of stars if I ever get it... And yes it should be sent to the correct phone # but I'm literally locked out of the account unable to sign it until I get the SMS to authenticate my account,1
"Dec2022 update: impossible to rotate pics for posts ü§° The latest update is absolutely horrible. I don't need neither reels nor damn shopping buttons (I open instagram for content not for shopping!), new version of posting stories and regular posts is terrible as well. Also, I lost all my drafts with this update! I really regret I did not disable auto update feature for this app. Gonna struggle now for getting back to the previous version",1
Totally glitchy in stories section. Someone fix this asap. Sometimes randomly undo button just deletes everything you have done in the 'scribble mode'. Drafts done recover anything from scribble mode. Only the photo remains. This section has so much potential and i keep losing work I've created cos it's so glitchy,1
"A couple issues, starting with the fact I stopped getting notifications, then would randomly get shadow banned out of nowhere, to only one of my accounts being able to see notes The final straw to me writing this review and giving it the one star is the fact that it keeps signing me out and every time I try to sign in, I'm just given some excuse that an error occurred and that's it Still cannot sign in which is highly disappointing, if it can't be fixed I'll have to leave the app",1
"One of the most used apps in the world and it is absolutely incompetent in uploading content. Slow, and almost does incorrectly every time without failure. This app isn't about sharing pictures anymore, it's about algorithms and storing everyone's data.",1
It's been like 4 to 5 months and I'm not able to see my archived stories neither I'm able to edit my highlights!!!... It's not about my network connection cause when I'm using another account on the same device with the same network there's no such any issue but when I try doing that on my account.... Why the hell i can't see my stories! I hv been reporting the same issue since ages but still the problem persists... Totally disappointed by the service you provide!,1
"Completely locked out - My authenticator disappeared after a phone reset. The security selfie recognition tool is completely useless as it doesn't recognise me and there's no direct customer service contact to get my account back. Security is tight, but there needs to be more options to verify ID. It's just ridiculous.",1
"Whenever I try to leave a comment on a post, it shows a mostly plain when screen and the area to edit text isn't there. As soon as I dismiss the keyboard, it shows the comments again and the text that I made before posting. This really isn't optimal. Please fix this :(",1
"I really wanted to give instagram a great review because after all it's supposed to be a great option for socializing; however, my experience has been far from pleasant. My notification claims I have 19 messages but when I click on the message icon nothing shows up. I have reported the problem so many times and still nothing has been resolved.. hope you can fix this so I can change my review.",1
"Please, Stop suspending my account by accident! It's been 5 times in one day, and always get the email that it's done by mistake on Instagrams behalf! Changing the password everytime I check my account and it's exhausting. Also please fix posting multiple pictures option. I know you are focusing more on reels but the basic features need to work. Aaand I always have unread message marked, which I don't have. This year is not starting well for Instagram üôà",1
Everytime I open the app the chats they always come late. Let's say a week then 2 weeks after or even it never notifies me who texts and even when i do text it deletes itself and i have to type it in again. But not just that on my other account it gets updates and better versions it also gets the messages faster then the main account. I already reported what happened and it still didn't fixed. You need to fix it Instagram it has been a problem since last year that I have been trying to fix,1
"Don't really understand why it'll delete someone's account without any warning (especially when all that person does is like car/motorcycle pages so like, breaking guidelines where??) And refuses to send through a verification code so they can attempt to recover the account. Cheers üñï",1
Serious issues in the last days with my professional profile dropping and Instagram asking me to set it up again. I currently have an ad running and can't check the stats. Using website version in interim but Instagram fix it!!,1
Recently the app has just stopped working. Cannot open the app without it just showing a black screen and freezing my phone for a number of minutes. Deleted the app and will probably delete my account!,1
"This app keeps on logging me out and telling me that ""the account owner (which is me) changed the password"" every time I log in from my other devices and I don't know if this has anything to do with the update that just came out yesterday but it is EXTREMELYYY annoying",1
"My account has not been updated. I have reported so many times but you haven't responded yet. I have zero features in my account. No message swiping, no message reply, no chat theme, no notes, nothing is available in my account. Worst experience.",1
I've been issues ALL day trying to upload a video... it let's me submit it only to not start the downloading process so it can post.. I've uninstalled/reinstalled the app MULTIPLE times today and sent TWO reports about it..,1
"Everything is running great.But just like the others,my account does not have the messenger update.I can't reply to messages or react to them.All my friends have the update only I don't.My other account on the same device has the updated dm feature but the one I use mostly doesn't.Please developers fix this issue asap or you will continue to loose your app users.",1
"I post pictures of the jewelleries and sell them to my customers. Sad to reveal, 2 days back many of my pictures were having issues on uploading. Some were not getting uploaded. Some got uploaded but later it was removed by Instagram and some were put under review exclaiming my photos are against the COVID informations. My question, how a jewellery photos can spread misleading information against COVID-19. I put them on review, but still I received same answer and my monetization stopped.",1
"Glitches while texting. The ""send"" button disappears while typing messages in a direct message. Other glitches in the app and poor maintenance makes it frustrating to use this app. Don't really expect Meta to look into anything so I'm rating this mess a 1 star. Porn accounts, bots and scams, people using the n word and other slurs can get away undetected, and my reports go ignored because the devs are ""busy"", but my comments get deleted for simply calling out a fake account or arguments?",1
It's a good app but the only issue I have with Instagram is that I can't view my gallery meaning that I can't post on my stories nor post a regular post because I can't view my gallery. I've restarted and uninstalled and clear the Instagram cache and it didn't work. I don't know if it's a bug problem but please get it fixed.,1
"I really hate what you did lastly, you mixed between reels and videos and that's makes me uncomfortable with it! please return the version which reels in option of reels and videos in option of videos!",1
Very bad experience..!! It isn't working properly and I'm not able to add music on my story there are lot of issues..!!,1
"The app keeps crashing whenever I try to go to my profile. Can't even report a damn problem because there's a bug in the app (my phone literally tells me there's a bug). Apparently the bug stops the shake to report a problem from working too. I know I have it turned on and yet it doesn't respond. So this is my best way to let you people know because the place to access the option to report a problem is in settings, ON THE PROFILE PAGE!",1
"Can't do login without Facebook account, can't find account, can't even log into with password reset. The only way is to log on web browser, meaning you don't need the app for.",1
"No permissions are given to this app to access anything besides the camera and pictures, yet every time I search for something on Google, I see ads instantly the next time I open Instagram for the thing I searched for. Clearly a data and privacy breach. They censor any conservative source but allow racist anti white speech through their entire app.",1
I'm not able to download any video by adding music to it and downloading it from my story....and worst updated Instagram ever because every after entering my email or phone number to find my account it shows no account found when the account is formed using the same number and email which i used to create the account and I updated the app twice but still its the same issue and i have not opened my account for past 5 days this is the worst updated Instagram ever please take this issue seriously.,1
"Such a pathetic app ! My Instagram was and still hacked, despite frequent reporting & frequent selfie video verification, around 3 times in a interval of one month, not much of action has been taken and still in the control of hacker. Insta system has reset mail id of myself while not changing phone number to mine and still of the hacker, thus allowing my personal insta to accessed by hacker and me myself uable to login due to two step verification.Disappointed user ! Bug in system!",1
"I'm really disappointed, I'm Indian living in kinshasa rdc , and feature of music is not available in this region. Everytime my friends update something with Instagram music in it , i can't listen that music , it's really fustrating , i hate this , Instagram must improve and must look after this problem.",1
Instagram has been horrible lately lots of bugs lately when I upload a reel and try to play it a different reel will play and it will be the same reel for the first two rows I've uninstalled the app twice and it's still doing it it's pretty aggravating,1
"I had Instagram for about 7 years now and over time it has just gotten worse and worse. One Frame image while audio is still playing, messages not being sent right away, constant unnecessary updates to the point where the app itself is broken now. I logged out of an account and wanted to log back into it but all it shows is a blank white screen. Uninstalling and reinstalling does NOTHING. Fix this for android please!",1
Instagram always has problems it's like it never works properly why can't it be fixed for once Instagram shouldn't be having this many problems it's ridiculous it's like they don't care to fix it I'm tired of not being able to see pictures my friends send me through dm it literally says can't load image like why does it do this I'm having issues with my Instagram messages loading it's being slow please fix the problem I tried everything,1
"Since the latest update I cannot even log in! All I keep getting is a popup error message telling me to try again. Tell me, how many megabytes is this app? In the old days all that could have been written in 3 - 4 lines of Basic code!",1
"Keeps asking me to verify my phone number with a 6 digit code that it just won't send to me from a Privacy Policy that isn't even supposed to take effect until Jan 1st. I've even tried to use a friend's number just in case it was just my phone, but no dice. They haven't gotten sent a code either. It's been like this for 3 days so far. I've had this account for years and it's never asked me to do this.",1
This app is getting worse by the day. I can no longer see the hashtags I follow and I can no longer see my follow list sorted by the 3 options. I honestly don't know why they add features just to take them away. Someone needs to fix this app.,1
"New update is worstüòñüòñüòñüòñüòñüòñ You can't reply messages by swipe right,and don't even have options to react üòñüòñüòñüòñ Just fix it, it's a vere useless and worst update so please undo it first . What's the point of using this app if we can't reply specifically. And every them of your chat screen is not available for new update. Settings them of your chat screen is the one of the best features and you just remove it. So please fix this nonsense updated and make it as earlier, because it is worst",1
Keyboard covering text when we are in reel & want to comment on it. But when we are on dashboard and if we want to write comment it works properly. means: when write comment option comes to the right side it doesn't work properly and keyboard cover the textbox. But when write comment option is on bottom side it works properly. it's a big bug which need to be fixed as early as possible.,1

"My son's account was hacked and Instagram's assistance was non-existent. There was no way to request support because the hacker had gotten in and set up the two factor authentication to go to his account and mobile. If I didn't have to have this app for work, I wouldn't.",1
Regularly fails to work properly .Have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling to see any posts! Really annoying. The date of this review is wrong it was 29 /9 /22 UPDATE. this is still happening 30/10/22 Have contacted @instagram many times and no reply or improvement.,1
"I don't like Instagram. It's impossible to share posts on your feed with just text. You can only do that as a story, which lasts for a while before it goes away forever. I know this isn't Twitter, but it also isn't fun, either, in my opinion. I'm only here as a last refuge. I would like to find a better social media, but this is just making do for now.",1
Seriously now a days insta is giving me soo much trouble.. M Experiencing too much bugs... I can't even see my previous messages I got from my friends and I get notifications but I don't see the chats in my chat feed and m missing soo much things..

Unable to see anything in the app since last nothing is loading not even my own profile is being loaded since 2-3 Days. It's just stuck on. Very bad experience. Kindly look into the glitch and solve immediately.,1
"Wasting my time doing many things on this app, but it's still reporting as couldn't refresh feed... Again & Again irritating me this one. Uploading is not working properly. Totally wasting my time. Still continues on December 2022. Can't even they have time to respond again...",1
"The app is unstable. Features are constantly removed. When i create reels and add text. It comes out scrambled or mixed together. I had to delete many posts. My collaborator option randomly disappeared. Drafts save randomly. When deleted, it removes the actual post, when i never even saved the draft. Too many glitches. I am really disappointed with the app. Recent uodates removes features or features starts working erratically.",1
"This version is so glitchy. The search bar never loads and I constantly have to reopen the app. Clicking ""reply"" on a post glitches and does nothing, have to restart the app. Why are none of the features working?",1
Can't log back in!!! I was logged out because apparently someone tried to hack my account. So Instagram is trying to send me a email with a code but it never comes through and there is no way to get a hold of anyone about it. Please fix the issue so I can use my account,1
"My issue, I am not receiving notifications on my phone. The settings are set in both the app/phone but I am still not getting any notifications. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Is anyone else having the same issue?",1
"Worst experience. There are many features which are not available for my account via. (pin comments on my post), (reply option in chat)etc. It's so irritating; the support is also just useless, no replies. I am very disappointed with the service from Instagram team.",1
My Instagram is not working not opening every time I use to open th app it's just show story of other people and when I try to open not working blank screen . I thought that might be due to internet issue but everything works fine even on wifi same.,1
I struggle my butt of to get to the bottom of my saved posts. I have over 20k saved posts. I'm limited because Instagram doesn't have a scroll button. I drag and drag by the time I reach the bottom it glitches. I'm getting frustrated with the network infrastructure as well. I can afford 5g but it's not available in my area how many decades do I have to wait till I'm same as the rest of the world,1
"Black Screen of Death I was unable to upload videos to Instagram and it was glitching out and not uploading at all, so I though to delete app data/cache so it would fix it, instead I get onto a perpetual black screen, restarting does nothing. Updating the app to this current version seems to make it happen. I think it is supposed to be the login screen as it logs me out when I enter the app after updating it. It appreciate Meta to fix this as this fully breaks the app.",1
App keeps freezing since last update. Both in app or when loading - the initial image with Instagram - Meta appears on a small part of screen...then stays blocked...then increases a little...blocks again and so on(on samsung galaxy s22),1
"I keep getting blocked from liking posts, and everytime the ban ends it starts over for another week. I can usually like 2 or 3 posts before getting blocked again. I have sent in numerous reports over the past month and no action has been taken.",1
I remember Instagram as one of the best functioning social media. But lately this has changed with the frequent updates. Lots of bugs and errors. I love Instagram as it was in 2020. It's hard to use this app for business nowadays. Cause of the bugs and hard to post cause of being stuck and going back to home screen. Just lots of bugs.,1
"my account got disabled for no reason. I opened the app without doing anything else, and found out it was suspended, then i tried doing the request for review, it wasn't letting me to submit the picture i was uploading for approval. Bring it back, there are my important chats and posts that might be gone, FOREVER. Fix your system please.",1
"Facing frequent issue of Instagram not working properly... whenever I open Instagram it's load few posts , stories , msgs, reels for few seconds and after that posts, stories, msgs , reels doesn't load...facing this issue from last 20 days or more",1

"I'm an artist who started posting in 2020. Originally, Instagram provided a pretty accessible ascent into the art community. I managed to get up to 10k followers in roughly two years. However, after Insta decided to try and be TikTok 2.0 (despite the fact that they're supposed about PHOTO-SHARING) and they started reels, I seriously can't grow as an account unless I want to post video content. I'm lucky if I get 100 likes on my posts now. There's just no engagement anymore. Garbage site.",1
"Hate that i am now forced to have suggestions in my feed. Also, impossible to (un)follow hashtags with Japanese characters or √•√§√∂. Please fix state management when navigating back and forth when creating a multi picture post. The app is broken in its current behavior. Also! Just by pressing edit on a picture in a series, and then touching the image (as you do to check the original) a filter is applied and there is no way to remove it.",1
"Not satisfied I only get to see low like videos or ads while scrolling reels while others don't. This make it boring to usem Earlier this was not the same, I was able to see reels properly. Respected Instagram please look into the matter and take immediate action. Instagram ID, soul_unknown_guy, Waiting for your replies.",1
"Got an issue with the new messages interface. I don't care who's currently on Instagram, who follow me/follow back. Half those people are people I barely know anymore. It's visual clutter. Ugly.",1
"Instagram has been my favorite app since a long time but the updates ,bugs and constant glitches are annoying af, also the unnecessary updates, I get that you have to be more creative but all they are doing is making it more irritable for the users.my account has been recently blocked and there was no sensible reason for this action and I haven't gone against any of the terms and uses. I'm sure many more users have gone through the same annoying experience.",1
I can't change my theme in my messages at all since it's never given me an option and I have triws everything I could to find out a way but when I updated the app I still wasn't given the option along with the other features it was supposed to give. I can't even log into insta anymore cause everytime I try all it says is failed to load in,1
I've recently lost my phone with Instagram two factor authentication app with in it and now when i am trying to log in on my Instagram on my new device the backup codes which Instagram gave me are not working now. There are two accounts with 2 factor authentication and those backup code are not working with either of them. I've already mail about this before but got no support from your end. Please help me recover my accounts.,1
No ability to reply to specific messages. All my friends in Brazil have had this feature for ages but I'm still unable to. So many bugs on my app i don't even know where to start.,1
"I just recently got logged out of my main account along with some other accounts and i can not log back in, I placed my phone number in thats connected to the account multiple times but still havent even gotten the code. Ive emailed and look for answers but found nothing that could help me and now im here crying. I love the app but i dont like how this happened so suddenly üò≠üíî",1
"I don't know what happened to this app, it is not showing me the note section. I have a gaming page so i have to upload many collab videos but this app is not allowing or showing me any collab invitation option, i have reported many times about this issue but I got no response from Instagram.",1
"They must have had an update. If you turned on the two factor authentication then you're screwed. You can have the correct number, good signal and never get the SMS. You can email them , message them , tag them in a public post and they will not respond .",1
"It's been 5months my acc is acting up.It doesn't show all the features-the add yours,music stickers,add a note.I can't see chat rooms, call history.My acc looks like the 2016 Insta.I can't reply to any particular text,react,see time at which my text was sent.It's just my main account, other accounts are working just fine.I've logged in & out,restarted my phone,uninstalled & reinstalled,cleared cache but NOTHING works.It's the same on all device.I've reported this several times but was of no use",1
"Started using this as slowly dropping twitter. Don't mind the adverts or suggestions but when you pick do not show any posts from a suggestion, you're still shown the same posts which you marked as irrelevant or asked not to show. Useless",1
With the amount of advertisement propaganda that's on here is freaking ridiculous. You can follow a family targeted page and still get advertisement about nudies and prostitutes trying to sell themselves online. The ads are they dumbest thing in the world (not just the nudy girls). Every 2-3 post you get hit with a sponsored advertisement about something that's not even remotely relevant to what you follow or what you search or any of the data that they've collected on you. Remove the ads.,1
"There are many features which are not available on my Instagram account like Shop feature. Even after updating my application its not working. And whenever I try to report for this on Instagram, the bugs starts coming. What do I do?",1

"For some reason ""NOTES"" is not working on my app. I've uninstalled it many times updated and it's still not working. I live in the u.s, so there's no way that it's not available for me. I know it's something small but damn what the hell?",1
This app is useless in case of security It first showed unnecessary warning and security threat on account and suggested to reset password but as soon as i entered the recovery code and wrote the new password it says that the code didnt work doesn't even let to reset password nor to login with previous password This is a big problem in such a popular application,1

"Used to love it. Now, not so much. If one tried unfollowing accounts and hashtags, Instagram prompted pop-ups or notifications of ""similar accounts"" or ""similar hashtags"" being followed by the user. It gave the user the fabulous option to get rid of numerous accounts in a faster and more efficient way. Nowadays, IG users are hooked on accounts they don't even remember following in the first place!!",1

Allow users to arrange their posts on their profile in any order not just by date wise. 3).

Full of glitches....I've been noticing now for a long time how unstable it has become to read all the comments in a comment thread of a post....it never shows all the comments of the thread...a lot of comments just simply disappear.... also whenever I go on to read someone's reply to my comment on a post all the other comments again get disappeared.... Also there is no option to save any reel to a particular category of saved posts....so we have no option but to save it to the common save space,1

With over 1 billion downloads and millions of daily users - why can I literally NEVER make a post without it glitching, telling me there was an unknown error, or just closing the app and forcing me to start over???

"It's been more than a month and I still can't access or go through the login page, it's just showing the logo at first and then after that it went on black screen. I've done every possible troubleshooting steps such as clearing cache/data, re-installing the app and restarting the phone but nothing worked. Please fix this.",1
"Its really hard to find any help if there is any issue with the account. I ran ad and it was not approved all of a sudden within 1 hour it is showing all the amount used. They are stealing money. Captions disappear when you post a reel. It is almost impossible to get engagement, sharing anything goes into processing for ages, it's time for another alternative of this app, the app is crashing, I'm just gonna close the prof account don't see any growth.",1
"Why can't I reply to any comments? Why is it that when I go to type a comment using my android that my keyboard covers the comment box? Also, why haven't I been able to access all of my Instagram notifications in app? Under activity, I only see likes & replies, some comments & only a few notifications, but not all of them, so unless I manually go to pages I follow, I miss alot. A response would be appreciated as despite everything I've tried to do in all settings, nothing has helped.",1
"Since July I have not been able to post reels. Whenever I try to post a reel I get an error message that says there was an error, please try again later. I have tried all sorts of things, like Uninstalling the ap and reinstalling it, still. Is there someone else experiencing the same problem and how have u resolved it? I would really appreciate some help on this as it is really frustrating.",1
"Algorithm is useless. Has stuff on the home page that should be on the explore - in fact, that's what makes up most of the home page. Massive unnecessary focus on reels just so it can try to be tiktok (most are just reuploaded tiktoks anyways). Even automatically makes any videos into reels. Can't even upload photos rn because the only photos that come up are photos already posted",1
"Can not edit messages, can not reply, videos and images take too long to be sent. Got suspended for no reason with no apparent way to recover my account as I am not being prompted to do so, instead it just says ""error"" or wrong password, but my account simply isnt there",1
Bugs and bugs! Not being able to react to messages .only like button is available. Cannot see the notes feature.not responding to feedbacks.,1

"This app has lot of glitches. Something frame size automatically gets shroten, sometimes what you upload gets reverse, sometimes you get your followers decreased. Seems insta is not able to handle its publicity itself!",1
"Soooo buggy. Every other day there's a new issue. Also a lot of stuff on one acc won't work on another, if it wasn't such a high traffic app I'd think this was some low rated new app with low budget and no testers.",1
"You guys are mean and simply wicked with zero customer service. All you're after is to make money from people without a care for delivering quality services to them. How do you disable multiple pages time after time without even an explanation of the reason for disabling it. After collecting thousands in ads fees from me, I wake up one morning & all my hard work is gone without an explanation. I can't wait to be rid of you guys.",1
"Cannot login to app....I get an ""Unknown Network error"" everytime. There is nothing wrong with my phone, network, WiFi etc as everything else is working fine and I can log in via browser but the app is dead for me",1

This app is getting worse every day. When you found something interesting in the middle of all the trash in this social media the app refresh and there is no way to found the video you was watching.,1
App works well enough to share photos and videos with people. Add new features nobody asked for all the time that never get used. Do nothing about fake/scam accounts that are being made all the time.,1
I am giving only one star because i am facing a different kind of problem... I cannot search any bollywooed music on my id @masha_65drdz. Let me explain this: whenever i search any bollywood music it shows no result found and even i cannot search any english songs. This app is making me to use only those songs which are given..please resolve this issue üôèüôè,1
I had already complain several time about the messaging featured is not update Still they don't reply or solve the problem If any of the developer is reading this than he/she must be take some action & reply me on my email account or provide a updated version And for the kind disclaimer to the developer that the solution which is shown by the app is not showing in my account..

"This app has good interface and other things which a social media platform must have. But, they don't have a good customer care service which is annoying. My Instagram ID has been disabled without any reason. I tried to send them mail and to get their contact number but nothing worked. They don't even responded to my mail. It's been a week and still no reply.",1
"When I first download it has the like and post buttons at the bottom (ah, ehat find memories) and saves any drafts i make. As soon as I add other accounts it changes the version to the one where shop button is where the like button was. It then no longer saves my drafts. If I view a reel if I click to view others on the same profile it keeps repeating the same reel.",1
Accounts on Instagram are getting easily hacked and Instagram do not take any kind of action they can neither recover the hacked account nor can they report it. Seriously it's very disappointing. They should at least delete the hacked account in order to protect someone's privacy and identity. Very very disappointing,1
Keeps crashing and videos don't or play properly they keep stopping it's lagging when a new version comes out my private profile updates but my main doesn't exits the app on it's own takes forever when i want to edit my profile like change a picture the list goes on used to be my favorite app but I am slowly losing interest because it keeps making me angry a person idk if they deactivated their acc or blocked me or just what ever but i thought they blocked me but it's just the app didn't worküò¶,1

I have been using Instagram for years. I don't normally log in and out of the app I just leave it open because I use it a lot. Today I decided to log out and log back in creating a new password. I have been locked out of my Instagram account I tried every way to get back in. It keep saying try again later. I am very frustrated and I fear that I will loose my Instagram page and all of my content. I don't know what else to do. Please help,1
"algorithm for feed randomly broke. app is only showing me content from accounts with no likes and followers and then tries to sell me something every second post. my ""discover"" feed is nothing but ads and posts with 0 likes. like my scrolling fell off a highway and landed in a ditch",1

"Everytime I download the app it only shows a blank screen. I have tried to delete and re-download it, I have closed the app and opened it many times . I even restarted my phone more times than I could count and I still cannot use it without seeing a blank screen everytime. This was going on for days but this issue has yet to be fixed . Please fix this.",1
"De-rated it to 1 star. The help team doesn't respond , I'm having a problem and reported it to Insta Help, got no response and the problem wasn't solved. I'm unable to react on Instagram messages except liking, i tried reinstalling the app, cleared the cache, force stopped , my android app is also in the latest version but nothing helped. Solve the problem ASAP and get back the 5 stars.",1
"Usually, I would give Instagram 5 stars, but today is one of those days where you only get 1 star from me. Why, you ask, I can't post my 8K videos from my phone Instagram. The app crashes every time attemp to post a reel. IG has yet to catch up with the times.",1
Each time same video playing while clicking on other reel. Very bad performance by Instagram. Many more errors. No history was cleared after clearing.,1
"Please fix the glitches. I have made my i id recently and most the features are not working eg. Can't reply to any text or reel or post, emojis are not available for text, its not showing the option for theme.",1
"Been using Instagram for many years without any problems. The past two days I can't even access my account. Every time I go to the app I get a black screen. Have tried updating, uninstall/reinstall, and numerous YouTube videos following tech instructions. Nothing has worked and I can't even use the app, just get a black screen. Rating is from past two days, before that I would give it 5 stars. It really was a good app before.",1
"Ive loved this app for like 10 years but it's now turned into TV with the unavoidable brainwashing, i mean there is way way way way too many ads and theres more every month it seems. And we all know that tv is dead because of ads. I dont tolerate brainwash in any of the internet i use.",1
"When I go to post a story that is a video, and it breaks it up into segments, only the first posts. The rest say ""error"". Extremely frustrating",1
"App crashes continuously. Does not open. I've had the app for about seven years now and the quality keeps going down, but now I can't even open the app anymore. I'm going to uninstall al reinstall the app in hopes that this fixes the problem, but please work on the app's quality. This shouldn't be on us the audience, but on you the app makers.",1
It does not solve any problem that has been reported . I am continously facing a problem . I have reported it many times but it does not solve it . Whenever i follow some account it will automatically unfollow that account and shows a popup messege of certain activity . I want it to solve this problem .,1
"I keep getting blocked from liking a commenting for 'sharing my information with sites that get you more likes and followers' but I don't post anything and only follow friends. It constantly asks me to reset my password and if I click forgot password it crashes and I lose access for a couple days. I don't know why, I only like content, barely ever comment and barely follow new people. It's such a pain to use. I'm editing this review, because less then a month later, I am still dealing with this.",1
"1. Video quality looks like üí©. 2. A lot of bugs in post creation flow: 2.1. selection photo from galary (the first photo is always selected) 2.2. reordering works wrong 2.3. sometimes images are rescaled (dialogonally) 2.4 last image always flashing (blinking) 3. Paging in messages is lagging. 4. Sometime it shows ""no internet connection"" when everything is okay. 5. Drafts just sucks. 6. Photo ratio resizes when more then 1 photo selected. And many others issues... I can show and proof.",1
"Full of ads and chicks who only care about likes...Nothing social really! Need to be logged in to see PUBLIC profiles which doesn't make any sense, as they are supposed to be public! You cannot pause their videos which is really lame! I've just had two ads in a row while looking at the stories.",1
"I have a public, business account (lilkenxoxo) and I need my content to have a good reach but Instagram isn't allowing me to collaborate with different artists and it is inhibiting my account's growth, I've even written a report twice, and it hasn't changed. Please fix this.",1
"Why is instagrams layout and messaging layout changing every half an hour for the past two to three days? Themes in messages keep disappearing same as reactions to messages. Where the reels button, post button and store button have moved at least 7 times in the last 24 hours alone. It's driving me up the wall.",1
"So many glitches. Even on refreshing the page multiple times, the page does not display the notifications. It's really disappointing.",1
"I can't log in after i changed my password two times and yet i still can't get my account open !, Is there a way for me to complained directly to their support center without having to read their useless and not so useful help center??, I just want my account to get removed and not use this app for awhile if their customer service is so poor like this..",1
"So Many Bugs! This app used to be fantastic and is now impossible to use. Will edit a photo and it will be posted with none of the edits I've made, despite multiple attempts to repost.",1
"There are so many fishy ads been shown up here which leads to stealing money without your authorization if you try buying that stuff. Instagram is becoming the main sites for scams and online theft. The app isn't even reliable anymore, as it keeps freezing and causing delays in messages and feeds. Instagram since Meta update has been garbage.",1
"Use to be good. Now you can not stop videos from playing, from every second post being an advertisement, constant spam from bots and scammers. This photo based app is dying a horrible death amd it's about time it was replaced with something focusing on what people want, not what makes you the most money",1
"Dont know what's wrong with this app, but I recently had to uninstall and install it again, and since then I'm not able to react on direct messages on this app. And now there is the default airplane icon when you wana open your message instead of the new messenger icon. How to fix It for Android users?",1
"I do not have the option to make a reel or post a reel at all, so there are only 3 options post story and live, no option for reel at all. I need this fixed right away because I need the reel option in my Instagram.",1
The android version has less function than apple version. And also it usually has bugs and error. It always has error when i try to sign in the existing accounts in other device.,1
"my Instagram dms aren't working. I receive notifications of dms but when I open the app I see no dms. To see the dms I have to reopen the app again and again and it's so annoying. I can clearly see the other person typing but I don't receive any message unless I reopen the app. Kindly fix this bug Instagram, don't make Instagram app difficult to use.",1
"I have been trying to log into accounts and it gives me the same story. ""The username that you have entered doesn't seem to appear to belong to an account...""and these accounts are existing! Correct passwords have been inputed. What exactly is going on?",1
"So i need to create content but I can't add collaborators from one of my account, the button just disappeared. Even if there's some community guidelines violation, I'm unable to ask for review because there's no option in the app to do so. I have reported so many profiles for nudity, harrassment and exploitation, even spamming but they apparently don't go against Instagram's guidelines, me writing ""bish"" in my friends post does. This app is increasing becoming glichty and full with bugs !!!!",1
Just uninstalled it as the reels are so buggy. Insta wants us to make more reels but I've just made one twice now and it's uploaded completely different to what was saved with formatting unreadable so a complete waste of time. I'm shocked at how buggy it is for such a mega platform. Please make it better. I like Instagram please don't ruin the experience. Update: Just reinstalled it and reels are entirely missing! So I've dropped rating to 1/5 as no idea if can fix.,1
"Good in all the things but from some time i am not getting the notifications of messages, getting notifications but when I am using it. I have tried all the things like - log off, reinstall, reset cache, reset all the settings, but still facing the problem please help me my girlfriend is not in good mood. Please help me.",1
The app constantly implodes on itself making it useless and frustrating to use. I've wasted a lot of time opening and closing the app hoping it will fix it since no one else seems to be working on it. Another annoyance is their refusal to fix their cropping issues. An ongoing complaint from users that no one in the company has addressed. Quality goes down when money goes up.,1
i am not able to react on the messages. Even though i have reinstalled the app several times it is still showing me the old features instead of new ones. insta team Fix the bugs ....,1
"I can't run ads because the app says there's a problem and the appeal button just keeps saying ""There was a problem with this request. We're working on getting it fixed as soon as we can."" So frustrating üòî",1
"For whatever reason my Instagram is no longer working, and hasn't for some time. I have updated the app to no avail. I have uninstalled and then again reinstalled the app, again to no avail. Just keeps saying couldn't refresh my feed? Whatever that means...What gives?",1
"I love Instagram. But Instagram has some serious problem with me i think. I updated my Instagram several times and I still didn't get any Instagram new updates, I'm still posting 1m video on my stories with 4cuts (15sec each) I didn't even get that notes update or anything. This is so annoying.",1
"I uninstalled the app to try to fix my problem of not being able to use the ""add yours"" feature and now my Instagram is weird. I dont have chat themes anymore, I can't reply to messages, and when I react to messages I cannot use the emojis I would like to use. Instagram needs to fix this before I stop using Instagram.",1
Why is my Instagram not verifying my account. I did the 2 step verification and all it does is stay stuck loading. I think you developers need to look into why and how these things happen. You got to step up your cybersecurity program or something cause now you gonna probably loose millions of people to these errors if you dont take action pronto! I uninstalled and now it's not recognizing my information. Looks like I got hacked!,1
"Every update is worse. We don't want comments popping up in the reels. We cannot see replies. Why does meta suck so badly lol. These updates make me really hate all of meta. It's garbage ad and sales tactic without even attempting to make the app enjoyable. Also, so many features just don't work. Garbage.",1
"My Instagram is not working properly as other's do. Sone features are not working like in the chat i not able to tag a specific msg, responses are not available i can only like a msg but can't react with other emojis. Pls fix the issue. Firstly i thought that i will be fixed with the update but no it hadn't. Now it's been enough time i waitedüòÆ‚Äçüí®üò¢. Pls do something.",1
"My account was hacked and they set up 2-factor verification up on my account, locked me out, and extorted me for $200 USD. I've reported and reported and reported with absolutely NO help with the problem! NOT EVEN ONE GD E-MAIL!!! NO TEXT NO CALL NOTHING! THE HELP CENTER IS 10000000% USELESS!!!",1
Have been experiencing an issue where only a blank screen is shown after the logo when opening the app. This has been happening since I first re-downloaded the app a week ago. It seems Instagram does not care that this error is affecting thousands of people. Nothing is being done to rectify this issue and nothing I do to try fix it is working.,1
"I have updated my Instagram but after some times it works as a old instagram... I can't react or reply any msg or reel from friend, and reels option was disappear.... I faced this problem 2-3 times. This is a big glitch. Please fix it...",1
"Hi, I have a problem of saving audios from some of the reels which are official and it's becoming a problem as I post reels by using other audios. And if I search for a song while posting a story there are no songs which I search for and is showing ""NO RESULTS FOUND""and is bugging a lot if I use a song and suddenly closes the Instagram, kindly fix this as soon as possible. thank you.",1
"App has gone down hill, it keeps giving posts from people I don't even follow and it keeps putting topics I have no interest in. I tried using the ""not interested"" features and I also tried blocking but they keep popping up, why put no interested if it doesn't work.",1
"Most worst app of my life. Can't use many features like invite collaborater, reply, watching reels, switching privacy, reading dms and etc. I reported several times but nothing changed. If Instagram don't known how to handle users or app so just stop and quite. I want my time back which i spended on fixing bugs and glitches. If at any chance insta team is reading my views so fix your app as soon as possible please.",1
"Hi Instagram Team, Someone hacked my Instagram account and they changed all the needed things that is password,mail id,mobile number for this user name - kushi_buds .Kindly, block my account (user name - Kushi_buds). This is my request Instagram team you should add this option in Instagram application, you must add verification code for changing the mail id and mobile in Instagram application once the verification is done then only the mail id, mobile number will change. Thank you Team",1
"Fails to display any pictures or videos ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Used to be ok, and this never happened but the last few updates it's appeared and for worse and worse. Possibly going to retrieve any images off another device and close the account. No point keeping anything if the app is useless. Also so many ads. There's no option to select whose feeds you see first ie friends rather than some commercial nonsense. Typical algorithm.",1
It was a good app but now from past few days this app is not running properly. Unable to send any message. I have reported many times but still the issue persist. If this gets fixed I can change my mind to give 5 stars to this this.,1
"Very disappoint from last update . Many features is missing,. Couldn't save videos with song . Kindly look into the matter in next update",1
"Why are there just random ""notes"" on the messages place?? Remove the notes, they are annoying, or at least add a setting to turn them on/off, because this is just something no one wants.",1
My insta is running on a much older version which doesn't allow even basic options like replying to a massage or reacting.This issue is very annoying and disappointing.Solve this issue as soon as possible.,1
"Nowadays, Experience for this app is getting worst . Day by day. It doesn't show unread text...if u send a msg to anybody it show that u have send it but otherside they can't get it. This happen with u when somebody send u. you are not getting that at that time after refreshing too. It can't help u outüò©üò©",1
"It's like the developers don't even care about making the app functional, I can't barely ever post anything. Everything always crashes all of the time, filters lag, posts mess up. It's all so bad",1
It's been so long that I'm facing many issues regarding this app. I'm not able to use this smoothly. I'm always facing bug issues. And also I'm not able to see the view count of my story that I post. Please I hope you'll clear these issues soonüôèüèª,1
"Updated 2 days ago, can't upload anything to Instagram now. Have cleared my cache, turned phone off/on. Deleted loads of files to ensure plenty of free storage. Tried everything I can think of.. Just won't work. App is entirely useless at this point. It's been glitchy as hell for months, & keeps force-feeding me stuff I'm not interested in, & is so weighed down with ads its ridiculous. Not what it once was - not even a pale shadow of it. I'm an artist, I simply want to share photos of my work!",1
"I find an error message ""post not found"" when communicating with a friend even if I didn't send anything but messages I wrote. Am I hacked or is it some kind of an erreur on the app? Ps: I find that message in my conversation with that one friend ! What's going on?!",1
"It can't login and the notifications always says ""Please wait a few minutes before you try again"" but i just have one account and rarely log out while using intagram. It's very bad apps.",1
"Basically Useless. Between the app attempting to be tiktok and becoming a tiktok dump site for most people, wrecking everyone's algorithms so they can't see what they want/follow and in turn also don't get seen. The app is broken for a lot of people including myself for the last few weeks. I see a blank screen when I open the app. Restarting/reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, using data or WiFi, clearing the cache, nothing works to fix this and IG haven't made any type of statement.",1
messages aren't loading and i have to shut down the app at least 5 times before the messages load. messages also disappear from my screen when i send them but the receiver can see them.,1
My DMs are not working properly since forever. Not able to reply to individual messages whereas other friends are able to. There's no emoji reacts that I can do to message either in my insta unlike other people's. My insta is 100 % updated but Still doesn't function well,1
"I use Instagram a lot, especially the IG Story feature to the point that I even included it in my daily schedule. The issue is that when I add text or stickers to my Instagram story, when it is about to upload, the text/stickers is somewhat distorted and has an unattractive black and occasionally green outline. This problem usually affects android phones, and I`m not sure when it started happening to others, but mine started after I updated the app for the August 24, 2022 update.",1
A TON of spam accounts and basically doesn't want you to post pictures only reels so I stopped posting completely. I can't see the bar where you write out comments if my keyboard is up. The app is going downhill. Anyone I meet doesn't like it anymore. Don't waste your time with it honestly,1
The experience for this app is so bad. The Instagram notifications that I get is actually unbelievable. I get the most unless and unnecessary notifications. I turned it off but it still shows the notifications that I turned off. Fix your app Instagram smh,1
"Re downloaded this app a month ago and whenever I click on it, all I get is a white screen. Every time. I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times. I've restarted my phone every time I've reinstalled. To say it's an app that everyone uses, it's a bit disappointing when Ive heard multiple people have the same issue",1
"1) I have a professional Instagram account, i suddenly lost all the rights on it when i created Facebook page which Instagram itself recommended. I need to login from meta inorder to get all rights back but i couldn't login at all. It always says login error. 2) i am boasting a post for 24 hours which is 165-166 INR. It is taking 21 hours for reviewing and then in 3 hours all the 165 is spent. Why not 24 hours time start once after review is done? So many bugs and it's making hard to use app",1
I have been facing a bug since 7-8 months...i am not able to give reply and react on messages during the conversation...i have reported this bug multiple time...but did not receive any response from Instagram...i am really irritated with this issue.,1
I'm unable to upload any reels!!!! A lott offf glitches in the app ....its not working in a flexible way! I am facing trouble!! Due to this ... Not a single reel i have uploaded!!!! Trying ....since yesterday!! But havent seen any difference yet!! Hope you fix my problem soonn!!!! üò°üò°,1
"Instagram can't log me in any account. It says there's no account with this username/email, and this applies to any account. I have deleted cache n data, nothing! I have uninstalled, reinstalled, yet nothing! This is too frustrating üò°",1
After upgrading to the samsung galaxy z fold 3 things just dont seen to fit properly. You can watch or view pics just the same as before but the aspect ratio is all off almost as if things are zoomed in some text is difficult to read because the start/end of words are out of the screen. If i press and hold on anything in the search tab it just brings up a tiny window that is almost impossible to view. With phone in folded mode its better but tablet mode is nearly unusable.,1
I don't have access to an old number that is associated with my account. I've tried to log in with my new phone and number and I can't because the two step verification is still attached to my old number. Instagram makes it impossible to fix this issue.,1
"messages broken completely. notifications send hours late. resend notifications for things I've already seen. no, it's not power saving mode. Confusing UI.",1
"I've seen how other countries have multiple options in chats, while in the vertion of instagram my country have I can't even reply to a certain menssage. It's ridiculous to not have these types of basics chat freatures in every vertion of the app, really doesn't help in anything.",1
"Approximately 9 times i have reported my problem that I am unable to collaborate or see collaboration option, they didn't fix it at all rather I lost the reels option too now ... And instagram doesn't help with any glitches I have ever faced till now..",1
"Every update makes this app worse. I can barely find the post button, there are way too many ads, the selfie camera has a beauty filter ü§Æ, there are suggested posts on my feed??? What used to be a fun app for friends is now filled with despairing content creators trying to work out how to get anyone to see their posts",1
"nowhere near as good as it used to be. stories are pointless and now they've ditched the frames. getting more and more like the god awful farcebook by the day Update 03/11/22: uploading a post does not work. Can only upload a story. There is no longer any buttons to decide how I want to post. Fair enough, you don't want me to use your awful app? Ok, then I won't. Screw you and your ""meta"" overlords",1
Can you make it so i stop receiving likes in insta direct instead of making me stop receiving notifications from direct as a whole? Been years guys why is it still not there? WHY THE HELL ARE YOU SUGGESTING OLD FRIENDS POSTS I HAVE ALREADY SEEN?! Make it more clear and simpler to remove SUGGESTIONS. If you could make it so I can stop getting these notifications without blocking all notifications. MAKE IT SO YOU CAN SHARE ADS ON YOUR STORY!!!,1
"I have been constantly trying to sign up an account and it has failed, ''requsted couldnt be completed, try again later'' all this has now been a month when i cant sign an account, it so frustrating . Please fix everything about your app because it sucks right now",1
"Everything was working fine until suddenly notes option disappeared from my account. Now there is no notes section for me use. Even after reporting 2 times, the problem has not been resolved. THIS IS PATHETIC, INSTAGRAM",1
"Was working great with my Pixel 7 Pro up until this week... Now it won't load pictures and just freeze's... I've signed out & back in a few times, uninstalled & reinstalled a few times... Nothing works! What happened?",1
There is a bug when uploading multiple photos. It keeps showing the first one but on the filters it shows the actual photo you want to adjust....,1
"I think instagram is getting worse and worse. I was just unfollowing some accounts then the next thingI see is the ""your account has been compromised"" message and then I tried to get my account back (and still trying to get my account back) but it tells me that the old password is incorrect, like really, why did this happen now ? And the funny thing is that I didn't use those apps that let you see who unfollowed you and stuff and I didn't post anything that would not respectInstagram'sGuidelines",1
Reset my phone and now I can't log into my other accounts except my main one. I used to be able to. It says the usernames don't belong to any accounts but I can log in using a browser just fine. Even uninstalling and re installing has it locked to my main account. Annoying!,1
"App allows you to mix and match photos with different aspect ratios, only to be warped by the compression algorithm. Please fix.",1
I deleted Instagram bc of some personal issues and now I can't login to my acc anymore. It's just keep showing error or the username you entered does not appear to belong to an account. I forgot my password so I am trying to reset it but I can't. And of course I clicked the 'can't reset your password?' button several times but it doesn't work as well.,1
"I am not able to create a new account. There's alot of glitch. Many people are facing it. Sometimes it shows a white blank screen. I thought it would be better in few days, I tried many times but Nothing happens.",1

"Update: 10/31/2022 After months of crashes, blank images, and glitching the app then suspended my account? Then fixed it? What is going on, guys? Infuriating that the Reels button, that nobody asked for, is where the New Post button should be, and the notifications button was replaced by shopping. Who trusts anything sold on Instagram?! Put the buttons back, FFS",1
Account was hacked. The get support feature does not work. It crashes every time I try to use it. Cannot get in touch with anyone to resolve the issue. Extremely poor customer service.,1
I miss so many posts due to constand random refreshing and things just not showing up. Having to go through old posts just to see thing that we should be on the main page. More ads than a catalog.,1
Unable to use my account from last 2-3 days it's not working.. is this what ur service is like?? Unable to send or receive msg n also not able to do any changes in my account.. its only buffering from so many days. Look into the matter and resolve this issue as soon as possible.,1
"My account is marked for deletion for no reason??? I havent posted on it but it was still being actively used so I can like posts and watch videos on the platform and all of a sudden I wake up to find I cant look at any stories, I cant like any posts, and I cant even view my account?? And now its stating someone changed my password when nothing has been changed? The when I attempt to create a new one with the same username Im told I cant because its already in use??? Can someone please fix this?",1
"every time I open the app it shows a black screen, I can't use it! I already tried uninstalling and reinstalling, updating my software, clearing cache and data, restarting my phone and etc, absolutely NOTHING works! PLEASE fix this soon, I can't take it anymore, I love Instagram but this way I'll have to stop using it.",1
why is your name Instagram. Change the name to bugstagram. If can't handle app stop running it. It will be more useful. I can't see message what people sent. It takes me a day or more to receive messages. I can't add people to my group. Everytime I try to add it just gets stuck with everything blank. To add one person I have to close and open insta 10 times . And guess what we can't remove them . This option is useless now. I can't remove people from my own group.,1
"It stops working whenever it wants. I have literally reported 100 times but it doesn't fix it this app has alot of bugs, glitches. This app is full of technical problems.",1
"I got hacked and Instagram was not helpful at all in helping me get back into my old account so I had to make a new one. And no matter how many people reported the account Instagram wouldn't take it down, so if you're looking for a safe app, this isn't it. Otherwise it's not bad for posting pics",1
"I used to enjoy being on Instagram and connecting with my friends and some of my favourite creators. Now the posts I want to see are being hidden in favour of repetitive and irrelevant ads. I also seem to have lost the ability to make posts. I get to see 5 photos out of my gallery which are from several weeks ago and already uploaded. If I change the file to find my photos, I can only make an individual selection not multiple, which is neither use nor ornament. Hope it will be fixed soon",1
I am not able to see any results of Bollywood songs while applying music on my story. I am facing this issue since last 4 months. The song suggestions is only in English. Please look into my account so that I can see results of Bollywood songs also.,1
"See how terrible it was that , i sent a snap to my friend and the Instagram server has given me a community guidelines strike for child nudity. Don't you think how difficult it was to not send messages in Instagram for 3 consecutive days, in case the other people had reported that is reasonable to restrict. There is no problem with that photo to both of thus then why did you done",1
It's been 6 dys since I reported that my account has been hacked and I do not have access to my account so far instagram has taken no steps in helping to retrieve my account I had sent multiple mails in this regard as well. Right now I heard some of my friends account has been hacked as well. Utterly shocked and disgusted that a platform such as this is taking such serious matters so lightly. If you cannot ensure the security of the users you should cease to be working.,1
Just issues Locked out by the system for some reason. It won't refresh. It won't recognize the two factor authentication. Just buggy and bad.,1
"I used to like this app but I can't stand how IG is now putting posts in my feed of accounts I don't even follow, with no option to say ""not interested"". Some of the accounts are ones I purposely unfollowed in the past. If I wanted to follow those accounts I would. Also, the fact that I can't see what I'm typing when I comment on a post is terribly annoying. I have to keep dropping down my keyboard to see what I'm writing.",1
"I don't know why but these days this app is not working like as if I'm not connected to internet,,.just few seconds it refresh its contents to only about 3'4 posts other than that no new post shown ,...big thing the message section is not working at all ......pls make an update to solve this problem...,",1
Well it was fine until my account was hacked and I was unable to recover it or even change the password. Sooooooo no assistance on Instagram's part and now ALL of my contacts are being spammed. Awesome. Grrrrrrrr.,1
The app experience has degraded sm... especially today.. my dms aren't loading at all and it is very irritating. I can't send any messages or reply to any of them... would really appreciate if this is fixed asap,1
"After yrs of having this app I've decided to uninstall... hate having the suggestions on my home feed to the point it's literally a suggestion every other post, if I wanted them I would follow them, look at any other account and my feed is then jammed full of suggestion the same, it's not what I signed up for... enough is enough..",1
My Instagram account is facing an issue. my Instagram app stops anytime. Doesn't crash but doesn't work either. Nothing get refresh. Message stops being sent.,1
"I don't know what has happened with my Instagram account i am not able to recieve messages from people, neither refresh feature is working and my account section in the app keeps on loading no matter how much time i give there to open . It's all is really frustrating",1
"What's Wrong with the Recent Update.. Of this App, I can't even Put, See my own story, unable to see my own account...lagging a lot...Problm of scrolling... & lot more, never expected such issue from Instagram!!! Plzz Fix this Issue",1
"For the last month none of my highlights or archived stories will load, so I can't view them. Great job. Always tons of issues. Update did not fix anything stellar job guys",1
This aap get bad experience to user beacuse when I open this app it shows network issue and my all other app works very fast but my Instagram not working.i reinstall and install this aap many time but it gets unless changed.. dear Instagram team please solve my Instagram issue..,1
Hate that Story drafts expire after 7 days and permanently are deleted with no way of recovery. Also saving them to your phone is 1 by 1 instead of having a easier way.,1
"Nothing is working for me, I can't send message nor load anything properly. The help app doesn't work for me. I've signed out and back in, and reinstalled the app and nothing is working properly",1
"So I created an account, and days later after following some friends and liking their content, they restricted it because I did something against their policy (no details)? I reported it on Instagram and Twitter to no avail. Even past the restriction date my account is still locked. Horrible wanna-be tiktok app and nonexistent support.",1
Lately my app doesn't refresh and the screen goes blank. Tried logging out and in and reinstalled the app as well. Still same problem.,1
"Dear sir, I am Mir, sir on Instagram there is a feature i.e. ""Reply to the message"". It's too many times to go but I don't get the features. Can you please solve the bugs, I am facing too many problems. Thank you",1
Few things are going wrong after updates . Insta is going worst after day by day . I always see who i follow recently . But after the updates this feature is not working . So that is big bug on insta . Resolve this problem,1
Photo in a post suddenly got cropped off or zoomed in after the latest update. It's appearing fine on desktop and Instagram Lite.,1
"I am a 25 years old man, and my account was banner, because instagram assumed I was under 13 years old (in most my picture I have a beard). I was to provide an ID of some sort, which I did provide, but it was rejected. I tried to contact instagram, however it turned out futile, because they do not have a support team. Horrible user experience.",1
All of my photo drafts disappeared twice and now there's no way to bring them back. You make it just worse with new updates and when there's a problem we can't get it solved cause your customer support is nonexistent.,1
"Posting a video is hopeless! Junk! Piss on your Reels! The app is jacked up! When you open it, and try to post the first photo in your camera roll, it just shows grey!",1
The experience is going down. The chat quality is very poor. The message receiving speed and notifications are coming only after 10-15 minutes laterüò§üò§üò§,1
Where's all my archived post. Now Only have tons of archive stories on the calendar that I don't want to see. I want my post. And also I haved archived stories in my profile.all stories hidden is all rubbish I don't want....!!!!!!! Give me back my archived post pleaseeeeeee. I don't like the new updated Instagram,1
Idk what's happening with this app...I am nott able to dm anyone nor I'm getting any messages from anyone...all dm's are disable. also I'm not able to see any of my message request...and I can't see ig notes which people put there. Pls do something,1
I would draw the attention of instagram to the fact that the I am getting notifications very late ....and sometimes it lags also...I want that the chatting facility will be looked into and fix the bugs as soon as possible,1
Facing many problems in using the app. It's not updating any thing. Only it's buffering whenever I open the app.,1
"As I have a religious page @believer._of_shiva. Whenever I want to post something, I can't find suitable song for it. Not even Bollywood or pollywood songs. Please try to solve this problem as soon as possible. It affect my account.",1
Worth less .. as it was before at the time There is all you can see just bugs . Tho after a good connection the also it's refresh rate is not coendable .... Hope this review could work out to ... @instagram #instagramhelpcenter,1
"""x who you may know is on instagram"", tired of getting these notifications. I have the setting turned off and im still getting them. Been like this for months.",1
"*Update: Horrific user experience in the posting process. App keeps crashing constantly when trying to do anything more than looking at photos. So creating posts, stories or any kind of content is hard to impossible... Also when trying to post it will not see your photo gallery & only let you choose from a few very old photos of yours until you reinstall the app - this is a horrible app to use, easily one of the worst out there. BAD, AWFULL job Meta!!",1
It's been so long I am using insta and I love this app for its security and many other features ü§≠‚ù§Ô∏è but recently my id got hacked and i am doing face verification also then also i am not getting it back and someone else is having access to it which can cause me in trouble i mailed insta so many tym but no respond i am in huge prblm help me plz ......üôèüôèüôèüôèüòëüòëüòëüòëüòëüòë,1
"Cannot read messages. Everytime open message notification, the chat box is not loading. It only showing 2,3 years back chat history only. Very disappointed with the chatting feature provided.",1
"Not sure what has happened to Instagram lately, but it's failing with its reels and supporting with enquiries. I have been unable to use music with posts and reels for weeks, and now my reels upload upside down, yet no one has bothered to reply to my messages. Unfortunately, a massive let down for what used to be a great platform.",1
Had to switch phones. I have 2FA on my account via text but now don't have that option. Forced to use an authentication app that isn't linked to my account's 2FA and am effectively locked out of my account with no customer service options available to me other than this.,1
"Hello I have changed my FB account email and I can't sign in or sign up by any means. I tried to log in from my other FB account but the app asks me to try again later. I tried to log in from the browser, but the same message of trying later appeared. I tried to sign up with completely new email, but nothing new happened. I checked my phone settings and my Google account settings but again I receive the same answer of trying again. I don't know what's happening.",1
"Glitches. I cannot remove a highlight from my reels ~ no matter how many time I delete it, it shows right back up. Also deleting a single photo from a lineup no longer works.",1
"The first two times I installed the app, the photos and reels did not load. It only worked the third time. The feed is filled with suggested or related posts which I do not want to see! There seems to be no options to completely disable all suggested posts. So I have to click them one by one and choose ""not interested"".",1
"Lately, my Instagram has been blocking me from liking any of my followers' posts. It states from the Community Guidelines that sharing my account to get more likes or comments is against policy. The block will expire every 7 days, and then I'm back where I started. I am not impressed anymore with Instagram. I've asked the Help Center for actual ""help"" and, again, no help. I am very disappointed in Instagram.",1
"I'm very disappointed with work of Instagram it's troubling a lot plz clear all the issues which I'm facing I'm unable to make reels it's just loading,still facing the problem I'm unable to upload my videos when I'm uploading it's showing discard post im losing my all reel videos i hate uh Instagram really disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è",1
"Got a new phone (Pixel 7 Pro) and can no longer log into multiple accounts. Every time I try, I get ""Error: Sorry, we couldn't complete your request. Please try again in a moment."" It's been a very long moment since I've tried multiple accounts over multiple days.",1
I don't get it why is it so famous its just full of glitches and bugs its really annoying and we can't even use the songs we want on top of that new bugs keep poping up they're not even fixing the bugs!!!,1
"This app is decent, but there have been a couple bugs. It doesn't let me like a some post even though it just a regular one. And the app doesn't let me follow some friends, supposedly for safety purpose however the accounts and post aren't even out of place.",1
"Not so expected results in the experience. Very poor performance. Recieving chat notifications after so much time from the time they are sent. Connectivity issue is very frequent. Stories disappear even after saving it to archive. Very underrated performance. Needs so much to get better. Expecting it to give it's best performance. Mainly Instagram can focus on enhancing the notification timing problem. Need it to be improved, to gain positive reviews. Giving a one star for now.",1
Making a post with multiple photos is very buggy. I cannot edit each one properly and sometimes they get shifted or rotated when saving drafts. Very difficult to use and buggy.,1
Cannot see any of my messages even tho I know their there can't get it to load at all constantly having problems with reels and deleting drafts. Doesn't update how many people following me and me following takes days for the number to update. Constantly closes out saying app not working. And occasionally have feed and discover loading problems. This app use to be so great and now it seems like they gave up and just letting it turn to trash.,1
From past 1 year approx I'm using old version of Instagram... although I update throughout..only my account is having this problem..if I open some other account in my phone it has all the updates but my account doesn't...I have reported many times but no help received...if u can see this insta please help...I need to fix this..,1
"It's changed alot and I am now having problems with it, alot of problems. I have a big problem with fake accounts and nothing seems to be done about it. It was a great app but since last update my music on my reels don't work properly and everything isbout of sinc they are promoting reels. Not impressed. Now my reach as just about gone and finding it so hard at the moment on this platform, which I used to enjoy so much",1
"This app isn't letting me change my password and keeps saying wait for a few minutes , worst experience ever , tons of bugs and glitches that isn't allowing us to log in again , I tried uninstalling and installing the apps for many times",1
"I have deleted insta but at that time it is ok but after i downloaded it again it have new and good features but I cannot watch reels when I start them after 6,7 reel they stops when I reload it cannot start it tels something went wrong",1
Borderline unusable. Every FOURTH post is an ad. Timeline no longer chronological. You scroll down a few posts and start just seeing spam instead of your friends. It's owned by Facebook so the privacy trade-off doesn't come close to justified by such a poor experience.,1
Messenger app does not work properly i am not able to use like the way we use watsapp. It used to work properly previously but suddenly all features have stopped,1
"Its been more than a year. I didn't got the messenger updation. I can't neither reply to a message nor react to them. Also there is no collab option, notes, nothing. I reported several times about these issues still u guys are not bothering to look after. Please check out the problems üôè",1

This app is one of the worst social media apps they have available. Terrible management anything Facebook/meta buys turns into complete garbage. I do not recommend this app. This app is bad no good complete garbage. I can't unfollow anyone and now that I've tried a few times I'm restricted on what I can even do on the app like save or like anything. Terrible management terrible app. Nothing but restrictions ever since I started using the app. Very bad app. How can a app become so bad so fast?,1
"Impossible to post pictures without them shifting to the right with a black strip appearing on the left. I can adjust one, and another changes back.",1
"I forget my password and it's refusing to get me to reset it , although I tried so many times but the notification to my email doesn't appear nor in my messages, like what can I do bro , there's literally nothing to do , I tried so hard and it's just stupid how it can't even send me an email or a text to reset my password.",1
"Would be nice to have some control, at all, over who can DM you. Also it would be nice if extremely basic features like sharing stories were functional.",1
Dear Instagram Team Recently in any Instagram accoruant I gam umable to send messages to anyone. whenever I am going to send messages it's showing me that i commot send messages for 3 days but I have not done anything. wrong and im sure I have followed your Jules of conduct and i kindly request So to please back any account as soon as Possible. My Instagram I'd x_babu_jodhpur_007 My Instagram problem,1
When i post a reel the app automatically crashed. I can't understand what's going on. I think older instagram was better than the new,1
After update I cannot view old chats and cannot message anyone but everything else seems to work fine. I tested it both on mobile data and wifi still not working,1
Hello Instagram team; I m unable to add caption on my reels I don't know why but i tried to upload several reels and i am unable to add caption on it Kindly have a look to this and solve the problem ASAP THANK YOU‚ù§Ô∏è,1
It keeps crashing even after update. Whenever I am opening my profile it is crashing again and again.,1
"The explore tab is so horrible! Now it's full of random posts that's completely irrelevant from what I follow. I've got posts written in Spanish and Russian eventhough I don't speak those languages. Now my explore tab is full of Harry Styles. I don't even listen to his songs?! Fix your goddamn explore tab, IG.",1
Way too many suggested follows. Way too many ads. I know this is an ad filled marketing app. It's Way too much in terms frequencies,1
"Hye.. I wanna do a report because my Instagram archive story was missing on November 26, 2022. The missing video was really important to me. I really don't know what to do. Please I hope you can fix this problems asap. Thankyou:)",1
Annoyed!!!!!!! I'm sick and tired of trying to share something and the app crashes. I've been uninstalling and reinstalling this app countless times. Damn!!!!!,1
Why this app auto refresh every time when we unlock mobile even after 1 minute...why can't we see post from where we left it. if we want then we will refresh from our side...it's frustrating experience with auto refresh of this app... We need to search a lot after auto refresh... So stop this auto refresh of ur application,1
They're controlled by main stream media for suuuuure. Lost half my follower count because they like to mess with analytics like a fat kid eats cake. If you want to post content that has absolutely no meaning this is a good app. If you want to use it as an actual social media platform you'd have better luck making your own app.,1
"Having trouble posting and taking pictures using filters in posts and stories. The audios I've saved don't appear in the 'saved' section when I make reels. When I save a new one, it appears but the old ones disappear. Instagram is getting worse. It just crashes all of a sudden and doesn't load my feed and suddenly exits me out of the app.",1
From past 10days i am not able to use anything from instagram as it shows glitches. Not able to see anyone's story and reels even i am not able to like someone's post. Earlier it was pretty smooth but now it is just pathetic.,1
I'm rating one star is because I can't send message to anyone it shows as if I have a network problem but in the other apps it works well... I'm really disappointed with this. please fix it as soon as problem,1
"Everything was alright but when I open my liked videos, after watch 2 reels it's automatically coming back to home screen. Again from the first I need to open it. Plz try to fix this problem",1
"Crashes like every single time I use it. I cant post pictures on my stories. The company is soo inconsistent that features such as: editing reels, making videos, video calls, the list goes on, either were downgraded or not existing at the moment (mind you im talking about months time) creator clearly doesn't check up on the app as of right now I can't even open the app. Theres no use to updating the app cus there's no hot fixes, no bug fixes, no patches, no nothing.",1
One main reason i give Instagram a single star is because there has been a bug lately and it affected my account and the notes completely disappeared on my specific main account and even after redownloading it multiple times it still doesn't work.I even complained it thrice and it's already been 5 days now and i still haven't heard from Instagram helpline.,1
"How does an app that is literally all about pictures fail so constantly and consistently to... post the selected pictures? Between pictures not loading, and only realising after posting that it has actually decided to post different pictures from the ones I selected (which is insane, and sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen), this app is just horrendous. Maybe get the basics right before shoving more and more advertising down our throats.",1
"The new way to look through comments on reels is horrible. Either see the video, or see 1/4 of the video and comments. Not more shrinking the video to see both the video and comments. Which dumbass thought of that idea? I also can't see any replies. Not even the option to see replies. I have never change any setting to be like this.",1
The photos become distorted after edit and post. My old post was cropped. PLEASE FIX IT!!!,1
The app is good but it have so many glitches and I can't upload my video in high quality it always decresses video quality and sometimes even laggy I can't upload my videos because of this problem so please fix it as soon as possible and don't ignore it as always,1
I have been reporting to the team through the help section in the app that I haven't yet received the notes feature for the past two months and there has been no response. I have tried reinstalling the app and that didn't work. Please look into it.,1
the older posts category on the feed is obsolete and the space dedicated to similar posts should be used in explore. the algorithm in the explore could be better. reels are bad enough but forcing every normal video into a semi-reels video player unless it's part of a slide is very user-unfriedly. the menu with the shop instead of activity and reels instead of post has always been counterintuitive. there's a lot wrong with the app.,1
"We should pin some of the direct messages in Instagram, just like WhatsApp. There are some important messages, I want them to be the first of the messages above!",1
"I have been using Instagram for some years now it's a great app but from few days it's not working. Nothing appers on the screen. It's blank. and shows error, couldn't refresh. I had to make another account because of that. And the another account is also facing issues more than half of the songs do not work on reels. And the reels are not even scrolling. Please take of this as soon as possible .I hope that this gets fixed very soon.",1
"Too much bug in this app the notes section is not showing about 2 week , the 60 story is not working in this app but the pop message show (you can keep 60 second story ) but is not working at all kindly fix the bugs this app",1
"Just want that closed friends posting stuff to be back With reels, your speed still is nothing for pre record videos from device. Too much focus on filters only with bare minimuk options for editing reels",1
"Horrible now. Bugs seem to never get fixed, the reels option is ridiculous and lags, keep seeing so many ads on my feed and content I don't even like.",1
"Want to boost a reel but, it says something went wrong try again later but it's the same thing all over again, and contacting support is pointless cuz apparently no one replies",1
"My original Instagram got hacked, and you would think there would be help I could get to restore my account. There's no one to call, no one to contact, emails are unresponsive, phone calls have no option to speak with someone.",1
"Very bad experience since some day. Manu glitch, bugs. All notifications automatically delete ? Message not show properly. Followers, following check latest, earlier option not working properly. Plz solf this problems. Thank you",1
"What is going on with Instagram!! This app for a while now has been terrible. I can't see my feed after vewng a few posts as it won't load. I never seem to see any posts that I have missed from a previous day, but I will see repeat of new posts, probably due to the popularity. When I click to view old posts, this doesn't work, again I have a similar issue viewing repeat posts. I'm not sure what you are trying to do to this app, but go back to basics, just have a time feed and no algorithms",1
"I keep downloading the app, and all I get is a blank screen. I have tried everything including reinstalling, restarting the phone, clearing cache etc. It's weird that an app like Instagram which is used by millions of people around the globe has such a bad tech team. If updates that users clearly hate are being pushed, at least make sure that it doesn't affect basic activities users do with the app and the issues don't pan out for days and weeks.",1
I just installed the app right now after uninstalling it for some days... The app keeps stopping anytime I try to open it... Please fix the issue so i can run the app :(,1

"Dissapointed. My invite collaborator option is not coming to my account despite of all tries i has made, despite of several times i have reported this to the insta team. Didnt expect this frm a app which comes from a big organisation. Pathetic",1
"No customer support? I keep getting blocked from commenting, liking, etc. & I cannot write captions on posts, for no reason & always very suddenly. I literally made 1 comment, and I was blocked & this keeps happening over and over non-stop. I'm an Influencer/Content Creator & I keep losing jobs & money bc I'm not able to post my content. :( These blocks make no sense and are out of nowhere. What is wrong here? I really need to talk to someone, so I can know what's going on with my account :'(",1
"My phone/instagram account is always late on getting features update, i can't even use the ""add yours"" sticker. It used to be usable on my device but now, after some updates, i can't use it for whatever reason that is, i keep updating but i still can't use it until now.",1

"App has been solely developed for aPpLe users, They cannot upload my pics and videos with decent quality even though my S22 ultra has undoubtedly the best camera and recording processor in any phone. I have researched and played with multiple settings with both the app and my phone to make this work. They follow suit right behind Snapchat with the neglect lion of the android community",1
"Recently tried to create a reel using a pre-recorded video, preview looks fine until I upload it, the video freezes when you play it back. I tried 5 times, differing my options each time, no luck. I followed advise to update my app and now I'm unable to log into Instagram at all. Blank white screen appears when you open the app and log in page never loads. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, clearing cache, fiddling with permissions, restarting my phone, updating my phone etc. Please help",1
"Worst app till the date!! It is not an app.. it is garbage!! It is full of glitches and bugs! How you guys can be so irresponsible! This is such a big platform but still it is full of bugs and glitches? Why? Shame on you guys! Shame on you! Especially your engineers! They're like a statue! Just sitting on the chair and doing nothing! Improve your team, Instagram!",1
"Way too many updates. Almost seems weekly at this point Another week, another update. This makes 4 week in a row for updates. Also the photo editing software is super buggy after the last update.",1
I always sort my following list by latest but it just refresh the page nd shows me the default following list. Also I'm unable to see the reels option on the home page. Plz fix these bugs.,1

"Slow and clunky, latest update throttles 16:9 videos. More bugs than under a rock. UPDATED: I hate this app. If I didn't use it for work I would never use it. Pure trash.",1
Instagram has no means of helping users if their account is shut down with not explanation and no flags or reports. I now lost the most convenient username for my business and also am afraid to create another one because I never got feedback as to why mine doesn't work anymore. Everytime I sign in to this particular account it's just a blank page and all of my post are gone when I try to view my account from other account users.,1
Worst app don't even use it. I stopped posting on Instagram for almost 6-7 months moved to other platforms but for some reason I always get a warning saying I'm posting false or misleading information and restrictions will apply for 90 days. Plz explain why I'm getting flagged whe I don't even use the app anymore. 1 star is too much this app deserves 0 stars,1
"It's actually impressive how bad this app is. Since the birth of tablets, most apps have been given the ability to work in landscape mode. But not Instagram. Nope. We wanna give the worst experience possible...Just trash.... wish I could do less than 1 star. It's no wonder why more people are choosing to not use Instagram. Good luck in your future suck...",1

"Instagram has gone downhill. My account got hacked, bank was comprised as i run ads for business. Hacker started using my account to scam my followers. Sadly, Instagram's solutions on help centre didn't help at all. Selfie verification failed too. No where to contact them or file a case for hacked account. Truly disappointing.",1
"Why didn't I see the new update?! I updated it many times, and it did not appear for me to update (notes). I also deleted the application and re-downloaded it, but it is the same result üò¢üò¢",1
My Instagram app is not working and responding even though I uninstalled it and installed it again using wifi though there is no use of it . Can you please check this out what's wrong !!,1

It's alright for following artists and messaging people (sometimes). But I legit made a comment about wanting $10 a day and my account got threatened and the app stopped working. Do better Instagram. Grown adults crying over poor strangers talking about money. Also all the updates aside from liking stories have been taken away. This app is run by man babies.,1
"Not able to refresh my feed from many days. Tried unsistalling and reinstalling, even deleted cache but nothing works still it shoes only 2 or 3 reel which is previously loaded not even loading the messages",1

"When uploading photos, the app now cuts the edges off or puts them at an odd angle. Really annoying & has made me use it less.",1
"Used to be two stars now it's only one because that's the number of posts you can make it through before a blatantly scam ad shows up every other post ""get your free diamond ring just pay shipping"" with about 6 comments of people being like wow charged me $200 and never got anything from them. Adstagram just change your name to adstagram ffs. Update- just got reported because I commented ""once had an old homeless lady if I was the antichrist"" so there's that apparently can't share stories??",1

"It was fun. Until they deactivated my account with zero warnings, notifications, nor reasoning behind it. Help is non existent. Just gone, all gone.",1
"I didn't receive the security code to log in to my account. I'm tired of trying to log in so many times, and instagram team not help at all. I have lost my account once. I have also lost my phone, do I have to lose my instagram account too? I'm tired of losing Instagram accounts again.",1

I Couldn't change the story highlight icon. Tried a hundred time but failed. Fix that quickly. And yes my Internet connection is good enough.,1
"I didn't mind the 16:9 ratio at first when I used the fold4, but know even the reels is not watchable, Black edges covering the reels making it impossible to watch!",1
My Instagram is glitching to much ! I can follow people because its constantly telling me to try again later as they are protecting community...... and so on . Fix this problem as soon as possible!,1
I reinstalled the app today and I was not able to react to messages and reels in my DM. I uninstalled it yesterday and it was working nicely but now I feel like I'm using a 2-3 year's older version of instagram,1
Can't make posts with pictures and videos anymore. Instagram keeps forcing you to make reels like this is TikTok. What a terrible way to alienate your users by forcing them to use it like another competing app.,1
When I press on the reel sent in messages it's not opening. Rather the reaction tab is opening. Please do something about it. It's too annoying.,1
"Instagram always sho some glich in my phone, somtimes stuck and glitch in chat. When i am watching reel for 30 min continues, in some it suddenly glich and i go back then i will restart the app. My phone is honor play",1
I can't modify my old stories in my story archive and story highlights! The app keeps on crashing everytime when I try to open them!,1
"The fact that this app is owned by a billionaire yet runs worse than an app made by a small dev team is embarrasing. My messages don't work on this app anymore. I rarely get notifications for messages, both in and out of the app, or i get a notification but the message doesn't load. DO BETTER, INSTAGRAM.",1
"Worst too much lags, glitch, I can't reply to msgs, can't able to add music to stories, reels and soo many other issues.",1
Awful when trying to post multiple images to the main feed. Crops and rotations made to images dont get saved properly leaving black bands around images,1
"Facing an issue 1. Cannot login and logout 2. Couldn't refresh load 3. Cannot access dms This is since Last week, haven't received any support!!!",1
When I'm trying to post something in my story it wasn't letting me post it keeps glitching y'all need to upgrade your app when I try to make a new account literally close it which was weird please fix this app,1
it doesnt let you log into your other account through Facebook. whats the point of having the app be connected if there's no option to LOG INTO IT?. 0/100 won't recommend,1
"Please, on Instagram, there are lots of sales under the guise of being cheap, even though they are frauds. I want a solution so that Instagram immediately creates a tight security system so that these accounts can be closed immediately rather than harming the community.",1
"My Instagram is not working.theme option is not showing, messanger icon is not showing, i cant reply to messages fix it fast. ü§Øüò¨ Can anyone help me to work it properly",1
Unable to react on messages in chat. Only like option appears. Long time bug not getting solved even after reporting.,1

"Again, there are no reels in the app. Every time I reinstall. And I couldn't log in through Facebook. AGAIN. Before this reels, now the note and reacting on msg is not working. What's going on with ig?",1
"Instagram does nothing to stop hate speech and harassment. It doesn't matter if you report it, they do nothing about it. My husband has over 100 messages with nothing but people telling him to kill himself and he reported every single one and Instagram has done nothing about it.",1
"Instagram has become a joke with security. My friend's account was hacked earlier in the year, and they did nothing to help them. Now another person close to me is being harassed by an individual who is using their likeness to spread racial slurs, nude photos, and other inappropriate things. There's no way to talk with anyone in the company about these situations, and no way to end the torment we're experiencing. And yes we tried reporting all accounts involved.",1
Very poor experience as a creator. The app keeps shutting down on its own. Idk why people love it so much. I've been on this app for well over 4 years and the current state of it has made me hate it. Would give it 0 stars if that were possible,1
App doesn't respect the privacy of its users. Some unknown person followed me and I never accepted their request. Out of the blue he messages me on my personal number. This is not right. And no customer service is available to talk directly on instagram to report your service.,1
"When I wanted to post a video as then due to some reason video didn't posted but ""video can't be posted"" Error line also showing the home page and it's too annoying and I'm unable to remove it, in fact i tried by log out my I'd and log in again but same things appears always..üòê",1
"I don't know if it is just a me problem, but tags keep disappearing in my posts despite saving them. It would only leave a few, but if I put more they would keep disappearing. Please fix this.",1
"Can only load a video every other day, constantly needs the cache emptied in order to work on my phone. Sorry to be negative, but how is a multi-billion dollar company like this not able to make such a popular app better? Yikes. I use it far less because it's so cumbersome.",1
"My ig account was going all well and then suddenly my whole profile was not displaying anything nor I can see other's profiles.I have uninstalled and logged in too many times and tried numerous methods and also reported Instagram team but there was no response. Also my swipe to reply option was not working from the very first , but they never responded after being reported so many times",1
It has been more buggy because it keeps telling me to wait while we set up english (United Kingdom) and then it says that you can continue in us english but when I click on it the feed doesn't refresh . And I can't live without insta,1
I've been using this app for quite a long time and honestly this app is getting worse day by day . Don't waste your time in waiting for getting better updates. After every updated it just gets worse. After the recent update I can't even post a single photo,1
"Wouldn't let me create an account, I've tried reinstalling the app multiple times and when I try to input my details it won't allow it even if it's my first time put the in the info, it'll tell me to try again later, or this action can not be requested or something",1
"The app doesn't function well In many ways... For example when I press ""keep watching"".... I should be able to keep watching the video.. Instead it starts all over again in full screen.... And when I open someone's profile using a link... When I open a post and try to go back... It just sends me to the home page and lose the profile I was looking at... Please fix ur app with simple a update",1
"It's broken. My feed has not updated in weeks. When I try viewing my old posts, it takes me back to November 5. I've tried repeatedly to send bug reports, but get no response.",1
Whenever I upload something after every 2nd - 4th post instagram freezes the uploading process and won't load anything in the future. Instagram acts then like I have no internet connection for almost week. This is happening for over a year now.,1

"User support is terrible, My account was recently suspended for no reason and Instagram itself is no help. I'd also like to point out a problem with the security code you must receive to verify your account when it gets suspended, I tried to get the code to no avail, I later got a code from my second account (which they also suspended for no reason) but it said I must wait 24 hours for a new code to verify on my main account, it's been 3 days and it still says to wait 24 hours.",1

"Stopped using... WARNING! Too many Scam advertisements allowed, do Not buy anything from any advertisements on Instagram. Needs sorting or could be the death of Insta as word spreads...",1
"There are far too many bugs acting up for no reason now. If it was fine before then, why is it starting problems now. Might just keep this uninstalled, I guess.",1

"This situation is unacceptable! I can not take it anymore and I'm here to set my boundaries, I've been betrayed several times but now I finally came to accept the reality of things. Everytime my friends would make an exceptionally funny joke only for me to not be able to laugh react, continuously reminded of the injustice, I end up sending a sperate awkward laughing emoji, sitting right there at the bottom of the conversation.

And like I send a video selfie thrice and it all got denied tho there's so many pictures of my in my account. Please make the system better my account is bring hacked and I can't even do anything to get it back.",1
Stop trying to be like tiktok üíÅ the entire app is now algorithm based and most of the stuff you see are either suggested post or advertisement from people you don't follow. The app is also buggy as heck when it come to video or photo uploading.,1
I would give 0 stars if I could. Do not get this app if your account gets hacked they won't do anything to help. There help center isn't useful at all well and you can't even call there number because no one will answer. I just lost my account cause I wasn't even informed someone had even logged into my account.,1
"Many bugs are appearing, so problematic to deal with, and list of follower and following doesn't displaying properly too many bugs!! When will Instagram authority resolve this issues?? Just giving new updates only, but issue is still unresolved !",1
Direct message notifications have had issues for months now. Half the time I don't receive any notification for a message and have to physically go into the app and refresh for it to register a message.,1
"Now when I frame up pictures just before I post. Everything is well centred until I post, and edges of the photo are truncated. How about a preview that's actually accurate, wouldn't that be handy! Now IG you're impacting the quality of my posts, so frustrating",1
"Instagram is good for marketing and has become more commercial. I get lot of genuine followers still follower number won't change. Even if it increases at that time, it goes back to same. I have requested Instagram for authentication as I am a well known film freternity since 12years and worked on more than 10 mainstream projects. I have requested with all required documents and new articles, still Instagram doesn't respond. And many third party are selling follower and authentication.",1
"I'm experiencing a terrible bug where Im trying to post reels and in the previews, the audio is fine but once its posted there's no sound at all??? There's nothing wrong with the audio source, I've checked. Also noticed the quality of font looks horrendous when posting on stories especially when you use any color besides black. Looks like someone took a screenshot of some text and posted a lower-quality jpg of it. The quality was fine before, what happened??? Pls fix",1
"You can only view people's posts once and then the next time you open the app, they've disappeared and it's just endless reels. Really annoying and boring. Why can't they change it back and get rid of the reels in the main feed?",1
This app has seriously become the worst app to use for your videos. While using my iPhone it loads the video dark on one account and too bright on another account the exact same video and same device. Then to top it off I tried to log out of one account on iPhone and it makes you do all. On my Android I can log out of one account no problem. Seriously just use anything else unless you want to waste your time and your effort. Just keeps getting worse and worse....,1
I @its.quinnverse has logged out of my account once and I tried to log in the other day and suddenly I'm not able to I can't even recover it as I don't have access to my backup gmail anymore and i even tried testing with the face recognise one option but as i like to be anonymous i don't have a photo of me! I tried asking my friends for help to recover my account but they didn't receive any notification they said.im not able to make a new account too!look into the matter pretty please!!!!!,1
"It sucks, no customization to feed, keeps changing the feed to things i dont care about, keeps taking away vids i was watching, i just look at one thing and keep getting the same dumb topic, just have vids from tictok, reels are a total pain because the creators have to do reels in order to get more veiws. To many scammers bots and ads. Its not fun, nothing really interesting to watch and now subscribers have to be a things. More ways to steal money, not worth it.",1
Idk why but the few months the app has gotten worse with glitches. It's nearly impossible to post on my feed. Videos keep getting stretched weirdly when I tap them to watch. It will just shut down and kick me off the app entirely. Idk if I need to uninstall or what but it just makes the app really hard to use.,1
Trying to recover a hacked account is so difficult. The selfie recover method just freezes on the loading screen and then nothing else. As of writing this post it's been 10 minutes and still no change. Update: Can now use selfie method but keep saying they can't confirm my identity from the video selfie. How hard is it to confirm? Maybe get people to confirm it instead of an algorithm would make recovering ones account easier from hackers.,1
The app suddenly crashed. It's just stuck on a white screen. I pretty much did everything I could to have it fixed. I closed the app from running in the background and reopen but same. I did reinstall the app couple of times. Restarted my phone. Clear cache and data of the app then I uninstall it again. But after reinstalling it's still the same. What's wrong with app? This happened last night and it's still an ongoing issue. Pls have it fixed!,1
"Honestly, why do I even bother using this if it's barely functional? Can't watch reels, feed algorithm is broken, flickers between dark and light theme making text unreadable and the ""discover"" function is full of content I ignored...",1
"the ""seen"" feature is ridiculous, I always accidentally open instagram causing it to come up ""seen"" even if the messages didnt load yet. why is there a way to to turn it off or at least make it only do it if it is loaded and its been more than 5 seconds or something? just causes arguments.",1
"It was nice in the beginning but now, it's not showing the cross messaging option in my insta account chat window. And no themes are available, even reply option is also not working. I have reported this many times. But no one responded till now. I'm not satisfied with it. I'm very disappointedüëéüëéüëé",1
"I recently switched phones and tried to login to Instagram, they ask for a verification so they send me an SMS code, then it asks me to verify again via Email or SMS which then takes me back to verify SMS, and then I receive no more codes. Instagram tech is awful and so is the support, you'd think a billion dollar company wouldn't have such buggy terrible programming but here we are.",1
"Disappointed‚ÄºÔ∏è Have been facing a bug since ages and have reported the same many times in the app, yet not resolved. I'm not able to react to msgs or mention a msg in a chat from my account. Can do the same from other accounts in the same phone. Have reported this issue many times but it isn't resolved yet. Really upset. No response to this too.ü§•",1
Ruined by corporate greed. For years I used this app to interact with friends and post photos for others to see and interact with. Yet in the past 6 months it's been snowballing into a disaster of an attempt to cash in on advertising using its existing user base as livestock. I just opened the app and the first 6/10 posts I saw were either suggested or sponsored posts. I understand that instagram needs advertising to exist but this militant barrage of ads is driving me and other users away.,1
so my instagram app got uninstalled and i forgot the password to my account so i am unable to log in. However as soon as i am entering my linked phone number the link they are sending to get into the account is not working at all. I have my all progress as a creator saved on that account.,1
"All the hard work on my page @sneaky_offers was taken down without any notice/warning and reason. It was a very normal page & nothing suspicious over there but since it's their platform, they'll do whatever they want. and you'll find no way to contact their support team.",1
More app problems that will never get fixed. One of the many is I cannot apply a tag on any of my photos lol. One of the best features on Instagram is rendered useless by bad coding and lack of any sort of upkeep. Actively makes me post less and use the app less,1
"Instagram used to have interesting feeds, but now every post on my feed is either an ad, suggested post, or a reel. Instagram will literally hide posts by my friends for days before showing them in my feed. You just cant use this app to keep up with your friends anymore, which is the whole point. Meta runs everything into the ground, and Zuckerberg wonders why people use his apps less than they used to.",1
"Lately it seems to get more and more bugs. I constantly get flagged by the app as spam (especially annoying, it takes a few weeks every time for things to get back to normal, and this normal lasts about a couple of hours or days), notifications arrive late, the reels I would be watching refresh themselves out of nowhere and the feed is flooded with stuff I don't enjoy. Fix your bugs please, I am sick of that ""we restrict certain activities for the safety of our community"".",1
"Lost access to my account for no reason. I emailed and tried to reach out but heard nothing back. Its been devestating as an artist to go through and its very unfair the way they take platforms away from artists, for no reason.",1
"Instagram is never working. Nor solving it's problems. Glitches are unending and my main account is full of problems now! I can't send messages, can't post, can't check my own profile, cannot see who reacted on my story. It is worthless. Second works okayish but with glitches. I've reported multiple times now. Do something or people will seriously deactivate and get done!",1
"Everyone have the feature of ""Update Messaging"" except me !! did everything I should do, I have the latest updates of Instagram and Messenger also my accounts are synced, I reported so many times and till now It's not available I can't react with emojis to my friends messages I can't reply on each message too, I'm not living in Europe regions so it is available in my country and my friends use it, so pls fix it.",1
"I use this app a lot n connect with frds, yet as many times you update it I went worst. Now I have to watch ads on my home page where I supposed to see my friends post, and cannot unsave the saved post as the app auto off itself.",1
"The most recent change has to be the most idiotic and irritating of them all. It's absolutely impossible to go back when looking at stories. Went through too fast? Want to look at it again? Too bad, you can't go back now! It also seems to skip through stories at times. It's incredibly frustrating. I'll simply be switching to a different platform if this remains",1
Very bad experience I've ever had.Too worst suddenly it stopped working even mobile data is on but it was showing couldn't refresh feed repeatedly too worst. What's the problem I don't know this is my 2nd experience...,1
I was supposed to give -1 star but there is no option for that. They are disabling account without any reason and i raised complaint also but they are not even responding for that. Instagram is getting worst day by day. Very very very very very worst app i have ever used. So disappointed üòû. I hope it will be fixed as soon as possible.,1
"Replying Option Not Working. I couldn't this replying feature in chats. It has to work by swiping the message na, even when long pressing others messages i couldn't see the reply option. Neither swiping now long pressing the message is showing the reply option for me., Please help me out with this problem.",1
"Terrible, been having issues posting reels for over 2 weeks and nothing has been done about it! I use insta for my small business but since reels are what gets you seen, I'm pretty much invisible as this app keeps crashing ü§¨üñïüèºü§¨üñïüèº",1
"the feed is always suddenly change to strange things. content that I'm not even interested with is always pops up and annoys me. I've experienced this dozens of times since I first used Instagram and once again it's very, very annoying",1
Takes forever to load a link and I can no longer save photos from my messages. It says to give access to my storage folders which it has. Contacted developers and they haven't responded regarding the issue.,1
Extremely glitchy. Constantly forcing changes on you that make the interface difficult to use. Seemingly arbitrarily hides certain users and gives me almost no control over whose posts I see in my feed.,1
Can't upload a 60 second story. I have being try to upload without interruption but as usual my video is splitting in two or three parts. After many uninstall and installing process. I am frustrated because still i cant a upload a 30 or 60 second video story,1
Switching from accounts is incredibly glitchy and I think it's causing issues while rendering reels(I'm not switching while it's loading obviously) Update 12/23/2022: Edited pics with high resolution are turned into a sepia filter WITHOUT my input please fix,1
"Instagram's experience has gone down to the worst ever possible. Try to add an account, you'll get these ‚Äî ""Can't login with Facebook"" if you're trying to add another FB-linked account to Instagram. ""The username you entered doesn't appear to belong to an account"", when username is manually entered to login. Find an account? ""Please wait a few minutes before you try again"". Meaning ‚Äî Instagram doesn't allow you to add more than one account on a device. Not even worth for an app rated 4.3.",1
What happened? After the most recent update it seems to have deleted all of my message threads to where I can't go back and look up any groups that I was in like my family one or any of the ones that are connected to my friends. And that goes for both of my profiles that I use. Can someone fix this bug because it's starting to bug me,1
Instragram as been pretty good for me . But I can't even get on to the app. I've tryed send feedback. Close app .and I have turned phone off and back on again and gone to app to update and nothing still it's gone worse than ever .,1
Consistently frustrating issues with editing and uploading images and videos. Often closes out just as I'm finishing edits or refuses to save edits to prior images in series. Frustrated!,1
Very bad service Very low quality performance. It shows so many problems. Mayn others problem Please clarify all problems. I am faceing many problems Today there is no function occur please update app with proper work. Notification is not showing in phone bar .. please solve my problem Please solve my problem I am unable to get notification. Vedios are not playing. As soon as possible clear this,1
"Unreliable. When it works it's great, allowing me to engage with various communities. When it doesn't, the algorithm is overly controlling, it has glitches and deletes draft posts frequently. I often to have uninstall and reinstall it. If I could use something else to connect with the same people with images and text, I would.",1
Even less than one. I really don't know all of a sudden what happened.An hour ago I had a my account scrolling my feed suddenly after an hour when I opened my account it wasn't showing anything.I tried logging in through my mail or my phone but nothing worked I reinstalled it as per their instructions and my account was gone. I don't even use Instagram that much.. twice or thrice a day maybe.. I can't even remember when I posted something or commented on someone's post. I am really disappointed,1
"This app has sooo many glitches and bugs so hectic to use this app shows wrong number of dms recieved, glitches in account section and doesn't open the right reel when clicked on it. Very disappointing it doesn't even seems like it's part of such a big company.",1
"The glitches are becoming a headache and my account didn't update and it's been over 2 years I opened my account on this app no matter how many time I update or log out and log back in it's just the same, I don't know why that's happening but it's a problem please fix it.",1
"It's such an awful app to use. They just want to be different, it's not user-friendly at all. You can't pause a video!! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è you can't fast-forward a video!",1
I don't why but my app isn't working for the past three days. My account shows you have seen all the post from the past 3 days.. I an unable to see any new post rest everything is working fine.. stories are getting updated .... it's getting frustrating.... I have tried everything I could do ... pls do something in this matter...,1
When I play reels on feed and then scroll a little bit the reel gets frozen up and it's audio still plays. This is a major and old bug please fix it. Don't see this issue on iOS.,1
"Did latest update. Now the app won't open. And when I was viewing a video on Facebook it kept telling me that my Instagram wasn't working so asked if I wanted to close, report or app not working. So what is going on?! When will you fix it? (My phone is Moto G Pure) and as I was writing this the app not working screen popped up!",1
Last night I kept trying to video call and or audio call with my partner but it kept saying that it was unable to connect. I usually love this app but it made me mad that I wasn't able to video call or audio call my partner. I hope that the issue can get worked out soon.,1
"If there was an functioning alternative I would take it , if they didn't squish other apps that are similar. The guidelines/ rules are so random and inconsistent. Things can be removed not for the actual reasons listed by them, but rather because of the person biasness of the reviewer. This app is broken and has a clear preference for certain political correctness enforced by a rather fascist workforce.",1
When people send me messages I get notifications but when i click the message the text that people send aren't there. This is getting out of hand. At first it was just a little. Now i can't see anyones messages.,1
"The number of suggested and sponsored posts is crazy now. I basically have a pattern of 2 posts from an account I actually follow, followed by one sponsored post, then a suggested post. I could understand if I had gone through my current feed but the suggested is popping up before accounts I follow. I used to be able to snooze suggestions for 30 days, but that's now gone.",1
I hate the new update !!!! The feeds are not refreshing and I keep seeing the same posts all day long. For more than 2 days in a row. I like it before the new update. It was very diversed and it used to show me multiple pages that I follow + refreshes it self on its on everytime I opened it. I think I will deactivate my account and become a tiktok user üôÉ üôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉ,1
"The reels feature is useless most of the time. It crashes, freezes and lags like crazy. It's never been stable since they first launched it. Edit: I changed my rating from 2 stars to 1 because it has been over a year of Reels not being fixed in the slightest. What exactly are all of these updates for when nothing gets fixed? Another glitch is when I hold down on My Story icon, tap 'Add new story', then select my photo or video from the gallery, it takes me to the Post upload screen not Story.",1
Everything is fyn.. but one thing. Most of the effect and filters are not available for me and i am not able to use the some filters.. after updating only i am not able to use the filters Pls change that prob..,1
"This app has the worst recovery options that don't even work. Can't get back into my account after having to switch devices. Don't enable 2FA because the app is so dumb it doesn't realize that Instagram login codes should login you into the account, instead you get asked every single time for 2FA unable to access your account. What a terrible site.",1
"The app doesn't load. From last two days I am not able to access the app. Reels doesn't load, feeds don't refresh, settings doesn't load. Tried uninstalling and installing it again but no use. Frustrating",1
"Account blocked, no explanation why (I didn't post anything in 6 months). Unable to login, unable to contact anyone in Instagram. When trying to login just have a constant loader. No wonder fb stock fell 70% this year when they conduct their business like this.",1
"Instagram suspended my account without any kind of warning or email explaining why. I did not inflict any policy and not sure about the next steps on how to recover it, the information in their support center is not helpful. At this point not sure if someone hacked, if I will get it back or what is going to happen. I can not reach any instagram support email address... Terrible service and experience üòì",1
My reply option is not showing up even tho I've already updated to the lastest app version but It's still not working on. I've also report it so many times but still don't have a feedback. I hope they can fix it as soon as possible,1
"it keeps saying try again after a few mins whenever i try to make a second account,it has been hours since it happened and it's still not working :(((( instead of making the app a walmart version of tiktok,maybe focus on making the app better and more usable???? i rlly hope u will fix this problem :/",1
"DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN USE THIS APP! I do not follow ANY explicit accounts, yet everytime I open the app it is full nudity or ads for sex toys. This is becoming extremely annoying& disgusting. Do not open Instagram in public. Other than that, good app. I'm tired of seeing porn on a social media app and blocking/reporting every account only to get a response saying they aren't breaking the guidelines. So I'm giving 1 star",1
Starting to really hate the new update to Instagram. You can't pretty much do anything and they are turning into Facebook new way. I use to be able to add people aka find friends from phone number or Facebook and it seems that they got rid of that cause I cant find it no where.,1
Insta became so boring. If I like 1 reel see next 1000 reels of same type.. very bad algorithm.. I hardly see reels of one I follow when i scroll...missing tiktok :( it used to show all kind of videos.. instagram Content is also so bad these days..,1
"Cannot edit photos when making a multi photo post. Whenever I edit a new photo, it reverts the edit I made to the previous photo. Instead of trying to copy tiktok, perhaps please try to focus on what you used to do best with photos?",1
"When I give something in story, the story doesn't post and then when I discard the story, the image of that story remains on the screen like I can't do anything, I can't even remove that from the screen. When I restart my phone, then everything turns normal like nothing happened. Please Instagram I request you to solve this problem.",1
It is not working. My account is not getting updated to the latest version. I have reported many problems from my account to the instagram team. But they haven't responded or corrected it.specific messaging is not working.,1
"Only glitches!! not even have a support center there is nothing in support center which is related to any issue or problems and we can't contact them to support us. now we facing payment problems for our ads, UPI payment option is not available anymore in Instagram and card payment page is not working We report bug more than ten times it still not rectified, We using professional account for our business, and doing ads to promote our business",1
"this app sucks. - each of my accounts runs on a separate version of Instagram with different features - randomly the app will refuse to send me a notification for a strike against a post and then not let me see posts or post anything, completely softlocking my account until I reinstall and log back in - every time I've tried to report a pedophile it's just frozen on the report screen and not let me take it any further fix ur app. I only use it because it's where my friends and followers are",1
Save option has been removed from Instagram.... Please checked it out... We can't able to save videos nd reels.... So many bugs are there... It doesn't work smoothly.. Very poor features now a days,1
"I can't post half my pictures. It just says pictures can't be posted. But I've taken precautions and all photos are taken on the App itself. As well reels are now the only way to reach people. They are just trying to take over tiktok and other platforms. Insta is losing its way, this sucks.",1
"I uninstalled the app, and when I reinstalled it, the app won't open, just goes to a black screen, nothing on it at all When I go to playstore it says open, but nothing I've restarted my phone, I've uninstalled and reinstalled then restarted my phone. The app is the latest version,and my data signal has full bars, and I even cleared the cache. It's been days and still not working. What is wrong with it. Has anyone got a way to fix it?",1
"Too many bugs, I was happy at the beginning, this app it is stupidly frustrating to use, change the adjustments after you move or resize a image, always something, I'm very tired of this.",1
"They don't fix the constant problems, instead they just make it a trash app. This used to be a place to share photos with friends and family. Now it's a den of bugs, ads, stupid algorithms, and TikToks.",1
"Reels are ruining IG. So everyone can steal all your content now, this isn't a safe app at all. Deleted. Highly do NOT recommend. Everytime I open the app it skips over the accounts I choose to follow & bombards me with spam! My videos won't post, no explanation why. Notifications spamming me about irrelevant accounts! When I report spam it bombards me even more with the content I clearly do not want to see.",1
"Atrocious recommendation in the feed, like i enjoy different content but sometimes it's way too random and disturbing and I can't waste my time reporting every 3rd or 4th post. Edit: now this app is un usable, ad spam is unreal, I can't even enjoy reels anymore",1
"Recently started noticing when I try to upload photos onto My Story, they just appear black. If I've added text to the picture, the text will appear, but without the photo and on a black background which is completely useless and makes no sense to the viewer. Anyone else experiencing this bug? Needs to be corrected.",1
"Instagram created 2 accounts for me from my facebook account without my knowledge. I cannot find any information on how to merge or fix my account, why it created 2 accounts for me, and why only 1 account is following my friends, but not using facebook login. I have 1 friend from facebook on my 2nd account for some reason as well. Its actually crazy that basic account management is not possible.",1
"The app Is ok because it's popular but my account was hacked and even with proof that it was hacked all I get is a handful of recommendations that don't even work. I was hacked December 6th 2022 and I still haven't been able to get a hold of a single person, now that I think about it I haven't heard anything from a machine either.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1
It provides so much glitches sometimes the reel doesn't has an audio and the the reel save option didn't came so that we can save our reel in our gallery or album pls fix all this issues if we will tag someone in our reel or pics it didn't provide add back story pls fix it..,1
"Not really happy with the app right now. Too many glitches,especially with reels where you're trying to upload or edit and getting boothed out,and also glitches with the music only able to access one song,having to uninstall and reinstall or constantly having to restart. And ontop of that,a sudden drop in views, like less than 10 or 20 views over a 1 day plus period.REALLY NOT PLEASED WITH THE APP RIGHT NOW. Spending more time on Tik Tok because of it.",1
The only fans ads are getting out of hand and are disgusting. I don't want to restrict my content just because you aren't doing your job taking down inappropriate content which you shouldn't have allowed in the first place. Everytime I open the app there's basically naked women. I've reported and reported but they won't stop. They involved a child once. Do better. It's disgusting and sick.,1
Can't post multiple photos anymore & it now has disabled my ability to share across to Facebook. I've checked my Facebook settings and contacted them. They've randomly switched off suddenly and can't be changed back to sharing to Facebook and twitter.,1
"I am unable to react on message and attach any other person's msg on insta chat .... please fix this issue and it's so annoying, sometimes I feel should delete Instagram account forever, really it's useless app now we don't get proper feature .",1
"I installed to share and store pictures/ videos with friends and family. The app evolved and was great, now it's too much. The process to post a simple set of pictures/videos is discouraging and it seems like they're really pushing new features like reels to keep up with other apps and make a pretty penny with ads and targeted advertising. Feels like the essence of the app was lost due to marketing and the constant effort to keep up instead of being original and staying true to itself. üëéüèΩ",1
The sheer amount of glitches and bugs in this application is insane. Can't believe this is a multi billion company. My account is stuck to a previous version of Instagram and no matter how much I update the application I won't get the new features.,1
The option to add music to stories on Instagram was very good. Now I can't get the option to add music. It would be very useful if the option was there,1
The photo editor is a complete mess. I've finally decided to completely ditch this app for editing photos. No clue why they've ruined this feature so thoroughly.,1
"HELP. It's really annoying how such a huge app that you put money into has so many issues. Last month it kicked me out and wouldn't let me log in. Now it's telling me my account is suspended and I have 30 days to disagree or I lose my account but when I try to disagree and do all the verification steps, it does nothing!! Takes me back to home just to repeat the steps. Why am I even losing my account?! I'VE DONE NOTHING. All I do is like posts and post landscape photography every now and then.",1
"For sharing photos and videos it's been amazing for the most part. However, Meta doesn't care about it's customers and creators, if you get locked out of your account due to 2fa their video selfies don't work even if you have a photo with your face as the profile picture. This could easily be 4-5 stars but Meta/Instagram/Facebook doesn't care enough about their products to actually fix these genuine issues...",1
"Every new feature rollout brings worse additions and more bugs. It's hard to tell who the app is even for anymore. Only 1/3 of the posts I see are from people I follow. The ads and ""suggested reels"" make up the other 2/3s. The interface is not made for reels at all. Go back to basics and stop trying to add a new feature every week. Barely functional.",1
"Trying to install Instagram, it goes through the motions of installing, but thwn says UNABLE TO INSTALL. Yes i have cleared the cache & data on Play Store. I can install other Apps nonproblem, just Instagram. Help!!",1
"Use this app out of necessity...Posting reels is a bit of a nightmare..editing freezes, and often doesn't post text properly. Be prepared to waste a lot of time in editing!",1
"Instagram cannot just let things be. They are now desperately trying to be tiktok and push annoying reel videos at you constantly, they make the sound on the videos difficult to stop or turn down (intentionally), and they feed you suggested posts (and definitely not your friends or those you follow) which are 100% annoying reels and 100% not what people have Instagram for. This used to be an app for sharing images with friends and inspirations. Now it is a shell of some other annoying app.",1
"It's unbelievable how the most recent updates have ruined the apps enjoyability completely. Not only is the app buggier than before, but the interface has gotten worse. Why do all videos by themself have to be reels now? Why is there no longer an option for choosing between a reel and a full video when something is over 60s? It doesn't make sense.",1
"What the heck happened? I cannot express how much I hate the new update. My news feed hasnt refreshed for 4, 5 days now and I am seeing old post. I have to click on the instagram icon, then go to following to see what everyone is posting. How stupid. I used to love instagram but now I hardly get on. Fix it before we all delete it.",1
I got off of Facebook for many reasons. Then they bought Instagram. My experience is that I can message my friends from FB and see cool things. I cannot buy from most vendors because they are scams. I have been scammed 5 out of 6 purchases and had to get my money back through PayPal. Thinking about departing this service too. Useless.,1
"App content (messages,story, profile) are not getting loaded, it's showing loading. I am connecting using wifi other applications are working fine. From 19/11/2022 i am facing this issue. Even I uninstalled and installed the application many time.",1
"Constantly 'crashes' now when you try to upload a post of photos. I do not want to make reels, we are photo people, it was a photo app, let us use it as we wish and let those who love video do their reels. Just stop!",1
"Idk y, sometimes my app doesn't respond and kicks me out. When i click on the icon again...it open for few seconds and again throws me out.....it used to get fixed when i reinstalled it but now, that too doesn't work at all !!! Plz look into this issue.",1
"I am just so fed up with having to make reels to be seen, and on top of that the reel function not working properly. The amount of time my reel uploads and instagram has messed it up or destroyed the quality, the audio, or made the video glitchy -__- my patience is definitely being tested. It's still a great tool for self promotion, but it used to be so much better. Instagram is seriously lacking and is destroying the user experience by trying to mimic other platforms.",1
"Continuous login issues, can not even access my account anymore. Some fabricated ""network errors"" which allow me to log into one account and not my other. The automated replies don't help and there's no way to speak to an actual person to resolve my issues! Doesn't even deserve 1 star!!",1

After following their instructions to appeal the ban, filling the requested info, I am stuck on permanent loading screen. Only option available is to login to another account... Really nice platform you have here facebook. Nice accurate bots. And really nice customer support with no way of contacting you.",1
Veerrey disappointed! Instagram disabled your account by mistake!!!!! For the second time in less than a month Instagram disabled my account for no reason and after trying for 2 days to reactivate it they send you a silly message that it happened by mistake and after few days they disabled it again... its a pure joke and a whole mess.. unprofessional Developers working on this app!!! Avoid it and remove it better!,1
"My instagram is not working, I've tried many a times to install uninstall in android phone. I've report a complaint to instagram then too my problem is not solved. I've called samsung help line number as well, there is no problem with phone as everything is working properly. Worst service since 3 days am facing it.",1
"It's sad what all these social apps have become, just ignorant garbage, fake women, fake videos and every other post is an ad trying to sell you something. What happen to Instagram being inspirational? When it had actual photography, seeing something that inspired or movitated you? They just turned you all into mindless ad revenue, sad.",1
"There is a bug with posting multiple photos being skewed when posting. Doesnt matter if you try and edit, they just end up skewed with half photo black. Please fix. Samsung S20",1
I would like to address my concern regarding the updates of Instagram. It has been above a week that my Instagram feed is not being refreshed with the recent posts. I have tried contacting help desk Centre and reported the problem via app but there's no one to take customer's complaint and resolve the problem which seems very unprofessional.,1
"I've been active on account and have been using the browser version, but when I downloaded the app and tried to log in the app said that my username didn't exist. I dont remember violating any policies and I certainly dont remember being inactive for long bouts of time. Please fix this.",1
"I don't know what is wrong with this app... There back to back issues.... Buffering, missing features, and so many glitches.. can you please fix it... Its really irritating and annoying.. Such a big platform and doesn't even have a proper maintenance and functioning. Damn disappointing... Solve thiss..",1
My Instagram app has not been working for the past one and a half month. I've tried re-installing it several times and all it shows is a black screen. Kindly rectify this! I would like to use the app again since the mobile web is very slow and lacks some of the features. It's started working again thank you!,1
"My identity was stolen on this app and I had to crawl through hoops to get it banned and deleted with no word back as to if this person who was using my pictures, full name, and identity was prosecuted or not. Also, with the new algorithm, I get videos from accounts I DO NOT follow on my feed and most of them are porn... WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS APP. I will be deleting my account and finding a safer place to use ""social media"".",1
"Hey, Insta UI/UX team do you have a lot of free time or what?? Why do you have to change the interface every week? One week the upload button is somewhere and the other week it shifts somewhere else. Whyy???? I'm sure there are other problems within the ui which needs a fix.",1
"1. No music available in library to add to stories and posts. No option to save audio in reels shared by others. Earlier it was there. Now it's suddenly gone. Had aent bug reports, tweeted about it but to no avail..got no response from Instagram team. Which is very unprofessional. 2. Hope we could share videos on stories and feed more than 1 min. And music sticker becomes available in india soon with option to add 1-2 min of musical pieces of songs of our choice...",1
I have been facing bugs after bugs after the update.Now can't hear the music of my story in highlights.And the notes were gone. Now I can't see earlier and latest followers it just stuck there.Try to fix the glitches and bugs as soon as possible.Its a huge organization but you don't providing that vibe now ......,1
Instagram does not shows stories from my closest friends in correct order i.e. it shows mixed stories some of my friends and some of the accounts I followed. Please fix it. I was able to see it in correct order previously.üò°üò°,1
"The app isn't loading the full lenght of the clips posted on it.... and sometimes..if there are more than 4 photosin a post..it wouldn't load them, and when i watch a video...sometimes it jumps to another add video and i habe to sesrch again for the video that i watched.",1
"This has happened to me this past month and late June, where I open my Instagram app and it shows the logo and then the screen goes blank, I am unable to log in and I have messaged Instagram on several occasions if they know how to fix this. I have uninstalled, reinstalled and cleared cache and even tried deleting other apps, to see if it's a storage issue, but no luck. However when it magically worked, it worked for a few hours and when logging out, it appeared to not work again!",1
"I haven't been able to log in to my account for so many days already and when I looked it up on Twitter, it seems like a lot of other people are facing the same issue and Instagram won't do anything about it. There is no more support via email, everything is through the FAQ page WHICH DOESN'T FIX ANY OF THE PROBLEMS AT ALL",1
There's no way to contact a human. I got locked out of my account because of an accusation that I signed up for a service that gives me likes and followers (I couldn't care less about my social media popularity. I just like to scroll). I currently have no way to reach out to anyone to fix this because I don't know my old password and I no longer have access to the connected Facebook account.,1
My Instagram is not loading and refreshing new posts and stories.. It's a completely white blank screen.. For an entire week it's been that way. I've reported it over 20 times and still nothing.. Instagram just needs to shut down rather coz the service is pathetic.. The worst app ever created in my opinion,1
"I'm a long time user. The other day I noticed there were a bunch of friends I hadn't seen post in months. I started clicking on each of their profiles and saw many of them posted within the last week. You're hiding posts of my followers to show reels of accounts I don't even follow. This is very frustrating and takes away from the purpose of Instagram. I use this app to see my friends' posts. If I want reels, I'll click the reels button at the bottom",1
It is not showing anything when i downloaded it ...the page was blankk...i tried manyy times ..but it's the same ... please fix thisss problem...i am facing this problemm . continuously from. 2 months ....i am not able to use insta ....in my mobile phone ....like seriously..it is the worst thinggg happening ... Please fix it fast as youuuu all can üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§å ..the Instagram is also not getting deleted ??,1
Horrible experience. I sometimes don't get messages for days. You it does not allow a person to click on video to see the whole thing. And there is no way to upload a video that is not cut off so people can't see the whole video.,1
"Since the update 2 days ago, I havent been able to see reels or posts when sent them or when I go to the search menu. I can't send messages, all the messages I have tried to send wont go through. Nothing is refreshing. The only thing that does work on instagram? Reels when you press on the reels button. So the app only works... if I want to see reels.",1
I am unable to use my country songs (indian songs) from the last 1-2 week I tried to use Indian songs but no song come after searching exact same title of the song I am getting songs of another country that I don't even know what language they are singing in. Nor me nor my phone is gone out of india in last 6 months. I can listen to songs in Reels but when I tey to use them in my reels no one song found. I thought I have beta version that's why I am unable to so I leave but nothing solve.,1
"Screw it. I keep on trying all unique usernames possible. At first it allowed and at first it shown suggestions however when I agree, it says something went wrong. Now I tried to refresh use my email instead retried all possible usernames, it just says not available. All of it. Even the first one it accepted when it first tried. ""meta"" my poop. Since everything went meta, it gets worse and worst. OVERALL DECENT APP! DECENT MUCH IT MUST NOT EXIST. üòî Sorry but it's real. üíï",1
"Once your known contact mentions you in their stories, you will receive ""add to your story"" in tab in the msg. In my case this notification sometimes works and maximum times it won't give the tab.. Instagram doesn't want to fix this this bug even after reporting this issue multiple times.",1
"After the update my Instagram account is full of trash, I can't send or receive any DM's and I can't open my Instagram it's getting logout automatically every few minutes, it's worst in case with overall experience. I just logged out from Instagram due to this bugsüìõ",1
"New Oct 2022. When I type on a post, to reply, you can't see what you are typing üôÑ New updates, end of 2021, it doesn't play vid well. Sound keeps going but vid is stuck. Need to go back to the old way.",1
Every page on my profile says couldn't refresh feed and shows me nothing. Ive restarted logged out and reinstalled. Nothing has worked. (2022) this problem was completely ignored even tho it was reported by many others. Stopped on it's own after a few months but still ridiculous,1
"Why so many bugs? First none of the reels given in the story can be saved in the reel..secondly whenever I'm visiting some profile and clicking any reel, it's showing an old reel instead of showing the actual one.. What is all this??",1
"Worked fine till the last update. Started freezing, messages are just a circle which keeps turning forever. Feed is not working, videos start for a few seconds then stop all together. Samsung S20 FE 5G. Update fast please.",1
Constant UI issues. They fix one problem then end up having another. It's a recurring problem that they genuinely seem to have no desire of finding a long term solution to.,1
"Comments won't load on mobile. It shows on my time line that I've had a bunch of responses to my comment but when I select it it only shows me my original comment and a few replies, straight up hiding entire conversations. And then when I select one of the other comments on my notifications the other half of the conversation loads at the expense of the other comments being hidden. Really annoying.",1
"it keeps asking me to put in my phone number, everytime i exit it, it just brings me right back. i cant text anyone, cant look at any posts because my feed wont load. i tried uninstalling and installing again but it just does the same thing. it says that the number is invalid no matter which one i put. i would give this a zero, but thats not possible so im giving it a one.",1
"Ditto! Unfortunately there is no option to give a minus figure or zero. 10 months since my last review and incredibly it's now worse than ever. Constantly crashes, locations won't load intermittently. Multi photo option crashes regularly. Sometimes photos load as a black screen. Algorithms don't allow for small and newer accounts to be viewed fairly. 2020 now and still regularly crashing. October 2021, the crashing is incredibly frustrating. Ads non stop. I rarely post anymore which is a shame.",1
Continues to be glitchy. Just crashes constantly. Can't handle more than one photo. Slow and laggy. Can't save drafts either. Edited reels don't post the way you've made it.... Every update makes no improvement.,1
The new update is antagonising! One cannot see the exact time of the text sent or received anymore. Rather it takes you to the profile of the person! Can you change this back to how it was so we all can go back to being normal!,1
"Jesus H Christ...Literally HUNDREDS OF ADS which I just can't get rid of. PLEASE GOD FIX THIS!!! App always fades out in the middle of videos like I've been watching too long. [fully charged, updated] Closes every single time someone in a feed posts anything...same with the constant & completely unacceptable amount of spam and irrelevant advertising.",1
"I'm instagram user. I'm facing a problem in login to my account. I installed it 1 week later today but I'm not able to login again through ""get help login with option"". It is showing ""please wait a few minutes before trying again"". It has been much time to waiting for it but again and again showing the same error. 2 weeks ago, the same problem I faced, don't know why is this problem happening in Instagram login. I'm not really satisfied with your services.",1
"Hello Instagram team i'm begging you to read this multiple of Instagram users has complained about not being able to post 1 minute stories,i was able to do that but now it's removed out of nowhere,and the ""Note"" feature has vanished too please,fix this bug,i want to share content and information but because it's vanished from my account,i'm upset and overwhelmed at the same time thank you",1
It used to be such a great space to meet new people with same interests. Now it's nothing but adds. Very disappointed. When did money become more important than the quality of the product? When FB bought it? Also can I have an opinion to have everything in chronological order? Can I turn off suggested post forever? Not just for 30 days? Must there be more adds than posts from real people I actually follow?,1
"Having issues like the other day. Saying it's going to send me a code to my phone and does not. Can't even use my account. Really annoying Instagram has no real customer support to even speak to. They expect you to go through their help center, but how does someone do that when you can't even access your profile? Doesn't make sense. Want my account fixed.",1
"ads!!! i understand that this app is free and depends on sponsors, but now i am seeing more ads than people i am following. and they are not muted.by default, every app auto plays when.scrolling! only suggestion, fewer ads and auto mute. Now I'm seeing five to six ads per video! How is this app still popular!",1
This last two days I haven't been able to send vocals on my main account and I don't understand why because my account isn't banned or anything. I've tried deleting the app and then downloading it again. It didn't work. Insta please fix yourself.,1
"Latest update for Android users made it impossible for us to Save Image for Instagram Stories that have mentions. What's going on? Neither is the Save Story to Gallery feature working, so I essentially can't save my own Stories to my gallery as long as there are mentions within them. Please fix this ASAP.",1
"My account is not showing new feeds. Have tried all the possible fixes, uninstalled and reinstalled, but my account still wont show new feeds. It's been 2 weeks. Reported to your team but still have not heard a reply. I prefer instagram to tiktok so it's a shame I can't use it anymore.",1
"My instagram account keep stopping for last 4 days and got logout it's own and wasn't able to login again but today I was able to login again but still it's stopping itself, I updated, uninstall and install again, restarted my phone but still it's same thar is my bussiness account I really need ASAP I did even give report but they didn't help me out and I got so disappointed. Please help me out",1
"I've had the app for over 10 years. It's still relatively buggy despite all the changes. But worst of all there's a lot of advertising and recommended posts which appear on my feed whenever I'm scrolling down. I get that it's a free app but it never used to be this bad Edit: and now they've started trying to push recommended posts onto my home feed. The amount of recommended stuff is a lot, I wish they'd keep it in a separate tab for stuff to discover",1
"Recent update wiped out my actual ""newsfeed"" No I don't want to only see 3 suggested reels of people who I don't know. What is this? Slowly getting rid of yet another of the few parts of Instagram I actually liked. This app used to be about sharing photos with friends.",1
Bad Experience. I am Using Instagram From Many Years it Working Properly. But After New Updatw Its Crashing. When I Tried To Sync music With My Video It Would not Sync Properly. When I Message Someone It Automatically Delete And Unsend It Automatically. Application Crashing During Customization Of Date And Time In professional Mode Insight,1
"Since tha last update I can't see photos on peoples pages , only the reels. With the pictures it says ""couldn't refresh page"" . Which is ridiculous. Is this mean this could happen in my page as well? Hope i can get an answer because this is hurting my business seriously and need to move to another platform asap if it stays like this",1
"Sub par experience as of late. I get why there's ads, but the fact I can't turn off suggested accounts on my feed pushes it over the edge for me. I thought the whole purpose of the explore page was to see account you don't follow but with similar content to what you like. SO WHY TF AM I BOMBARDED WITH ACCOUNTS I DONT FOLLOW ON MY PERSONAL FEED. And why is there no option to turn this off in the mobile app. I swear you could atleast stop them for 30 days but that option seems to be gone now.",1
Instagram has so many glitches. My account has converted into old version.all things are changed in it totally.uninstalling and reinstalling it continuously but no use of it .my search bar has changed completely it is showing completely a new posts which I don't see at all please check it once,1
"Disabled my account for no reason which also disabled my Facebook account. No email to contact anyone, no phone number to contact anyone. Now I can't access any other accounts where I have ""signed up"" through Facebook due to my Facebook being disabled by Instagram. There needs to be an ability to speak with a live agent especially for a company that services so many people.",1
"Problems are CONSTANT, and NEVER get SORTED. Give us an option to default the feed to ""Following"", so we get what we want, instead of what you think we want, and a feed full of UNWANTED SUGGESTIONS, and hopefully a feed devoid of Random refreshing to a BLACK screen.",1
WHY CHANGE THINGS WHICH DON'T NEED ANY CHANGES? I have multiple accounts and it was easier to login as I had passwords saved but the new update won't save it despite clicking on save so many times. It's been a headache to use PW on every one of them everytime I login.,1
"So incredibly buggy; I've had to reinstall this app at least 5 times in the last month because every week there's some new issue, whether it be my messages not sending, posts not posting, or the whole app just closing down and refusing to be opened again. Plus: the algorithm is garbage, they keep adding unnecessary features and removing the old ones that were actually useful, the list goes on... Edit: app does not function at all now. It's just a black screen",1
I save a story and it isn't saved. I have lost so many posts due to this. And why would you change the location of the save button. It is so weird why you would change a perfectly normal function.,1
Regarding drawing tool on stories - it appears only when I click a picture via Instagram stories camera. But when I upload a picture to the story then the drawing tool is not there. Can y'all please fix this bug and not tweak something that's already pretty perfect?,1
After updating DP it is not getting update and showing loading continuesly so have to forcefully stopped Instagram. Since then it is not saving any insta story or video. Can you please look into it and resolve on priority. Thank you!,1
Wrost because when I am syncing my song with lyrics by using Instagram song then it's not working..they are buffering tooo much and..not working..i hate this things . I always face this problem and now I'm bloody frustrated. please fixed it..as soon as possible.,1
One of the worst experience after i got hacked. I have my pictures in my instagram account and now someone is misusing. I tried to retrieve by sending video selfie to verify its me but idk if they r blind they say its not belonging to me. Even they can see my pictures in the account. Recovery service is at its worst! No support at all. Its been 2 month now and i have tried toretrieve as directed by insta team for more than 5-6 times. Frustrated! Not gonna use insta ever again! Simply waste.!,1
"Crashes constantly. Was fine for years, but over last two weeks it crashes with seconds of opening the app EVERY time. Cleared cache, deleted data, uninstalled/reinstalled...nothing fixes the problem.",1
"The notification system is garbage. The commenting layout is p-ss poor. It has been years since I received a notification for when a user I subscribed to makes a post or story. When I click on 'show more comments', nothing shows. There hasn't been a day I could go through comments smoothly without any kind of inconvenience. Whichever staff member at Instagram responsible for these should be sacked immediately for their utter incompetence.",1
"I don't know what is wrong going with Instagram.. I think there is any bug in Instagram. Whenever anyone send me any message or reels, It in not shown in notification, and when I open message box and chat of anyone no message I found or It take longer time to update chat. Please solve this type of glitches. Delay in messaging.",1
"I have a crestor account, but even so I don't see 'Insights'. I only get: 'Get insights' where I am asked to get a professional account which I allresdy have. After going thought all the steps, nothing happens... I do not see ""insights"", only ""get insights"". I cleared catch, reinstalled the app, gave all the permissions. It's the same for months. Had really big issues trying to boost a post as well, but I made it work somehow after straggling a lot with it. Really need help here.",1
So unoptimised app UX is been downgraded and whenever i tried to open a link in dark theme and get back to ig app then app changes some components in white theme and also sometimes it takes much time to share reels on story even on faster internet connection. Note feature also not showing. Please improve it ASAP üòë,1
"This app is getting worse day by day with new updates...idk what's wrong with this app since yesterday it's not working properly...I can't access to my saved audios ans I don't understand it. I uninstalled the app, restarted my phone, done everything still it's not accessible.",1
"Won't let me log in. I have tried everything including submitting a video selfie for them to verify my identity, failed 3 times. Email support, get a response that the email is no longer in service, tried calling Meta, no one available to take calls and blatantly said that they will most likely not return calls, sent to help center that provides no actual help. What an absolute cluster...",1
"Terrible app. Locked me out of an account, I was entering the correct password but it still needed further verification on an email I can't access anymore. No other options worked, hundreds of photos gone now. Garbage.",1
First of all the app is so poorly laid out it's painful. Those who enjoy photos should forget it. The app is just a glut of 5 million different ways to post stupid videos. Instagram has never gotten a clue that people don't need their suggested posts and people to follow. None of my photos have ever looked right after they are posted. They squish stuff and cut parts of it off and usually they come out grainy because they can't handle more than a couple megapixels. I have come to realy hate meta.,1
"Instagram told me to rate the app so here it is... This app used to be a simple nice social media app to just share photos. Now it has become an attention seeking, attention span destroying, algorithmic short video platform where it's all about wasting your time like what all the other platforms have ended up being",1
"Blank white screen! Unusable. I have been using IG since 2014 and it's always been great. I now use it for business daily however since 25th July, when it had an update I am no longer able to open the app on my Samsung android phone. It just shows a blank white screen. It has been like this for 6 days. There is no way of contacting customer services. I have sent an email and tried every troubleshooting method online and on forums and nothing! This is extremely frustrating & will stop using app.",1
"Honestly, I would never choose to use this app for its features. I only use it because it's popular. The actual app is poorly designed, and has become buggier and buggier each time it updates. It has a terrible algorithm as a user wanting to see relevant content. The content creation tools are difficult to use, glitchy and I often lose my efforts halfway through. I have so many more negative interactions with the interface, than I do positive ones. This app has become such a disappointment.",1
"Instagram has so many bugs that creating and sharing content is often frustrating. Adding voiceover, music, text etc over reels may just ruin the entire process you've done so far. And if the music you used on the reel is removed from the platform later on, it erases all sounds from that reel (the original audio, voiceovers). Also the drafts don't always save properly, and the recently deleted items can be found but nothing happens when you click on them. Here just some of the most recent bugs..",1
Tried to recover the account after setting up my new phone. OTPs failed to reach through WhatsApp. Not able try another way on the same page. Once I was able to proceed till it asked for a selfie video. App crashed while recording. Still not able to recover.,1
"With the recent update, the Instagram app cannot be opened in Samsung Galaxy Note 10. This is 2nd time I need to uninstall app and again reinstall it. Unable to watch reels or see messages. Reels are not being played or reels get stopped in between Worst update",1
"From a week now I haven't been able to see any new posts from any of the pages I follow. Even after logging out then logging back in, reinstalling the app, updating, the problem still remains. Kindly sort the issue.",1
"There are several issues with app and with next uptades it is even worse! 1. There are too many bots. I report them non-stop for false information or even bullying (some of my posts have 9 likes and 10+ comments from bots!) 2. Making reels is very diffucult and then, after posting, everything is in the wrong place :""( 3. Hashtags don't work anymore! They're totally useless.",1
"The more updated version the worse it gets. It takes too long to upload posts, it is crowded with accounts and posts they suggest meanwhile I don't get posts from those I follow, now it automatically put my posts on reel when I don't want to post reels. The customer support for reporting problems is one sided and never know what happens because there are never a response. Apparently no privacy because their advertising is based on other apps activity or Google searches, they monitor",1
"I am having tons of issues with this app, it keeps logging me in and out, I reset my phone clear cache and data it's still doing the same thing the problem happens every 2 to 3 days. The app will let me log in stay awhile and then log me out back and forth too many damn bugs. Nobody from Instagram staff readies the comments so what is the point of leaving comments if no one's there is going to read them. üòëü§®",1
"This app has many problems you can't open the app sometimes this app doesn't respond . Even when my network speed is high it always shows ""couldn't refresh"". When you try this change your profile or something else it doesn't even respond please fix it Such a waste i want to delete my account but there is no option please fix it i want to delete my account it doesn't understand that I want to delete my account it always tell deactivate silly doesn't understand i want to delete",1
"What the actual F is wrong with Instagram?! I can't log into any of my accounts because it keeps saying username doesn't exist but it DOES. Only left for almost a month because my phone got back, I get it fixed and now I can't access my accounts and I know they still exist because I serach for them with a friend's phone. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, still the same. Please get this fixed ASAP! It's hella annoying for real.",1
I don't understand how every single application I have ever used sends a confirmation text message immediately the same second you click the button but on Instagram it takes upto a minute ends up never coming but I have to wait a few minutes to click send again ridiculous Now I have to use tik tok I don't even like tik tok I want Instagram üò≠ make a customer service line to get help re accessing your account,1
App is not working properly. I am not able to see notes feature on my account and i am not able send messages or use it. Its like the app is hanging again and again. It's so irritating.,1
It was a good app until the update that changed the chronological posts. What's the point of seeing a post posted 5 minutes ago and the next post 2 hours ago and the next one 30 minutes ago. It sucks like that. Please keep them chronological in the feeds. I'm missing alot of friends posts because of that issue. And the Ads are too much to be honest. Thank You...,1
Instagram used to be brillant never had a problem. Now I can't even get into the app it won't even let me open it . I've been trying for months now I want to get into my photos and connect with friends but can't. Very frustrating. App Clearly not working anymore! Don't seem to be the Other person by all the comments and also talking to others. A good app runied!,1
Photo moves to side and posts zoomed in! As soon as I go to post a photo and it goes onto the edit stage before clicking post it moves the image way to the right hand side and zooms in weird snd i can't move it as it does it itself?,1
"I'm just disappointed because I'm not getting emojis on keyboard and swipe reply isn't working and i cannot find the save option to save videos though reporting the issues thier is no response from Instagram team by fixing the problems and so Many times i have been uninstalled and installed , login and logout though the problem is not solved so I'm just hated this ...",1
Why that other people can upload 60 sec video without split but mine willüòëüòëüòëüòë it's very annoying and frustrating when the video get split into many clipsüòëüòëüòë if Instagram team want to upload a new features please make sure everyone can use it at the same time. it's really unfair to some users then can't use the feature like meüòë,1
This app has been trash since meta took over. I constantly used this app everyday for years and now it won't even work properly I constantly have to restart my brand new phone to send/ receive or even sometimes Un-install the app and re-install it just to send and receive. I wish Meta never bought it. üò™,1
Can't see post in chronological order anymore. It's all random posts and lots of advertising now. I just want to see what the ppl I follow are posting in a clear way. Stop doing useless upgrades. Years before the app was much better.,1
"I have to use Instagram for clients, but the amount of time I waste trying get get around all the many glitches is a nightmare! They are so busy limiting people's views that their app is not even working properly any longer. What happened to social media ü§î",1
"One day, Instagram just deleted my account with no notification. And that was that. No one to contact for customer support, nobody to ask what happened, all GONE. All of my friends, contacts and communication gone. It's time to start a new social media.",1
"It's almost 2023 and this old app needs a lot more features. Like rearranging or adjusting dates from posts (change dates) reorganizing posts in chronological order, the ability to merge old posts into one. Etc.",1
"Very good but I noticed recently. After logging in two or three IDs, I can't easily reply to any message after entering the IDs, I have to send separate messages. Other than the likes of any sms easily Nothing can be given that is a little boring.",1
"There is a bug when I complete edit my photos and ready to post on it. The photo will crash and my face will become SKRIK üò± Even though there is no any crash during the photo posted, but the posted photo save into my phone album will be crash too eg: photo reposition üëéüèª",1
"Having some issues, please please please fix this, when I edit a photo and position the cropped photo with multiple photos it will only let me have one in the proper position that I set it, thus making my pictures look uneven when posting them, please fix this, having this issue on my Google Pixel 6Pro.",1
"Please u guys should come help me out... My app has not been working for months now, I can't log into Instagram, I've uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted my phone, clear cache and local storage in the app but none is working... I can't even log into my account on chrome or even create a new account. Is it that u guys don't need me on Instagram anymore????",1
App has not worked properly the past 3 weeks now. I've submitted problems requests several times. Ive used google and youtube to fix the issues and nothing is working. Its sad my employer is pushing the thousands of us to use Instagram for social media presence and we can only see a black screen and cannot post anything. I Thinks it's time to just delete both my personal and business accounts and this app and stick with Facebook. THIS IS RIDICULOUS,1
I secured my account using duo mobile and after a while I accidentally erased my phone data and lost access to my account. I have been trying since to get the 2FA authentication key from Instagram to reactivate my Instagram duo mobile account without success. They are not offering any support through email. WORST APP EVER.,1
This app proves the worse in my case and after reporting technical issues and bugs upto several times. Still the same problems while tackling with instagram. They didn't even work on the issues consumers were facing... being frustrated by such glitches n technical problems I had decided to delete my account permanently as well as uninstalling this useless app which doesn't providing me with updated features. One star giving because they post my review only after that.üòí,1
"Not compatible with the latest android OS. I get a notification, click on it and the whole phone crashes and won't allow me to do anything for a minute or 2. Please fix this as its unacceptable. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. ANDROID 13",1
"Instagram is a mess. I get that reels are the 'new thing' but this shouldn't be to the detriment of the photo posts. The photos that show when I'm trying to upload something are just previously uploaded Instagram photos. I have to navigate to a different album to try and find my photos and you can only upload one of them, so no carousel posts :( it's incredibly frustrating, not everyone likes or uses reels, I just want to look through photos.",1
The app is okay but it has a bug think after update the option to save reels in gallery is missing and now even the draw option is missing I'm a bit disappointed with the app ü•∫ü•∫i have sent a report but i don't know it would work or not but please fix this problem ü§ßüòî,1
I can no longer set themes for chat or use any other emojis to react to messages it just gives me the option to like the message and does a heart. I thought maybe I needed to update the app but I have the latest version so I'm assuming that's a bug too. Not a big deal. Just wondering why it's like that.,1
Every time I watch someone's stories or highlights. It'll glitch out and send me to a black loading screen even tho I updated the app. DM I received will disappear and I wouldn't be to able see until later on. This been happening for 2months now,1
I have very bad experience in last couple of days because my message box is not working properly and after opening the message box the stop working and this problem is coming from last few days.... Just have a look on issue and try to resolve as soon as.,1
"Every time I post something and use the editing features the photos come out distorted and it is unbelievably annoying when I'm trying to post my art. Edit: now its not even letting me zoom in on posts, I just have to leave it in the shape that the original picture was :/",1
All of a sudden I'm not able to see any replies under comments on Instagram unless it's from someone I follow. I don't know if this is some sort of account restriction or bug but it completely ruins the whole app experience for me. Uninstalled!,1
"I'm being harassed by Instagram. I'm bombarded daily by videos of dachshunds and other supposedly 'cute' dogs. I've blocked dozens and filed many, many reports but still the same kind of videos keep coming and filling up my timeline. There is no reason based on my profile to think I'm interested in this banal nonsense. I can accept ads (which insta used to get spot on) but not this new rubbish - the system is broken.",1
Has been really bad for the last 2 years doesn't work hardly at all always freezes story music never works and I don't like how the reels post instead of videos now. The videos were better and looked nicer on the feed,1
It always has some kind of error which is getting very tiring and driving people mad. To me it happened 3 times this month that I got logged out without any reason and got all my personal data required so I could log back in. It deactivated my account outta nowhere and I cannot log back in. Please fix those issues.,1
"I can no longer upload and edit multiple photos. After editing a second pic, the first one becomes corrupt. Deleting the app data and cache did not work nor did uninstalling and reinstalling.",1
My account was automatically suspended for now specific reason. I confirmed my email and verification code now I cannot log in. It's been happening for couple of munites now and still no progress. I've already done the verification and now it has the same error message that says try again later... It sucks.,1
"Feed not refreshing all of a sudden...and no it's not due to any network connectivity issue, it's working fine on my desktop. Tried reinstalling multiple times and even restarted the device numerous times, still nothing.",1
"I haven't been able to use the app at all because it says I need to put in a phone number, but when I do it never sends the code. I don't know if I've been flagged with suspicious behavior or what, but I've never interacted with anything except from my friends in my dms. Can you please fix this or update it so I can use my account? Anything helps, but I have a lot of important conversations I can't even see now [I can't even see my home page or bio]",1
"Can't snooze suggested content any more. I just want to see who I follow, why is this so difficult. If I wanted to find new things I'd use the explore page. Reels have taken over. Overall, it's not enjoyable to scroll through any more, so why bother?",1
Doesn't load properly... No part of Instagram is working properly since prst 3-4 days. Really disappointed by the performance of such a huge company! I've stopped using Instagram. Why? Because it doesn't run at all.,1
"Please Instagram.. when I uploaded the story , after the day it's not shown in edit highlight option. Please solve this... It's struck on November month stories. Afterwords my stories are not shown in my edit highlight.....",1
"Why is it that audio and video can't work at the same time? When you mute üîï the video will play well, but when you turn on the volume, video stops and only sound works. Please solve the problem immediately.",1
"Sir my phone is not running Instagram. Sir my phone has 6GB of RAM and 128 storage but still what is the reason for Instagram not running either your server is running slow because sir I have also installed software in your new phone. Sometimes the head will run for an hour or two and then the head will not work at all. After two or three days, the headache lasts for this long. sir please speed up the server",1
"I am Very disappointed in these days, story can't be save in the gallery, even no such options to save stories, very bad, its better if you do some modifications in the application. Thanks",1
The most annoying and wierd problem is that most of the accounts didn't get new messenger or not an option to update it to latest messenger. Even after reporting it for more than 10 times still problem exists. Didn't except this type of assistance from Instagram (meta). After acquiring Instagram by meta instagram becomes buggy and more buggy with every new update. Please fix the messenger update issue in everyone's account. It's a request after reporting the same from my account.,1
"16 July 2021 It's still outdated version on Oneplus 9R. Please do something about it. New comment 04 Oct 2021 New update sucks. It's so full of bugs. -Nothing can be search. - Can't upload anything. - Feeds not getting refresh. Inta is becoming worst day by day. 26 Dec 22 My new business account is getting so many issues. Tag not working, i cant repost story, my profile details keeps on changing. I mailed Instagram but still no support from them.",1
"My account that's connected to my FB was hacked, and all the pictures were deleted. The confirmation email and phone number is no longer mine, and IG did not alert me when this change was taking place even though I have two step verification. The account is still connected to my FB which means that my FB is at risk. I can't get my account back since there's no picture on the account for IG to match the one they have asked me to take. Also, they won't let me disconnect the IG from my FB.",1
"Would rather be able to upload via PC with full app capabilities, rather than just cellphone. Lately drafts keep listing info. Music disappears from reels, and now even captions a send tags are l gone after posting.",1
"Chat is lagging and I'm not getting notified when people reply to my stories! Replies suddenly appear after 2 days. Also, the app is almost unusable on my z fold3. The problems are getting worse after the recent updates",1
So I was trying to post a photo on my story but it's coming out completely blur and I can't even write anything on it cuz my keyboards not opening when I press A to write and it's really glitchy üòêy'all be adding unnecessary features but won't fix actual problems--- (new problem ü§Ø) I keep replying to my friends comments and it's not showing up and all my old replies are disappearing then coming back after I refresh Instagram like 10 times,1
"Since the last couple of updates, the app freezes or in some cases completely crashes my phone when I try and open the app. I use a few apps and this is the only app that crashes on my phone.",1
"App getting buggier these days. When i go to my following list, when i pressed on sort by date followed: latest/earliest. It doesnt work and still default. Fix these, tiktok is getting better these days",1
My account was hacked and random posts were posted on my feed and this I believe was caused due to no fault of mine. The security in the app should be increased as such problems are not faced by anyone again. Moreover some bug is not letting my feed nor my dms update and its been in a standstill for 2 days now. Please fix this.,1
"And the award for the most useless app on earth at updates goes to...... Instagram üëèüëèüëè. Must be the 3rd update in a row that has made the app worse, can't look at story's as they just zoom away before my eyes even focus on it. Honestly useless !! Due to delete this. Edit: now can't see what I'm typing in a comment üôÑ just gets worse",1
"I love the ability to share posts and memes with my friends and family, and to video chat and send photos through it. However, every time I scroll through my feed now, I get photos and videos of naked women. This is deplorable. I have personalized my account to see less sensitive content, and the app is updated to the most recent update. I report and block these accounts every time. I don't know what else to do in order to enjoy my instagram without accidentally seeing these disgusting posts.",1
"Lot of glitches and bugs. And the app isn't even user friendly anymore. I can't open group chats in desktop app or browser. Sometimes it's there, sometimes it vanishes. And half the time I have problems logging in.",1
"I have nothing to say or to explain about what issues I am facing right now! because... 99.9% my problems is already told by other reviewers and I found most of them telling you ( You developers! ) My most annoying, disturbing issues on Instagram that I'm currently facing now! ( And since a year ago I'm facing the same issues! ) I can tell that I deleted many Instagram accounts and re-created many accounts and re-installed and uninstalled over and over again the App!",1
"App doesn't load the newsfeed, DMs, profiles, or anything properly even when connected to a super fast Wifi. Especially when 2 accounts are linked to it.",1
Reel audio remove option is not working after click it's shows its remove but it never removes and if its your original audio then also it's added to another video audio I don't know why it's going on pls fixed it it's super annoyed it's glitch sometimes after updating its not working pls fixed it,1
"Recently logged out of my account for a password reset, turns out to be that the result in trying to log in is a complete black screen. I restarted my phone including a system update which didn't fix the issue. I uninstalled and reinstalled Instagram over 7 times and now the ENTIRE app is a black screen and not functionable. I can only use the browser version which is 10x slower and uncomfortable to use than the app. Please fix this issue, as some of other people are witnessing the same thing.",1
Used to be a great app. It has turned to be more stressed. How many times did I need to change my password and keep repeating asking to change. I can't login via the app.. only via web. Please fix it!,1
So many bugs when you reinstall it old version is installed and new version is not updated after many requests or reports new features are not added when you reinstall it.... Bad.. worst experience... Not expected this from Instagram team üíî,1
"The business app is littered with bugs on every step. I want to re-boost a post: the app crashes (even reinstalled and still happens). I want to boost a reel: generic error about my products. I check all catalogs from facebook/insta: no error. I try to remove the tags with my products to workaround the issue: i get an error that it can't save. I try to open a support ticket: 3 days later no sign from them. It's the worst software on the market, together with its older and uglier sister Facebook.",1
"I've been using Instagram for years, and this is the FIRST TIME that i would experience this... I can't post a IG story, Reels, Video, Photos or even change my Profile, i thought there was a problem with my phone so had to try it on my MacBook and it's just the same as what's happening in my phone!!! I reported it 3 times, and this is the fourth, I thought it was Only me but it wasn't? I've seen some others too report some kind of these bugs? DO SOMETHING INSTAGRAM.",1
The app is very glitchy everytime I log on to it I get the can't refresh message then the it looks like there's a problem please change your password. My passwords are always random so should not have to change it on a daily basis what is going on. Sort it out,1
"the worst app in existence. too bad i can't give 0 stars. stories get blurred when music is added no matter how fast my internet is. and the text gets some kind of a weird double effect all the time for specific fonts. i wanted to make a post, but it got deleted WHILE i was editing it FOUR times. reels that were created and saved in the drafts since the past ONE YEAR got auto deleted. text feature has too many bugs too. rather than coming up with pointless updates, improve the app.",1
"Absolute pants! Uploading reels virtually impossible, crashes halfway through, constantly telling me no Internet when there clearly is. Templates don't work either really frustrating.",1
"Very bad experience with this app in recent days, i had updated this app after that glitch started the app was not selecting the last video at the time editing, now again i have updated this app, this time another. New issue we are facing. It's not taking video if we are doing short",1
"Not able to send messages, watch reels, reload the messages which is due network connection issues. I have a good network on other platforms like YouTube and all but in this app I am getting connection issues.",1
"Absolute trash. Experience is extremely annoying. There are so many random bugs and glitches in every corner of this app. Instead of pointless updates, developers should initialise fixing the uncountable issues. The newly registered accounts lack so many messaging features, that's it useless to chat on this app for them. Only accounts older than an year or so have usual messaging features. This app literally feels like a newly released, cheap bug filled thing made by a bunch of amateurs.",1
"The quality of pictures deteriorate whenever I put it on my story. Quality of reels when I put on a video, decreases as well. I don't understand why that's happening. This app's crazy. All of a sudden it just goes back to it's earlier versions, like with no dragging options or reacting on msgs option.",1
Full of glitches! Can't change the strength of filters anymore and half the time when I upload a picture it cuts half of it off. Becoming impossible to post. Very poor and frustrating,1
"I think iam going to uninstall the app and I suggest... I am already complaint to the Instagram team about the errors. But they didn't react to my problem.....While using the app my vanish mode may not working, and swipe also not working at the time of chatting so irritating while chatting... So take every small issue as a big issue and clear it...",1
"Dumbest update ever - DO NOT UPDATE. When uploading to your feed, you can't select multiple photos unless it's from predermined albums that are displayed in-app. Even then, only a handful of the photos in that album are display as some weird bug is clearly there. There's an option to browse more albums on your phone and upload photos from there, but can't select multiple, only 1. Looks like no carousel uploads for me anymore ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Fix immediately please üôÑ Using a Samsung S20+ FYI.",1
"Not able to use any option in settings tab. Tried uninstalling & installing this app twice. Still facing the same issue. No video is playing properly, getting repeated posts & stories & unable to log out.",1
Hate seeing random people filling up my feed as a suggestion. Not relevant for me at all. The annoying ratio still exists when cropped to fit when rotating landscape photos. Boomerang recording time may be too short most of the time for a lot of people. Still hate the multiple uploading feature!!! Can never get my pics in the ratio I want it to fit... uploading reel gave me trouble at first & now audio does not work. Now it keeps crashing. Broken app!! Reel uploads are now 10 same as stories. ü§¨,1
FIX THE APP. Instagram won't let you post a video unless you post it with multiple photos/videos so I'll have to uninstall Instagram every time. Instagram freezes when you're going through the stories. Instagram will not load additional photos when you're making a story post. FIX THE APP.,1
"It just shows a white screen whenever I open. I figured I could still acess it just by going to the website, but every website I clicked just took me directly to the app (which is just a blank screen). I then uninstalled then reinstalled and its still a white screen. Edit: I am so done with this app. I can't login because ""my account was banned"" even though I literally just made the account 2 seconds ago?",1
"Ever since October 31, when many people got their accounts banned/ disabled for ""going against community guildlines"" I haven't been able to log into my other account that wasn't effected. Since my accounts are linked to my Facebook and Oculus, I haven't been able to access them also and honestly it's terrible and annoying... I have years and years of memories on both instagram and Facebook. Many of my friends I met when in the Military use Instagram and Facebook and I cant contact them now...",1
"I tired to open instagram but a msg was showing ""message status fail"" in a white screen I tried many times but the same results, I downloaded insta lite the same thing happened, I tried to log in from google and they said they suspended my account and that I have 30 days to disagree with the decision, they asked me for my email I closed Google to see my email then I came back to log in and the site couldn't open. I want my acc back and I didn't do anything for the suspension. Pls help me",1
"Instagram Customer Care Service or Help Center Service is very poor. My account has been disabled by Instagram given cause violations of Instagram's term & conditions. But i don't know which conditions, i've neither comments nor post, hardly LogOn account 4 or 5 times in month. Now i'm want to enable the ID but after complete every process i can't acces the account, every time give the option to create new account. I'm also reporting 2 times for this issue but neither reply nor solve my problem.",1
"Whenever I open the app it just shows the logo then goes blank. I cleared some data the day before this happened and the other apps were fine, i still got to access the apps. I've been installing and uninstalling it many times and I've restarted my phone many times as well. I also kept on deleting the cache and data but it still hasnt worked. Please fix this.",1
"5 ‚≠ê? In a million dreams ! The fact that we get updates almost every week is horrific, ig lags eveytime I try to react to mssgs, type the phone lags or just stay frozen! This is just one of the many because apparently I'm not given enough words to write. However the negative features overpower the good things which is disappointing,keeping up with the updates and yet keep disappointing us : ( Looking forward to your favorable support in this matter",1
"Insta was used to good before now it's terrifying. Every time I open, it throws blank page or says couldn't refresh feed. It's been 2 days am not able open my app and i can't reinstall again and again. Totally facing bad service. Please fix this.",1
"Quite frankly it sucks. One misclick and the post you had been working on posting is completely gone and you have to do it all over again. The so-called saved drafts are also nowhere to be found. The automatic cropping is also annoying. I never get notifications on time even if I have them all on and have excluded Instagram from battery saving. I have to open the app myself to see new posts and stories, it never notifies me on its own. Also, infested with ads and sponsored posts and accounts.",1
Unusable. Despite uninstalling and reinstalling the app several times it does not work at all just says 'cannot load feed' and a black screen. This has been going on for months. I have reported it twice to customer service and have had no response. Will probably just stop trying to use the app to be honest.,1
Instagram used to be great. Then they slowly overtime changed the soul of the app. So many spammy ads. Posts from days/weeks ago instead of recent posts and who are half the people on my timeline Meta? Not the people I follow. Sadly in trying to copy other apps they have lost their way and destroyed what made them unique.,1
When it comes to wasting your time this app is perfect. However to post actual picture it's an absolute nightmare. Please let us post multiple photos with different format,1
"Everytime I open the app, the feed automatically disappears. I can never see any posts from the people I follow because of this. I'm using a pixel 6 with the latest release of Android 13. It's been happening for several months",1
"Many bugs and glitches in the app, I am getting an error of ""Couldn't Refresh"" for the last 2 weeks. I was unable to chat. Even I couldn't see the feeds and stories. Please fix the issue.",1
"Changed too much from the original app. I barely ever see photos from my actual friends anymore. It's all sponsored or suggested posts. Nothing I'm actually interested in. Video uploads are grainy, such awful quality, memories that pop up can't be viewed as they are such poor quality, the images are so distorted. Simple things missing like being able to change the background colour when posting a photo on stories, rather than having the awful colour bleed / fade around the image. Bored of it.",1
Facebook/Meta ruin everything they touch! Don't update the app if you haven't already! Trying to make a post with multiple pictures has become a nightmare. Most of the different pictures become duplicates of each other when you try to edit them within the app! Also keeps randomly flickering as you're editing! Too many glitches! I'm using the S22 Ultra.,1
"My instagram account disabled by mistake. I followed screen instructions and didn't gain access to my account by appealing decison.""you can't request a review"", even i cant submit any forms.... also nobody reply to a huge emails have been sent to support team without any response or even care. It has been bad app ever .........i think its better to uninstall it like me..",1
"I cant log into my account anymore, it said that my account has been temporarily locked due to suspicious activity which was whatever since it happened all the time for me and I'd just enter the code and be done with it. HOWEVER as of a few hours ago, the same thing happened again, only this time i havent gotten the code in hours despite numerous attempts and trying to use a different number doesnt even work for me either. PLEASE HELP",1
Horrible app everyone can decide for themselves what they use Instagram for and if they really need it ... I'm getting my screen frozen and I try to watch igtv videos but they don't work somehow. I try to refresh my page I swipe down on my screen absolutely nothing happens,1
"quite possibly the most user-unfriendly and painful app ive ever had the misfortune of using. you create a post, choose a few photos and then the app decides to crash! fantastic! i didn't wanna post it anyway! not to mention how POOR this app has been for teenager/young adults mental health it is honestly the most damaging app ivr ever known socially and if it wasn't so big in society no one would own it",1
"I've just done a simple as fast test, Every 4 posts 1 is advertise, some times 1 in 3, some RARE times 1 in 6...... No one wants to see ads but above all i don't want to see them at this RIDICULOUS rate! Anyway it is SPREADLY KNOWN that advertise is garbage ans no one likes to see it, on YT it is still possible to block but from ""meta garbage verse"" like face and insta the ads are now coming from the core server as well and blockers can't identify that very well YET!",1
"I can't see what I am typing over my keyboard. After resizing it and then reseting it, what I am typing shows up and stays there unless I click off. I am using the stock android 12 keyboard and this is the only app that does this. Fix for god's sake, commenting is impossible like this.",1
"STILL unuseable üò≠ I haven't been able to get IG to work for weeks. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, submitted reports and updated over and over - barely anything loads or if it does it only partially loads before freezing. On the very odd occasion I am able to post something and then it bugs out on me again almost immediately. Cannot view photos, videos, reels, stories, thumbnails and even my own profile and cannot access post insights. Extremely frustrating as I have a business account.",1
"Too many adds and sponsored content. Too many videos. The people I follow to see their work and photos are not consistently accessable in my feed. Posting a photo is difficult, it wants me to go into reels, and in have to go through multiple menus to get to my camera photos to then find I can't post multiple images in a post from my actual photos.",1
I can't even add music to my stories now. I go to look for music and it keeps saying no results found. Edited 12/10/2022: it's been almost 2 years and still no help. Tried to email no reply. Pinged them on all social medias. Nothing. No wonder why everyone is moving to discord *smh,1
Anyone experience this then please let me know when we call to someone that to audio call it end up with a video call without actually not a video call and we don't have the Start time of the call only we both user having end call with video call ? And more over not in that time also ? If anyone knows the reason just reply back recently i found our call is started in the time of @JANUARY 1STH 1970 is it possible?,1
"Used to be a decent app until Facebook took over. Got locked out of my account and wont even bother to attempt to recover it. Unless you pay for ads, no one sees you on there and all you see are ads every three posts.",1
"What the hell is this happening on Instagram. One problem or the other keeps on coming. For the last four, five days, a Hindi song is not being searched in my ID and many other problems keep coming in it.Only English songs are coming. Because of this I am not able to put any story. Some similar problems had come in the past months as well. Last year I deleted one of my ID because of these reasons.If this continues like this then I will have to leave Instagram forever.",1
"Better you remove the report button. I don't know how many time i report and hiding gambling ads. I click on i see too often, inappropriate and everything i can do. And the result was incredible. All the ads was Gambling and Gambling at every single page.",1
"No issues with Instagram prior to today! I logged into a second account today to post a reel, logged out, and then tried logging back in and the app completely crashed. A blank screen appears every time I open the app. I have uninstalled and re-installed the app, and restarted my phone several times - nothing is working! Please fix this bug asap!",1
"You have to turn off notifications individually. There's 25 of them! Sneaky way of complying with usability standards but hoping you'll miss some and stuff get bothered by their annoying app. Forcing users to block your app at an operating system level is just so poor. Have some pride in your product, instagram.",1
I am just fed up of this new update. It is full of bugs. I'm not able to upload stories. I can't see DMs and reels are not opening. There is a continuous buffering. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app atleast 8 times and still facing the issues from past 10 days. Sometimes it's not working at all. I couldn't even open stories from my connections. I coudn't search any account or anything. I didn't even get the 1 minute story upload update yet. Notes update is also not there.,1
"They just keep adding useless functions that NO ONE in the ENTIRE WORLD asked for, to the point where the app is broken. They don't bother fixing it, they just rake in the add money and pat themselves on the back for being the dumbest, most useless garbage fire of a ""developer"" no one does any work unless it's to further bugg out the app and con advertisers out of money. This app is dying quicker and quicker, to the point that the most basic functions that were introduced day one no longer work!",1
"Open the app: feed resets three times. Scroll for two minutes: feed resets right in the middle of a video. If you want me to engage with content, you need to LEAVE IT ON THE SCREEN.",1
"The app is updated to the newest version but I still can't get any emojis in the DM when I try to react to a video, and yes I uninstalled the app and re-downloaded it and it still won't work.",1
So buggy. Too many crashes. Terrible algorithm for the feeds. Features are too complicated. Poor audio quality when uploading. What a terrible app.,1
"Hey Instagram, you locked my profile for no reason. I am a legitimate user which is why I tried to reauthenticate myself using email and mobile number verification code. But the app is taking way too long (since 30mins) to be precise to authenticate me. All I see is loading wheel. I tried to update the app as well but no luck.",1
My account doesn't have option to react emoji on any message in chat. Also it doesn't have option to reply a message. While in most of account we have option. Uploaded media quality reduced. Full of bugs.,1
"I am not getting any kind of notifications from the Instagram, my all notification settings are turned on. This is so ridiculous. I tried uninstalling and then installing but nothing is fixed",1
"Issue #1-Literally all about ads now. Can barely see anyone's feed due to ads. #2-Videos auto playing eats up my data, there's no way to switch off auto video play. Data saver doesn't help.

Disgusting how you allow child porn and child porn accounts on your app!",1
"Lots of bugs and can't handle the app smoothly . Not able to reply, react to msgs . Too bad experience. After many complaints also the problem is not rectified. Not able to change the theme n soo many glitches .",1
"I won't recommend anyone to use this app if you don't want to lose your account without any faults. They will delete your new account without warrant reason, although you didn't do anything. I have been deleted twice. They say I broke the rules, but I just signed up and didn't do anything. This made me very disappointed with this software.",1
Good app with worst algorithm to show garbage everytime. Only nudity and sexual content is being shown. If you like one single image with even slightly indication to nudity it will start showing only nudity. Then again report and hit not interested for next 100 video and maybe it will go back to normal. People Even promoting child pronography in comment and sharing sexual content.,1
Welp Instagram is bullcrap. Says I am banned but won't explain what for and won't allow me to save my account when it clearly gave me the chance to do so. Unless someone has reported me enough times or my account got hacked. I no longer have my main Instagram account nor my art account for some unknown reason. I literally did nothing wrong and it ticks me off that this can easily happened and I doubt it'll get fixed which is beyond frustrating.,1
"I want to see pictures/posts of people I actually know. I hate that you only see the posts of pages with lots of followers. Yes I know I could just not follow them, but I occasionally would like to see memes/celebrity pages too. There should be an option to have the feed be in chronological order.",1
2022 is going to over and Best thing about Instagram on Android is never stable as IOS and on android which is filled with only bugs. It is shocking still not working fine on my Galaxy S22 Ultra. God knows what tech team are doing. Even a small company fix bugs but a multi millionaire company are still not able make a simple stable app.,1
"Reels are super important when it comes to reaching your audience but it never works properly. Whether the text background doesn't post or the audio doesn't want to load itself, it's just highly frustrating and truly poorly designed. Super disappointing and Instagram has been my go to social media platform for years but now it's just become a headache.",1
My insta doesn't show me reply feature. Can't reply anyone on selected message. Many things also missing and many times my messages doesn't show to other person. I tried updating messaging but this feature is not available only. Very pathetic service.,1
As a business owner I haven't gained any new followers in a week. I have lost followers. How is this happening when I run ads? My Ads are not being seen and reels are not getting seen. 11/4 update: i have nit gotten a response from Instagram. I report all issues and mainly within my business page. No one responds to fix the problems.,1
"Once again, stuck on the ""processing"" part for reels. It's super annoying. I use this for work and reels are how I get my work out there. Please fix this, again.",1
"Instagram ruins every picture I try to post. I used to use insta to share my photography, but now I can't upload a photo without Instagram cropping the picture and ruining the quality. Instagram used to be about photography. now it's all ads, porn, and bad memes recycled from tiktok.",1
"Trash. A poorly made garbage app. Wish the people in charge could at least pass a basic intelligence test, clearly they have not. Glitches and bugs constantly, app randomly quitting constantly, functions horridly and all the extra features that have been added are the most useless wastes of existence ever. Not to mention CENSORSHIP. Oh, and everything you do on the app will be ""violating community guidelines"" if you dont subject to communism.",1
"Coz very bad glitch is going on now a days everytime I have to uninstall n then install to just accept the request of collaboration of any reels or post i don't know why,can u please tell us what is an issue and it happens from my both the device,not only in one phone... So for me it is really very bad now... I cannot see my comments in my comment box, comment is on still cannot see any since last week & it's kind of very irritating thing...",1
"It has become an worst app... Unfortunately i forgot my Instagram password, when i tried resetting forgot password option itself is not working properly.. there's an severe bug, technical team pls try fix that first. Very disappointed with this feature.",1
6 months ago I had an account ban since then trying to get it back seems impossible. I have followed instructions and had no reply. I have another account and the amount of actual porn on here is crazy when reported I get a message saying that they are to busy to review it. What if a kid see's it?? How is Instagram Facebook and meta even still a thing?? Much better apps out there with less bugs and more importantly less ads,1
"The recent update ruined the app Everytime I try to open DMs of someone the app crashes... Re-installing, clearing cache and data did not help... Forced to use the web version on phone which does not even allow you to tag messages",1
"Change the app name to buggram .. too many bugs .. sometimes the search option disappears , sometimes when you click on a notification it doesn't lead you to the original comment, and sometimes the replies dosent show.",1
"The instagram app does not delete the wideos on reels that i reported and instead, it came more and more videos of the same content that i hate. The ""not intrested"" option does not work.",1
"Insta has been messing up lately, some messages won't show up till I uninstall and download it again but the cycle is getting annoying, and there's some glitches that's been a bother for a while. Please fix this",1
My inbox wasn't opening from last evening and this problem wasn't solved till today afternoon. So I decided to uninstall it and reinstall it but after doing this Instagram app is not even opening. I'm facing this issue from last 12 hours.,1
"During recent weeks, I've had several near-heartstroke experiences using Instagram, cause it's just missing many essential features, and it gets more terrible with each update. Tonight, I wanted to switch to my personal account, but all I saw was a blank page. So I logged out of my professional account, and still no login page was shown. And that's how I'm no longer able to log into either of my profiles. I had to send sb an important DM with my personal one. Good job for ruining that.",1
My account was hacked and I sent emails with all the details. Nobody responded. My email was changed and my phone number was deleted from my profile for no reason by someone who just did it. I deleted the app of course despite the fact that my account was ok at the end. I don't trust Instagram and Facebook anymore.,1
"New update completely wrecked this app. Tik tok wannabe, reels have completely taken over and you see nothing that you actually want to see anymore. My story has been broken for months and apparently it's a known issue that Instagram hasn't fixed, All photos are just black Squares and text is a pixelated mess. This app used to be a photographer's best friend, and now its suppressing our work to plug low effort reels. Honestly don't bother with it.",1
"This app needs to be fixed. First I'm unfollowing people like 4 or 5 and the number is not changing, 2nd its really slow and it stucks, 3rd I would appreciate it if you put a section with who unfollowed you,3rd apps doesn't work anymore and instagram is strict so I don't want to lose my account. Also I think instagram doesn't care about the users anymore you are not helpful at all and you are not doing nothing to prove the app,that's why I'm rating you with 1 ‚òÜ",1
"It used to be an ad free environment. Now it has too much ads! Edit: still a lot of ads. As in 1/4 posts I see is an ad. Edit 12/26/21: keep crashing whenever im choosing 10 pics for a post. Edit 8/15/22: always having problem with your UI. Sometimes when I type, my keyboard is covering what Im typing and I cant see the message Im composing. Still has a lot of ads.",1
Bi annual update: Gets worse ever quarter.. Endless Bots & now I can't have notifications on as Bots keep spam liking my stories. The last social media platform I use and even at that I bearly use it now as it's gone so bad. Instagram are just focused on trash celebs and trying to push the seller platform. I can see most of these platform dead in a few years,1
Reels are not working correctly. When I add audio it only plays as white noise. First issue seems to be resolved. Now crashes everytime I try to add a reel,1
"To be honest your team is not responding to people's problems so first improve it. And solve this ""thanks for providing information to Instagram"" as soon as possible. I'm using it from last 3 years but nowadays when it merged with Facebook these problems occuring frequently lots of glitches, bugs needs to be taken care",1
So many bugs but still always updates are available then why those bugs are not rectified. After every 20min of using or watching status mainly it always shows app not responding where my device and the app itself is up to date.,1
After the new update i have been facing so many bugs...i can't see dms .. can't view stories and can't see any post in the feed... there is continues buffering ...i have uninstalled and reinstalled several times and still facing the issue past few days and there is no response from support team....i am just fed up with this app,1
"Writing this review on 31st Oct 2022 ... I'm a musician , Singer from Lucknow INDIA .(Pranjal_mikaelson) I was scrolling through reels and all a sudden a message popped up that I need to verify my account.... I did verify it Gmail and phone no. But then the page just kept on loading currently it's been an hour and I'm really frustrated... My friends told me that my account is not showing up on Instagram. This is wrong.",1
"More crashes then the m1! Since having a new phone all it does is crash videos are out of sync, constantly freezing and not working, go back to my Samsung s20 and its perfect!!!",1
"I tried to create a reel but after selecting the video, I only saw green interface not the video I actually posted. I tried clearing the app data, uninstalling and installing the app again but nothing changed.",1
"Phone got hacked and I had to reset everything and lost my 2FA access. I still have access to my email and mobile number, but the stupid ""Video Selfie"" does nothing to help no matter how many times I try. I have all my dog photos on that account and it's linked to another Meta account, but you still won't let me in. I can confirm all the information you want, but your website doesn't provide any way for ID card verification or anything other than the video selfie option. Help me!!!",1
"Having issues again... lost all my drafts again... new thing is that when posting multiple photos, the photos aren't centered therefore, leaving a right hand border on majority of the photos.",1
This is one of the only social media apps I would use it has so many bugs and glitches every once in awhile it will just be blank when I try to go on my account it says can't refresh feed or just the most random stuff please fix your app it's annoying,1
"I first have to talk about the apps whole shift to video, I come to the app to enjoy a photo experience, no sound, no movement. But 90% of my feed are reels, going to someones page and all I see are reels. Reels need to be separated from the rest of the app. The DM feature is very bad. It's pretty bear bones, you can't edit messages and notifications are sent for every single message. Simply annoying. The app is buggy, I can't post heic photos, stories don't upload and dms don't send.",1
"Why add a feature that doesn't even work? When trying to remove followers i pressed manage, select all, and remove, it doesn't work at all. It just says, ""action failed, please try again later"". Now I have to manually press remove TWICE for every single account.",1
"Haven't been able to use it due to constantly having a black screen reading ""couldn't refresh feed."" I have tried all the 'fixes' and nothing worked.",1
They finally fixed reels and it worked well for a while. Glitching yet again with the video shrinking to a corner after the first few seconds.,1
"are you even listening to our problems Instagram? I've got no option for replying to a msg ever since I downloaded it, even with updates I thought it will appear but it doesn't and recently from the camera dragging up to my gallery I can't find any photos even if I touch them they don't appear, so I uninstalled and installed again but my photos don't appear even if I make new account my photos don't appear So the problem is with instagram please fix itüôÅ",1
"Very bad experience. My three are closed. From which 2 of them are fully functional one is sheheryar_shahid060. Second, knowledge blogs. Third one is less active ie Sherry Chain shop. When I give my password or try to link to Facebook it says error try again. It happens every time when I try login to instagram. If my issue get solved I give instagram 5 stars. But after solving my issue.",1
Worst i am not able to see anything screen is going blank too much time for refreshing i am not able to see reels or any stories anything i wish I could remove this 1 rating also please solve this at the earliest. I don't know what's the issue with this app,1
"Getting worse and removing features in every update! What is wrong? And again they took out the drawing pen in this update, why are you guys doing this? It's so hard to edit a story now Bring back the drawing and erasing features, why do you keep on removing featuers always which are being used heavily?",1
"Instagram requested my phone number to add to my account!! I tried to add it and it went send a code and I can't get into instagram by any means Including the other ways they sent ,codes to my email don't work! Can't change password just keeps asking for a phone number which it won't accept üò° I need help but can't get any help because I can't get into my dam instagram üò°",1
"I barely use the account.I use it maybe once a week to caught up with family and art. I opened the app and was suspended. I verified my information and then my account was gone. I can't log in, I Uninstall and reinstalled it. Nothing, no response from tech support. Just deleting the app permanently.",1
The stickers automatically disappear after setting the story. If you are not able to handle the app then give it to someone else. Your META will not work because you have all the social apps.üò°,1
I got a new phone recently and have been trying to log into 3 of my accounts with no luck at all. Every time I type in the log in information it will show some error or ask you to try again later. Even though on other devices everything is fine? It's absolutely frustrating!,1
"Idk how does Instagram manages to mess up the basic functionalities?? Since the recent internal changes my explore has entirely changed, I can't see a single posts of my interests. Besides, I can't see a single comment under ANY posts including my own. More than half of the reason to use this app is gone for me. Please fix it, you have a beta version for a reason, please stop rolling out updates without testing them.",1
"IG shows too many reels from people I don't follow. There should be some kind of setting that helps users choose which to see. Additionally I find similar contents on the app that IG allows to be posted, while it restricts me from posting them. Such dissapointing AI development for a massive IT company.",1
"The sign in is already annoying enough with the emails and waiting THEN you have to but your damn phone number and after you put you email once you have to do it again for ""confirmation"" and wait 3-5 minutes for all of it im like 90% done with signing in and I'm not even interested with this app anymore why is there soooooooo much security? Is you app that unstable I'm not downloading this anymore.",1
With the new update you have ruined my user experience. Yall have shifted the activity button beside the message button. The comments section no more shows how many likes I have on my comment and don't show who has liked it. Neither can I see the list of replies on someone's else comment. This has become soo annoying. Bring back the old system. My user experience is totally ruined.,1
"Multiple errors that you can encounter when registering. Blocking you for no reason from creating an account. Cannot continue pass ""agree to terms and conditions"" when creating an account. No customer service to help solve technical problems with the app or website.",1
Banned my account for no reason whatsoever. I haven't posted anything except some old photos of me and follow things from talkshows. No reason given and no way to contact someone to reverse it. Meanwhile it's full of nude pictures and accounts that are just full on links to porn. Ridiculous. Maybe I'm not skanky enough for their platform?,1
"Super slow app. I think it was because the camera feature has so many many unnecessary functions that makes Story with the app itself is so goddamn slow and unresponsive. Instagram Lite can't fulfill my needs on the Story itself. Appalling that it's basically tell you to upgrade your phone to a performance similar to what iPhone does. I'm happy with my Android, but I think it's time for a competitor to let Instagram down for good. Thank you for the experience you used to gave to me.",1
"It is messing up the photos, after i try to adjust them. It does not work to straighten them, they have weird gaps and are uncentered. If i fix one photo another one gets messed up. It makes the apl totally unusable",1
Haven't seen a more buggy app in my life. One day I won't be able to add any stories or won't be able to send images in chat. Another day I won't be able to post an image. At this point I am just using the app on and off due to the sole fact that some of my friends still use this pile of poo poo.,1
"I just lost my account because of some glitch and now I'm not able to login on that account And they always shows me community guidelines like limits of liking posts, limits of follow and unfollow, etc.. this app is getting worse day by day by every update the numbers of bugs and glitches were increased and we can't see any improvement many times reels were stop but the background music were playing and sometimes we can't foud the music which is used in other reels and stories",1
"so many glitches in app while i was commenting popup bar goes down. if i scroll down it get updated and start from the main page again. sometimes you dont even know that the other person replied to yr comment or not. bcz it notify sooo late ..and when you click on it, it take you to some other place ..you better resolve it mark",1
My explore page has been messed up with generic nature photos for months and nothing i do seems to fix it. Only reels show content im actually interested in and if im only going to watch reels then i might as well just go to tiktok.,1
Today I went onto instagram and was told that my account was suppened because it didn't follow their community guild lines. I tried to disagree and followed the prompts. After confirming both codes that were sent to me via email and text they decided to delete my account. I'm quite annoyed and really frustrated that they did this without allowing my to appeal. They also don't have a contact centre so there's no way to recover my account. An absolute joke.,1
I dont know how to recover my account now. It has been hacked. It asked me what email address I prefer for you to send out the steps but it did not send me anything. This hacker set up a 2-authenticator thing on my account and enjoyed sending multiple scamming messages to my friends. Even was able to access my yahoo email which I was just able to retrieve earlier. YOUR APP IS TOO EASY TO MANIPULATE AND IS NOT SECURE. I even cant get help to stop it.,1
I couldn't able to post any photos or reels videos in this app. The posts are still posting in the notification bar and not posted... I couldn't stop or delete the uploading posts. It is fixed when the app uninstalled and then reinstalled. üòíüòí,1
I'm so annoyed by this app. It only shows nature's pics on my explore. It gets down so often. It's not same anymore. And these bugs are not getting fixed for months. This is so disappointing.,1
"This ""every video as reel"" feature is so bad. I was obsessed with the way nmbr of views (instead of likes) shows below the videos Now it's extremely difficult to transform each video into 15 min long Saying no to reels",1
Initially I really liked this app. But now Im just disappointed. My account has been temporarily locked due to phishing. So I tried everything on the app - nothing helped. Then I contacted the facebook team. They tried assisting me for a bit then they just stopped replying. I still haven't gotten my OWN account back. Even the face video confirmation is making the app close or says that its not me in the pictures of my account. Like excuuuuse me?! I expected more from instagram. Pease do ur job,1
Since the update I struggle to login. I always have to reboot my phone just to be back into the app. Please fix your bug because I used to like logging in without issues and now this app is the only app that never goes online unless I restart the phone,1
"Was in the process of signing up, hadn't even finished the process, when up popped a 'you've been suspended' notice. What gives? I can't be suspended when I haven't even finished the blinking sign up! Uninstalling and won't bother trying again.",1
"I have been using this app for years. And all of a sudden, like it's gone. Whenever i open the app, all i see is a blank screen. Tried to update my phone, deleted and re-installed instagram, checked every phone settings, but still does not work. I tried to log in using the browser of my phone, anf it was fine. This frustrates me.",1
"I‚Äòm having problems with the filter section. Apparently, it doesn‚Äòt give me all the filters I‚Äòve saved in the past. It only shows the ones I‚Äòve saved recently. Please, fix this.",1
"Every time I try to post multiple photos it will duplicate the first photo when I try to edit the rest, there is no fix. App is trash üëé already deleted my Facebook two months ago, looks like Instagram is next.",1
"Instagram stop trying to be tiktok. I create content to be posted on this app in the normal video format because that's what works best for what I do. Making it that I can only post a reel is so frustrating and eliminates one of the unique aspects of your platform compared to tiktok. Please stop adding new features randomly, it's very frustrating and off-putting for content creators who are using your app.",1
the app was working well but I had to take it off from my phone because my storage was full. I eventually was able to install Instagram again and it wont open. When I open the application it only puts a black screen and I cant do anything. I'm really upset because I used this application to talk with my friends and keep up with my favorite artists.,1
"For newest update: when in dark mode them for app, it will sometimes glitch and go back to light theme and mess up the way dark mode looks. Makes it really difficult to work around the app when this happens.",1
Pleasr help to rectify the issue on the White Blank Screen that happens when I click into Instagram. I could not do anything besides staring at the blank screen. Tried countless ways to get back my IG but it doesn't work!! It is super frustating!! Many users are experiencing this issue too as seen in the reviews! Please do something about this! IG reputation is going to drop if this problem still persists for months! There is no number to call or email address. This app is not user friendly. üò§,1
"I have to uninstall, restart my device then reinstall the app every time I want to post a video. This is on my phone tablet and pc. So not a problem with my devices but with Instagram. Used to be a great app, but when they made every video a reel they must have messed up the programming as that is when the probs started. I've reported the issue many times but no contact, no resolution. I still use it as I have to for my business promotion, but its a terrible experience.",1
Unable to make a reel. When I put the song and in the process of syncing the song. It stoping the app. And shut the app instantly.,1
It gets stuck and sometimes Reels won't reach anyone unless you delete the video and repost in a different time. The app is getting stuck its a constant headache thinking of leaving Instagram. inconvenience ü•≤,1
I just gave my phone a factory reset. I lost all my account and forgot the password to get into. I requested the email to reset my password. But I am not receiving it and I also send a recovery request to Instagram 5 days ago but they haven't recovered my account. The two factor Verification is on and the Duo Mobile App is not backing up my account and I also don't know a backup code. Please do something I want My Accounts Back At Any Cost or I'm gonna uninstall this application right away,1
"The app freeze all the time with videos, reels quality is extremely poor, there is no way to put captions in videos or story if you are not in the USA üëé (I'm french and we don't have access to this feature)",1
"I wish i could give it a zero star!!! It's literally so irritating, my account is automatically logged out and the bugs are also not fixed. Not a very smooth going app. Utter waste of time, battery and internet.",1
"I tried so many ways but after resizing or rotating the image, other images will either change back to normal, which it'll get cropped after posting or the image will be slanted when rotated. PLEASE FIX THIS!",1
I don't know what's going on with Instagram at the moment it literally keeps closing on its own every single time I open it please fix this UI problem because it's also saying Instagram keeps stopping!ü§¶üèª Update: Instagram is STILL closing and giving me pop ups telling me that Instagram has stopped!ü§¶üèª Another update: STILL no response from the Instagram support team and Instagram is STILL constantly crashing and giving me pop ups telling me that Instagram has stopped ü§¶üèª,1
"I have been using Instagram for several years now, and the experience has become awful since Meta/Facebook bought it: - Lots of video freezes and other bugs they do not care to fix. - Zero user experience: we cannot automatically go to a page's first posts; we are now ""forced"" to create reels; the ""search"" feature for posts is mediocre at best... I do not recommend it. Instagram has lost its authenticity.",1
"Stupid app, it automatically turns off the screen when I do video call. And the mobile gets locked and I didn't make a proper call either it's audio or video. Both stucks.",1
"A random guy made a profile posing as one of my good friends. The profile claimed that she posts sexually explicit material. She identifies as asexual and so that didn't make sense for her personality. We have gotten everyone we know to report this page, yet Instagram has not done anything about it for 1 week. The account is still up and running. If this goes on for a month, i wonder what kind of security Instagram actually has.",1
"Super glitchy, lacking any sort of customer service or support, my reels are posting upside down and have been for days. I tried all the troubleshooting methods to fix it and nothing works. Seems to be a problem with my account ONLY. Fix your glitches Instagram.",1
"Not only did it log me out for no reason, but i cant get my account back due to me never receiving a code through my phone number. I got no explanation as to why this is happening yet i know your staff sucks when it comes to recovering accounts because of the amount of complains ive heard regarding that issue. Please fix your goddamn app, you've led so many people to loose their accounts over a bug you guys cant seem to fix nor try to help with.",1
"I no longer enjoy using this app at all. The recent updates that have made reels the only content in the feed have made the user experience extremely unpleasant. My entire feed consists of either reels by strangers or advertisements. While I don't mind seeing a few reels, I'm tired of seeing nothing else. It seems like Instagram is now almost exclusively a short video app where users must film, edit and post videos or have their content hidden even from their friends!",1
This app is so annoying it's not even funny. I got offered monetization suddenly the monetization stuff has disappeared. Also every time I try to go to my insights it keeps making me set up my profile again again and again so I can't even see my insights this app has just gone down hill because they keep making unnecessary changes that nobody asked for and everything that I see people ask for never gets done I who is actually in charge of all of this because you guys don't look at feedback!,1
"My Instagram account is not working properly. I am not getting the swipe option, theme change option and can't react upon any message. I am not getting this functions. But in my second account these all options are coming. Kindly fix all these issue's as soon as possible.",1
"Instagram is taking 768 MB place in mobile phone. It is one of the most social media accounts which is taking so many places in cell as compared to other social apps. In addition to that my friend, families members, relative and I deleting Instagram app due to that reason. So it's my hamble request to you take it serious action on it. Other wise every one will be delete Instagram app in the future.",1
"Trying to delete old posts and stories and I keep getting ""Your post wasn't deleted. Please try again later"". I am about to delete this terrible app and never recommend it to ANYONE. I am tired of getting this stupid message. Get it together Instagram. For all considering this app, NOT WORTH IT. If you want to be bombarded with error messages constantly this is your app. I've deleted the same story THREE TIMES. I HATE this app. GARBAGE!",1
"A recent change means that searching for hashtags now only shows the top 9 results, with no way to see more. This has made the app completely useless for finding images.",1
"My account was wrongfully suspended, and there is no support at all. The email is inactive and the help center did nothing, but lead to a wild goose chase where I ended up coming to the realization that they just don't want to help. Instagram itself is completely money driven, if you don't have a business or product linked to your account they most likely won't even respond to you. You are not valued by anyone in charge of this app unless you benefit them in some way. It's all about the money.",1
"INSTAGRAM SUPPORT PLEASE HELP. I am not able to access my account because I have lost the 2-factor authentication app and recovery codes. I am giving this rating because of very poor customer support, they don't have any support email or channel where users can connect for help. Even the video Instagram team is recording the verify the account, they are not replying after collecting the video itself. Customer Support 0/5 üëé Otherwise, the app is 5/5 üëç",1
"Worst app and user experience is too bad, feed not refreshing, full of bugs . All apps are working good with cellular data and Wifi but Instagram is not working properly.",1
The app is just annoying atp. There's constantly another dumb update that comes along with hundreds of bugs and then when your finally used to the update they update it again and introduce another dozen bugs. There's always something not working which is super frustrating.,1
Not receiving SMS message for 2 factor authentication. I can't get any actual tech support from a live person. I can only log into one of my accounts. I should be able to log into both of them with one log in. Fix the f@#king SMS 2FA issue please!!!!,1
"I am so sick of the constant changes. I'm sick of instagram pushing content into my feed from people/brands I don't follow. Today's change, they reckon I've caught up from posts from the past three days. I have one post to look at, then it goes to a sponsored ad and then other content from creators I don't follow. I want to see the content from people I follow. I follow over 2000+ accounts, can't tell me I've caught up on content. Stop changing things around.",1
"Super annoying, I edit my photos, adjust the position of each photo when publishing several photos in one post and Instagram publishes them in whatever position it chooses!! ANNOYING!! üò°",1
"Exactly how is posting decent photos of my own content goes against community guidelines? Instagram is getting more absurd. If the Instagram moderators think I have posted too many photos at a time or for a day, then just say so? Furthermore, why also does this annoying ""Please wait a few minutes before you try again"" message keep popping up? Instagram is getting worse and these issues need to be fixed.",1
Instagram's latest features doesn't show up on my account. I tried re installing and everything. Logged in with my friends I'd and it shows all the latest features in it.,1
"My account which I've been using for 2 years now suddenly has none of the new features like, reactions to dms, that [+] thingy on top, I can't even add theme nor swipe to reply to a certain text, I had it all till yesterday but suddenly everything just vanished, please fix the bug",1
"Unable to Like posts, continually get an error that intimates my account is not in good standing or that the action I am performing is against ToS (all I am doing is tapping the Heart icon to Like posts). I have reported this twice with no response in-app. Just the type of service I expect from Meta-owned companies. Totally useless.",1
I am not getting to upload 1 min videos on my story. Its limited to 15 secs only. Everyone around me is able to do the same but even after updating the app regularly I don't have that feature. Kindly update the same for my account or help.,1
"- > why can't I open Instagram, and why? Is there any improvement, please inform me and fix it again so that everyone can enjoy using Instagram ? -> the problem is when I want to post the story it's a bit slow and I don't know why I can't add the followers, what else do the other followers have an error so please fix it, bro, thanks :)",1
"I can't opperate the app for a few days since 27 Oct 2022. I do uninstall and clear cache after and before reinstall the app. But it still show blank, without any post or even feeds. I even tried to log in at other phone, but goes the same. Please fix this asap.",1
"Try to make a post, the app hangs up and switched to Story mode instead, and then crashes. I've cleared the cache, reinstalled, cleared the data, etc...still broken.",1
"This application was connected to my Facebook. However, one day I went to watch a reel of one of my favorite and it said all my stuff was ""disabled"" and "" sorry can not be freshed"". I don't post reels, I will sometimes share a reel I like, I don't message in this app. There was NO reason why they shut my account down (unless it is illegal to share bird and food video's.)",1
I am not able to send and receive the messages from my account.... But on the other hand a different account is running well from the same phone only..... Don't know what is the problem with my account nd they are not able to resolve it.,1
Its high time to add music option in Mauritius We cannot continue like this We can't even hear others music in their story or post!!! Please @instagram add the music option in Mauritius Island overall its a good app!,1
Lost access to my account all of sudden. Password recovery doesn't work. Keep saying something is wrong and try again. No user support at all... Don't know where to report and track this issue,1
"I have updated my instagram each and every time they show to update the app but am still not getting the updated version like notes and recent like,etc. Instagram team are the worst team i have ever been came across i have report my problem so many times they seem to have no interest in public issue. Back then instagram was too good but now vice versa. Totally disappointed!!! Instagram team do some work .",1
"After update I have been facing problems. Sometimes when I open Instagram only buffering has been seen.. like, it looks like server down . No profile. No reels. No other update, nothing can see. Only buffering.. please solve the problem as soon as possible..",1
"I wouldn't recommend the app to anyone due to the amount of 'Creeps' on Instagram, the fact that in their rules people aren't allowed to be on the account have a account and you can't report them for it so basically it's filled to the brim with 'creeps' so basically Facebook goes against their rules almost immediately. The ads are completely unforgivable due to amount of Sexual inappropriate ads that are on there is just beyond my understanding.",1
"I've been facing a lot of bugs with the app lately, it's been going on for a month now. My stories were suddenly disappearing, and sometimes I wouldn't even be able to view the stories of those I'm following properly.",1
"What a mess. First of all Instagram is like Twitter. Almost every account leads you to porn sites. Second when I tried to change my number it didn't even give me a verification code. And now my account has been suspended just cause I entered the wrong age and it won't let me log in cause your service is so slow that it has 2 hours since I sent my selfie for a ""robot or age"" or whatever. I won't change my rating until these problems are solved!",1
"Either you shut down this app or either you have to do something to fix the bugs as often it has glitches, it asked my phone number in the name of some security n some other things and when I didn't provide it so I couldn't access on insta so yeah I had to. Plus I just updated and still the bug occurs, when I click on search bar in DM section, the app gets forced stopped. Due to the red mark with interjection I can't updated other reels on my stories(dnt tell me any excuse such as privacy).",1
The quality of this app is lacking as new features are being added the server is slow af. And i can't seem to find the music option for my story or react to messages.,1
I'm unable to login into my account!!!!! please help. The app is telling me to try again later but when I do it's just showing an error! There is constantly some or the other bug in the app not really happy. Requesting to help me with this problem. HEY! JUST FIX THE BUGGGGGG TF? üò≠,1
"Bad. Just awful. It crops everything you want out. Instagram, this is your purpose, your basic function is to upload photographs, and you can't even do that right. SHAME.",1
"App has many bugs buddy, some time u can't even add people in group.. if u msg a person the user will be displayed 2 times in chat list .. sometimes if u want to post a story the screen jst freezes at loading.... If u open a post shared in chat and come back to msg , the msg option is gone...( Really sucks )",1
"Uninstalled. Between the ridiculous ads constantly thrown at you, the autoplay which you can't disable, the inability to mute, and the sluggishness of the app itself, the user experience is terrible. You will constantly miss posts on the main page and see ""you're all caught up"" after a couple stories (and the ads between them), forcing you to view your followed pages to actually see the stories you've missed. It seems Facebook (now Meta I guess) is determined to kill the platform entirely.",1
"I can't understand what's happening with my account I can't delete the chats I have updated my Instagram but still I can't even reply the text my other friends account I logged and the account is working properly only my account is not working. I have reported the bug problem 2-3 times but still no respond . So, please I request to solve this issue as soon as possible . Over past 1 year iam facing these problem .",1
"From the last 1 month the dms are not working , you have to refresh it and refresh it just to receive a massage and most importantly I had deleted a story and after 3 days I decided to restore the story but after restoring it , it didn shown up in the archive which made me worry and after that I couldn't even open the recently deleted section.. do something about it",1
"FIX THIS !!! Seems like im not the only one experiencing this issue. App no longer loads when I open the app... it just gives me a blank screen. I've Uninstalled and reinstalled it, I cleared the cache, cleared the data, enabled all permissions, restarted my phone, updated my phone...and nothing. For months I have not been able to use the app... I can only use the web version in a browser.",1
I've had my main account since about 2019 and what I've realized is that it gets all the latest updates WAY after everyone else ik does. I have 2 different spam accounts and a group account that were made not too long ago the oldest one is about 1 year old. All those accounts get updated with everyone else but my main doesn't?? It's frustrating. First the story likes (i got it TWO months after everyone) then the story reply stickers(I CAN'T REPLY TO THEM) now the notes? Fix this please.üßç,1
App has been much slower since the latest update. Everything takes forever to load. It's been nightmare. Not too sure whether the new update was there to fix bugs or introduce them. This has never happened before. I've deleted and reinstalled the app several times and the issue continues. Thought I was the only user but several of the recent reviews Ive read reflect the same issue.,1
"You can't pause reels,save pictures and videos but they keep bringing updates are not useful. It consumes a lot of data and it keeps hanging.",1
After updating the problems seem worst can't find my chats with my friend and can't seems to search for their account whereas the app in my other phone can see it ! Why! There seems to be other problems too.,1
"Totally incorrectly working As is filter my followers in latest sorting type it will show the same and also for the earlier one, Don't know how it's not working correctly, I also tried for uninstalling and installing app twice but it won't work.",1
"Tooo much bugs Can't refresh my following list by latest or earliest it only shows default one On the other side when in dm, in the past I can see by swiping left to saw at what time message is sent or received,now it's not working now when I swipe left it shows a different screen.Please fix the bugs.",1
What the hell problem sir why you guys don't allow our reel to public no one view i am trying again and again how much reel i uploaded but not one video got much view then what the hell the use of this app very disappointed. The content is good then also the management was not publishing the reel to public if you guys do this then no one will use insta you guys only support high users not like us very very bad experience üíî ram_11_44,1
"Keeps signing out smh. The WISH app has a higher rating. Tht should say alot! Algorithm not set to ur preferences/likes anymore. This app is NOT about the user's comfort now; solely money. Double tap to switch profiles? Horrible features. No matter how many bells & whistles you all think of, ppl just want to like and post. The nerve of you all to take that desire and squeeze it into a corner for ur financial gain. Forcing ppl to see political and vaccine news. Wheres the next big app...",1
"Don't get IG at all and only signed up as was FORCED TO in order to see pages of businesses I follow, and that's only reason I keep it. Constantly badgers me with notifications that random strangers like my story but I see no details in the app. Turned all notifications off. Suggestions take up my page, NOT the ppl I actually follow and they're often offensive or stupid. Uses tremendous amount of battery so I have it disabled until I have to use it. Their whole ethos is repugnant imo, I hate IG.",1
Worst behaviour recently and i have been facing lot of issues with this app. My network is working perfectly but when i open this app it can't load anything at all it stuck as it is and i have uninstalled and reinstalled it but still it stays the same and i hope you solve this isse ASAP,1
The notes feature is Very annoying and now team Instagram had make it larger in size so now it had bring me here. Request to remove that feature and it's not usefull also i think soo. Take some actions towards it. Thanks,1
"If there were zero star option, I would've chosen it. This bloody goddamn app, has suspended my 3 accounts for no reason. I had lots of data and connections in this account, and your foolishness has made me lose all of it. If you cannot manage multiple apps at once, just shutdown your damn company. Give me my all 3 accounts as soon as possible",1
The app experience went from amazing to the worst ever. They won't stop their stupid suggested accounts which is making the experience horrible on top of that the design is so bad. Stop trying to copy others and be you. No wonder less and less people using this app now... after all this years time for me to remove instagram,1
After the recent update.my insta feed is not refreshing..showing same post from at least 1 week. Also new message shows up after 5-6 hours..i have to keep on clearing catch of the app..multiple times..just to get message on time..developers should look after this..its just very annoying üòë,1
"So recently, i lost access to my old account and am having absolutely no help trying to get it back. I have been locked out due to double authentication. No one is helping. Plus the app keeps on crashing. What is actually going on instagram??",1
"My account account has been hacked and I can't follow the procedures to reset with a link. The cell number and the email that show to me on the page (as the image attachments) belongs to me but, I've never received any email to confirmation my identity as a selfie confirmation. I read about the options in the help center but I never find the option to get a selfie and confirm that it's my trying to access my account.",1
"My newsfeed hasn't refreshed in almost 5 days. Even when I try to refresh it myself. I uninstalled & reinstalled & it's still stuck on the same stupid videos. The number of fake people & their fake profiles is overwhelming, often get scam messages",1
It's a good platform. But the app needs improvement. So many bugs to fix. Very slow working and some functions are not working properly.,1
Stop showing me posts from 2 weeks ago in my feed. This is multiple posts from a few days ago or a week or 2 weeks ago. This never usually happens as before posts would appear on my feed less than a day ago. Fix this because it is really annoying. I don't want to see things that happens 2 weeks ago.,1
awful app designed to prey on your attention span to sell data to advertisers. every UI update randomly shuffles all the buttons around to give the impression that people are still working on improving the app. also imagine being a photo sharing program and then compressing every photo sent in DMs to like 144p lol. truly a capitalist ad-riddled hellscape.,1
"Since the recent update, image and video stretching is now an issue. If you film horizontally like a normal human then viewing it through the gallery looks terrible. The app still works though which is why this only goes down to 2 stars. *Edit* Video compatibility and image stretching is worse than I thought. In terms of user interface they've gone in a very TikTok direction. Reduced review to 1 star.",1
"Having quite bad experience and going to uninstall if my problem is not resolved. I am using Instagram for a long time but I am having issue that my number of followers are showing same since a long time. I want to tell the developer team if this issue is not resolved I am going to uninstall the Instagram app. Kindly resolve the issue as soon as possible. Although I am very popular in terms of instagram reels, My followers are complaining that they are following me but It is not showing",1
"This is the worst social media app out there! Will not allow you to swap pictures out that have been hidden to a certain country (UK), so messes up the whole grid. The only way to rearrange your grid is to delete your whole grid and re-upload! However, when I've tried to do that, the uploads are all messed up still and are all over the place! This app is awful! So frustrating! Have spent hours and hours trying to work this out! Think I might just have to delete my account and go elsewhere!",1
"I am starting to hate this app, everytime I go in its automatically changes reel/stories while in in the middle of watching, then I can't find it & at times theres just a blank screen where I have to close & open app again. You suck at this Mark Zuckerberg..üñï",1
App stops working suddenly without any reason. I have brand new mobile there us no problem with any other app and most of them are bigger than Instagram. I have ton of ram and internal memory free but still it's misbehaving.,1
i have more than one account on instagram and depending on the one that im on it shows me different versions of instagram. my main is a more older version while on my other ones its a newer version of instagram. i am not signed up for beta so im not sure why this js occuring. I'm also having trouble with using the drawing tool on my main account when i want to repost a post as well as the add your option on stories. but when i go to my other accounts these work perfectly fine. pls fix this asap,1
"Phones with android version 4. 4. 4 don't have limited access to most features that instagram installed on phones with android version 5 + which not only I but other user with the same Android version find very frustrating because of the following reasons No. 1 Old instagram home page No. 2 No black theme No. 3 Not being able to share stories There are more but I am unable to mention all Please try fix this, it will help the rest of people and will get more download for low end phones.",1
You see only two old posts from people you follow then the rest you see these days are just ads; and there's no way to control it. This app has gone downhill. You can refresh or manually hide ads one by one all year but it's all ads and promotions. Twitter makes more sense now.,1
"It used to be an app that felt personal, but they're now committed into converting it into a tiktok 2.0, which is exactly the opposite of what the users want. Give us back feeds filled with our friends posts, not ads, suggestions, or video clips. Keep the exploratory features to the explore tab, keep it out of our main feed.",1
"Facing login issue since last 7 days, i am not able to login into my account even by giving correct credentials, anyhow i tried to reset the password, it keep sending notification ""please wait a minute before trying again"" i mean what is this ? Please have a look at your login scenario. Thanks",1
recent update feels so clunky and I can't read comments on any post any more. also my keyboard glitches to be invisible whenever I start typing meaning I can't respond to dms unless I reopen the app. this is currently at a worse state then 2015 Instagram on an iPod 4 it's embarrassing how garbage it has become.,1
Really not loving the suggested feed. Used to love how everytime something new was shown from the accounts that I follow. But it's just showing content that I don't want to see. Very poor experience I must say.,1
Cant cancel reel uploads. I dont want to upload reels at all. Shouldnt force this feature. Your not tiktok and you never will be. Wont stop suggesting people even after disabling. Keeps suggesting contacts even when disabled!!! Popup comments are annoying and in the way.,1
"1 star, instagram is very buggy now. I was in a groupchat with some friends. But for some reason i wasnt able to send messages to it anymore and i asked them to kick me out of the group so i could join back. Now it says im kicked out, but i cant delete chat because OF THE STUPID ""NETWORK REQUEST FAILED, PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER"" popping up every single time i try to delete it. Its been going on for a week. Instagram fix this now damnit",1
I am unable to access my archived stories and have reported the issue several times yet there hasn't been any improvement. The app crashes a lot and there are too many bugs.,1
Changes too often. A lot of times not for the better. There was a feature where you can view dissapearing messages you sent within 24 hours and even save them. It was useful to recover pictures you haven't saved in your gallery. There was nothing wrong with it yet it was removed. If it ain't broke don't fix it and this is a big example of that.,1
"People take things out of content all the time. social media is fleshly and keeps people away from each other. Interactions should be in person not thru a screen. Now it does help people keep in touch, but it took away the personal feelings and connections and replaced them with feelings that should of never happened",1
"Sudden suspension of account. No warnings given of violation, no knowledge of what the violation was. Followed the steps to retrieve it. Only led to a blank loading screen. Tried to report, however they asked to log back into the account I have no access to and verify that I'm writing in for a review. I don't understand how I'm expected to follow this set of instructions that don't make sense at all.",1
"One of the worst apps ever I've used. Banned my main account 7 times for no reason n then disabled my second account which was linked to the main one, when I requested a review,they didn't do nothing. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app to login again and they deleted my second account permanently!",1
"That you can't crop and frame your pics to your liking in 2020... Honestly. If one didn't ""have to"" have this app I never would. Update: the security and customer service, from an app this prominent, is shameful. Hacked account recovery nearly impossible, no live help.",1
"They need to bring back the photography on the platform and allow for high resolution. If I wanted TickTok videos, I'd go to TickTok. Is this tiktok or Instagram.",1
I literally hate the new update I can't save story it's annoying The song name and everything literally filling all space I can't able to see videos as before I'm very disappointed with the update the worst update it is,1
I am unable to log into my account. I thought I had forgotten the password so decided to get it changed but it is not sending the log in link to my email address,1
"I can't use my instagram app, I can only see a white screen. I watched all the videos on how to fix this issue but all of them still not working for me. I hope you can adress my problem, I'm very frustrated about this. Thankyou!",1
"can't I just give -1 star? why did this app still not fix when many people have giving bad rates because of the blank screen. I having a hard time also lol. It's happen not now but long ago, and I even keep reinstall not only that, I also restart my phone and my internet connection. PLEASE FIX IT QUICKLY!",1
App is not working properly lacking too much sometimes does not connect with internet and showing only buffering.,1
Today I experience A wost Bug it is very sad to see this type of bugs on Instagram I have been using it for many years but now it is worst üëéüëéüëé,1
The app gets hanged all the time. A number of new bugs starts intruding every time it's updated.,1
"Absolutely terrible. Since the update yesterday I can't upload more than one photo which is pointless for my business account. Also I have no idea about these reels, loads of views one minute, zero the next. Go back to your roots Instagram and be photo based.",1
"So if someone was to hack your account and steal it, there's absolutely no way to get it back. There's not even a report button for a hacked account so you just loose everything personal. I've noticed they have been hacking accounts and selling them so someone can have more base followers. I know so many people that this is happening to currently.",1
Most glitchy app I've ever used and too many ads after every single post! This app is dead.,1
The chat box dont showing the history that I have chatted with other and Messages are not being sent even though there wasn't any Wi-Fi problems,1
"Reels suddenly stopped working. The button sometimes show but I get an error screen when pressing it. I have reported the problem 3 times in the last 2 weeks, but no response!",1
Instagram has been giving me a lot of problems I'm not able to see my profile ntg please see that u fix this problem right away cause I am not able to use the app properly.,1
"How is it that I'm following well over 100 people, who when I actively search them I can see are posting, but my normal timeline is ONLY ""suggested posts"" and ads? And legitimately 90% of the suggested posts are complete trash of no interest to me or what I follow?",1
Y'all need to stop updating this app. Every time you do it starts glitching really bad. When I tried to view people's stories it won't let me view the whole thing it just skips it and closes out,1
too many ads. Pushing stupid reel videos of people I don't follow. Promotes hate and division. Reporting system is broken. Trying too hard to be tictoc. Meta sucks,1
"This latest version of instagram is terrible , buggy . I am not able to follow people on Instagram from last 5-6 days and I've reported this issue like 100 times but no response no solution. When new people follow me but it shows same amount of followers i had before , this is so frustrating, it's been really tough to use instagram, i don't like it .",1
Im unable to download my own posts on my device. The app asks for storage permission but there is No option to choose from to give storage permission,1
I've tried a million times to update the app but it's not happening and because of that I can't collaborate with any of my friends.,1
I'm not able to upload posts. Instagram crashes whenever I try to do so. Really pissed off by this !,1
"This app worked great until it stopped allowing me to follow anyone back. It does not save my follow requests so I keep following back and it keeps erasing the follow request. This is super annoying because my friends think I'm a jerk for not following them back. Definitely would like to get this fixed. Updated, I googled why I wasn't able to follow people it said I exceeded the follower amount set, so I started unfollowing accounts then my account got suspended for being suspected spam. üôÉ",1
The new update is terrible. I can't even post now. All the recent pictures are gone. Its not even working properly. The automatically close on its own when I'm watching anying. The creator should solve this problem quickly,1
"Having so much trouble with app , especially when go to log in and it won't do it . Have unstalled and reinstalled app on a no of occasions and still doesn't let me log in. When I'm able to it's fine , until I try again later in day again to go back on it doesn't. Get it sorted out please ,",1
"I really like this app, is one of my favorites social media. But since yesterday it started crashing, I open the app and like 2 seconds later it closes and pops up an error window.",1
"""Sorry there was a problem with your reuqest"" Cannot login on and on, even try another way to login such as (link email, sms, facebook, and verification face and get 8 code from email). I really don't understand is this bug and not supported some device or what? I'm searching keyword #instagramdown #instagramerror and the result there are many people have issue like this.. Please give us answer/update..",1
Instagram team is Careless about users problem.i report my notes(new update) problem for more than 10 times but team didn't solve problem or gave me that update.,1
"2nd instagram account because, I got hacked and Instagram sided with hacker because I didnt have enough selfies to prove it was me and now locked out of primary account. Where I had business going through.",1
Suddenly I stopped seeing comments under a thread. So if I go to comment section I'll see the originsl comment but won't see any of the replies. I get notifications of people replying to my comments but when it redirects me to the comment I don't see the replies. And also not seeing replies for any posts at all. I tried updating but still won't fix it.,1
"Hi Everyone. Very bad experience with Instagram while my update insta application my account is suspended. Without any reason and without intimate i break any guidelines, before Is better i used YouTube. They give me waring if i not follow YouTube rules. Worst insta application. My ID luckyharinde account had suspended. Very bad .",1
This app ain't good enough You can't message people again Ain't showing where to write your message only the follow button without the message space,1
"My account was locked and never received the authentication code to unlock it via email, I've changed my number on my account multiple times but it shows the old one so unfortunately you guys have failed. There's no help only pages of information that doesn't assist in resolving the problem now I'm stuck losing all my contacts messages and everything because of no assistance I've been stressed since I was locked out of my account",1
"The new update is terrible. Making stories is so much worse now, and i hate the new UI for video calls. Its so clunky and obstructs everything, and I just want it to go back to the way it was before. Update: it's still terrible and somehow got even worse.",1
After a update there is many bugs when I open insta that this app glitch for 15 to 20 minutes and when I go to someone profile and watch his/her reel that insta open any other reel instead of this reel,1
Many bugs .I'm not open my account.when i try open it Instagram give notification that we couldn't send a link to ur device it's poor facilities,1
They locked my account temporarily and Now I am not able log in back because they are sending the 6 digit code on the phone number or email i.e too old and I don't have access to that. I can't report it because they say your account is activated not disabled. My Instagram is linked with my facebook account and I also have access to that but their is no option to open it using Facebook.,1
Automatically imported my birthday from Facebook. Instagram used to be the better option but not anymore.,1
The mesages will not go to another people even if my net is tooo fast and it takes a lot of time to send a message and now the message notifications are getting very late,1
"Why doesn't the translation feature work? How am I supposed to understand what Gong Yoo is typing??? Nothing is loading, and Instagram is way too glitchy it never notifies me whenever anyone leaves a ‚ô•Ô∏è or if anyone I really want to keep up to date with has posted photos or anything on their stories! Please just regress back to how this app used to be! Whatever you're doing right now is not working! If it weren't for my overseas friends or Going Yoo I would've uninstalled this app long ago!",1

"Blank screen for few days when I tried to open the app in my phone 1. The worst part is I tied my account with the 2 steps verifications in phone 1, so I couldn't log in my acc on another phone because it needs the phone 1 to approve with the verification. I tried to reinstalled so many times, I even updated my phone system to the latest version, same problem exists. I couldn't use my insta at all. Please fix this issue.",1
My app was crashing earlier so I uninstalled and reinstalled and when I open I only get a white screen! ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è what's going on. Ig works from my browser but not from the app. What do I need to do next? UPDATE: Over a week later and my app still doesn't work!!,1
"Sir,  I am using instagram android application for last 1 year. But I can't reply to any specific messages because swipe and reply option is not available for me. It's very disappointing. I had reported the same to instagram support team more than 3 times, but there is no response from them. What can I do ? Are you treating all customers like this ? Why your team is not responding? Terrible!",1
the instagram algorithm is now unclear. the timeline is so messy. irregular. very very uncomfortable. trash app,1
"This app is a bot infested mess. A stingy algorithm that ensures your posts don't get seen even by your friends or followers. If you're lucky they'll show up days later. Showing you posts from to 2 or 3 days ago, seeing the same pages you follow all the time. This app is a mess and relies on you paying to boost your posts. Shite.",1
As a photographer I'm slowly moving back to Vero. I can't even Boost my posts anymore. Don't know why or how. I've tried 2 different debit cards and three credit cards...still nothing has changed. I've asked Instagram if I've been blocked or have a strike and apparently it's neither of them. Only recently I've discovered that you can also promote your Instagram posts on Facebook Ads Manager so I've been doing that but I prefer using Instagrams ads manager instead. I dont know...it's a shame,1
"What is going on with clickable external links? For several days I am not able to click on or open any links in either profile bios or in stories. Did I change a setting or is there another issue? Tried uninstall and updates, but nothing works. Very annoying.",1
"I honestly don't like at all what you've become. I don't want your brainless stories. For every 10 post, 5 are suggestions and ads, some videos and a few are what I really follow. If I wanted to use TikTok, I would use TikTok, you are just running something that was perfect.",1
I can't find the music option in my Instagram. i have also updated instagram and i have done whatever is possible but music option is not coming please help,1
"I've been using this app for more than 6 years and in this time line, all of my accounts got banned for no reason and the support is so much bad, they don't help at all.",1
"FIX IT! Every time I open the app, the feed refreshes AS IM LOOKING at a post. Then the post isn't in the feed anymore and I have to go to that person's page to finish reading their post. They destroyed the feed.",1
It's really irritating that it refreshes the page when you out of the app for just 2 seconds.,1
The app is not working to me I tried many times but it is the same I reset my phone and it is not working I think it have a problem,1
I'm not able to see the post of all the people who I follow on insta only the few specific post are visible to me i needed it to be rectified or any way to help me with this issue bcz posts r not visible even if I'm following them,1
I can't make and post reels any more. Please fix this problem since reels are very important for our small business.,1
I'm facing a problem from being a long time around 3 to 4 days my Instagram app is not working properly when I click on reels they are not opening if someone send me a message they are also not opening if I want to send message someone a it failed and if I want to add a story and it also failed so it totally means the Instagram app is having lots of bugs not working properly for me at least hope they fix and reply my problem as I need help from their side.,1
I think Instagram is really important for those person who cannot do our work and they just waste valueable time on this platform so it very bad app for young generation,1
"Dunno what happened to Instagram. It has been days or week, I guess, since Instagram, really dont know happened, but I guess there is a bug issues. Pictures, posts, stories, and even reels keep on loading and/or not showing the reason why I wasn't be able to use Instagram properly. I thought it's just because of the internet or my phone but It turned out, it wasn't.So please fix this issue as soon as possible. Thank You!",1
"From last some days I'm facing many issues like Rply and react option not coming in chat, Hindi songs and local songs not coming in story section nd many more bugs. Pls fix",1
"Before, I had no problems with Instagram. No bugs or anything. But when I went to try to add another account, instagram refused to take me to the sign up page. It just froze, so I tried signing out of all of my accounts and to my surprise, it just totally crashed. I tried to restart my phone and unreasonable amount of times, and even uninstall it a few times. And it still won't open. It's just a blank page.",1
"I can't even say the word 'idiot' without the threat of getting your account deleted :( that makes me sad. And also the reels are terrible, I don't know why instagram is trying to be tiktok.",1
Lost access to my account during a phone upgrade (lost all authenticator data) no way to contact IG directly - no help pages for such an issue. No assistance available. Guess it's as good a time as any to just stop using it.,1
"Earlier the new version of Instagram used to run in my phone, but now suddenly its old version has started coming, which is also not getting updated.",1
"It's literally so buggy. I've been using this app since 2017, but these days, as an anroid user, it's just horrible. I can't send messages sometimes, I can't open photos or listen to voice messages. 1/ 5",1
"Continues to crash, business location has stopped working. All help reports have been ignored!",1
Application shows unknown error message and took me out of the app when trying to post. I tried closing the app completely and updating and still nothing. The app won't open for a while after receiving the error message as well.,1
My friend sent photo in WhatsApp and asked to sent back that photo in Instagram.After I sent that photo my Instagram message box was blocked.its saying that i violate the guidelines of instagram.this is not good . that's why I am giving 1 star for you,1
I can't able to swipe the messages and reply it accordingly nt even hving the react option except like option. Definitely not like the messenger of the app,1
"This is getting so annoying my Instagram have not been working properly recently and this is not the first time .It have happened more then 3 time. Nothing works and i can't even open the app. The feed,reel and messages are not working .so kindly look into it",1
"Just awful these days. Stop trying to be TikTok! No one sees your photos, full of intrusive nonsense videos of strangers. Majority of the videos suggested for me are other people's babies/children which I have absolutely no interest in. Lots of bots that look at your stories and nothing is done about fake profiles. I wish Instagram was how it used to be, for photos. Or it could at least be a nice mix of vids/reels and photos instead",1
"It's all money now for Instagram. It has features of an online shop and a TikTok-esque sht now. I miss the 2014 era of Instagram. Just pure photos and videos, nothing else. Plus it crashes a lot lately. Really disappointed.",1
So much bugs in updated version. I can't send the message to any one and even I can't share the post with any one. It's so annoying. Even DM section is entirely wipe out even earlier conversation and dms I can't fine it. Need urgent help in this,1
"Instagram used to be a great resource for finding artists and was my preferred social media platform for socialising. Now I am permanently withdrawing from Instagram as there is no way to disable the reels feature. Instagram has lost its distinctive charm as a unique photo sharing app; it's now a cesspit of tiktoks that prioritises creators that post mindless, substandard content. If I wanted TikTok, I would download TikTok.",1
"Unstable, unreliable, and rather pointless; I essentially dump 1/2 the app 5 out of 7 days to get it to work-- EVERY BLOODY DAMNED DAY! I post the Word of God so no, it can't 'come back later,"" or ""choose another image!"" It works ssssllllloooowwwwlllyy for 3 days, then it dies or I simply must kill it to post Scriptures - REELS crashed everything, faster and more reliably, so great ID anything, moron idea. But I'll just allow the Word of God to be used in a profane manner?!? Men!!!",1
"so glitchy especially with messages. i have to reload messages to see new ones and when i do that a group chat that i'm in disappears and i have to search for it for it to reappear. i need this fixed asap, it makes messaging unenjoyable and instagram is the main app i use to message people.",1
"After reading other reviews I am happy I am not the only one experiencing the white screen of death. I haven't been able to use my Instagram for over 3 weeks now. I hate using the web browser , you are limited on features you could do on there. IG be better because the minute a new app comes up that is like IG you are going to lose a loyal supporter.",1
since the last update i cant stay on the app more than 5 seconds. i just wanted to upload a story but the second i click on the photo the app suddenly closes itself!!! please fix this! its annoying.,1
"Nice to use. But some audios delete automatically, and I am unable to download the video from story",1
"I've reinstalled this app and restart my phone countless times but what I found was a blank page after instagram's logo appeared, I even can't log in into my account and I think this app so useless. How can the newest version be like this? Please tell me what should I do? Please fix this problem as soon as possible, so I'll change this review",1
It used to be a good app and was easy to use now it only cares about reels and posting or editing a post is a pain.,1
"Instagram app keeps scrolling the stories of the people I follow itself. I do not scroll, Instagram keeps scrolling really fast.",1
Too many intrusive ads You have to swipe through at least 20 ads and irrelevant pages before you come across what is supposed to be one of your friends or followers post . I had to unfollow a lot of celebs and pages that I like just so I could see what my friends are posting. The ads are out of control it's abominable Fb is nearly dead and meta is break dancing on Instagram's grave before it falls apart because the devs are so out of touch.,1
"Hay dear Instagram team I have last 3 year Instagram experience mean since last 3 year and many time I get bugs and at the end your team find them and fix, my phone model number infinix hot 8 and few days I continually face a unique bug I describe about this bug when I turn live mode in my I'd and I saw my live section freezing like when run your algorithm picture in picture then freezing stop only one picture I hope insta team do her best as soon as possible thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"Literally everything getting worst in my account reel option is not showing ,music not showing to add in story, can't even refresh the feed and always showing this audio is not available in your region in every video fix it as soon as possible...",1
I don't usually open or use this app and I'm currently following 15 to 20 people or pages only and it caught my attention this morning that I'm already following 340 profiles. This app is crazy and creepy.,1
It has become so so so annoying to open the app. Hell lot of suggested posts. I am not able to see through the stories without getting add after every account. I can't bear this random posts on my feed also.,1
Now Instagram behaving so weird. I 've been waiting to deactivate my account for the last 1 hour but it isn‚Äôt working.üëç,1
The page goes blank once I upload the app. This happens to me July 29th. I haven't been able to use the app. I have Uninstall the app and reinstall it. Same issues.,1
"I can't post reels at all. And for some reason, I can look at people's posts, people's stories, post, or even search anything up! Everything's a white loading screen. I've uninstalled and reinstalled this app many times.",1
The current iteration is the absolute best revenue generator there is out there. There are two ratings for this review. The first and most important is the rating for the adverts. I can't abide them so 0 stars. As for the almost pointless rating for usability. 1 because I managed to open it and flick upward ok. That caused me to delete it again. Its worse than the last time I tried it. Sorry.,1
"Have only been having issues with this app lately. Reels just pause at random times and won't continue playing, when uploading Reels the text field moves halfway across the screen, different music than I chose is being played or two songs are randomly combined (even though they aren't in the original audio). Also when saving Reels it seems like every possible thing has changed to what it looked like originally. It's not just a hassle to post content, it's impossible",1
"The app used to be great. Still photographs are where it's at. It let's you actually appreciate the moments your friends have captured. It's was acceptable with the amount of ads, but now with the huge video push to try to become ticktok it's now intolerable, and deleted from my phone. It's still OK on a web browser where it can prevent video from running but otherwise like watching ads at the theater before a show ü§Ø",1
It is been almost a month as my Instagram account is not opening as while opening Instagram blank white page is coming. Whereas Instagram lite is working fine but there I had to download everything. Please resolve this issue as tried everything from my end.,1
Every time i open the app .have to refresh the chats to appear and it takes almost 10 secs to refresh so annoying.,1
Ads are totally irrelevant. Full of irrelevant posts and reels. Chat section is totally feels glitchy. Poor messaging experience. Video calls also bad. And too many glitches after the last update.,1
"IG app is trash, i don't need my feed immediately refreshed when openimg the app or when returning to it after a few mims, juat stop trying to up your stats.",1
Been facing a problem of false screenshot notification send to the other person on one time view or view again photos or videos where I haven't even taken any screenshots. Its so annoying and scary for both the person. Hope it get cleared.,1
"Crashing like crazy! Can't keep the app open for longer than 2 seconds. Tried restarting my phone, deleting the app and reinstalling it and it's still crashing.",1
Having a great experience lately but it is more than half an hour I am trying to upload reel but it seems irritating now. It feels like there are many bugs to be fixed. Kindly look after it.,1

Moreover, if I am tagging anyone on my stories they are not able to repost/reshare it. Why is this happening and after soo complaint why any solution is not yet provided.",1
Carousel always stuck on the 1st picture when editing. It all began since the latest version.,1
Idk what's happening with Instagram lately. Too many updates and too many glitches. My messages are not properly loading after the Update with Notes (which was completely unnecessary feature btw). Also when i click on a group its not loading the members properly and if i click on a particular profile from the group its taking too long to load or doesn't load at all. Please fix all of these. It's annoying,1
Now a days from last month its getting problem for messages and story putting and all. Settings has bern came new but its not good. Before was better then now,1
"Haven't been able to open in months. I've Uninstalled, reinstalled and updated the app; nothing changed. There's a blank white screen when opening and occasionally says error uccuredbut nothing else.",1

I rested my phone but It's showing only blank screen every time. Please fixed my issue. I m facing this issue since 1st of August now today it's 5th of August.,1
Dogshit. It barely even works anymore. No reason. Just stops. Everyone I know says it happens to them during the same time. Billions for an app that cannot work properly. I hope ad companies take note in money they've wasted on advertising to a platform that hardly works.,1
Problem with logging in. App says my account username doesnt exist yet there is no problem with logging in on chrome or other browsers.,1
Only reason for dissatisfaction is the security issues. Lately so many Instagram accounts are being hacked.,1
"I have used Instagram business account for my business page. But it have so many glitches. Atleast you guys should provide a help contact through mail. There is no way to contact Instagram. Simply the answer is report it on app. Am also doing that , in past one month , i have raised nearly 5 to 6 bugs. Still didnt get fixed or get any response also.. And finally now , i promote my own video in insta ad itself , by my own money. Likes & views not reflecting on my profile, in notification its thr",1
My Instagram app is not working and I'm very disappoint with this. When I open Instagram to use it didn't open and show only white screen... Very poor experience.. If Instagram can fix this problem please let me know otherwise I just say goodbye to Instagram forever. Thank you,1
My insta acc has automatically gone disabled. My lawyer had gone through all the Instagram's terms and services and claim that I've not violated any of it. Please reactivate my account,1
"Shadowban after shadowban, I tried to figure out why but I get nothing and they won't tell you. I took screenshots of my engagement before this started and after. This is killing my small business! I don't care what Instagram or Facebook spouts off about supporting small, they really don't. I'm disabled this is all I have!",1
Hi. My account Wybie_Lovat097 has been disabled for NO REASON. I hsve not violated the guilides they claimed!! My last account was hacked and instagram did nothing in helping me get it back!!

"In less than a year of using app, I have had to uninstall and reinstall 4 times. Twice in last week. Music to reels breaks A LOT and often there's just static. Oh an no help from IG.",1
Worst app in responding to users report does not consider problem on time poor management truly disappointed it was the app which I use the most but today I m really disappointed with the bugs and their respond to it YouTube immediately respond the problem and resolve it,1
"If you ever get hacked on Instagram, know that Instagram won't really help you. My old account got hacked since 4th of July, I tried everything in order to recover it, and then I created a new one, in order to report this problem with my new account. The support email address doesn't work anymore and if you try to send anything there it just sends an auto reply which tells you to visit help center. You're the worst of the worst",1
Video call quality is too low. And chating system should be improve . Sometimes i sent massage others but the massage sent is late.,1
Videos are loading ungodly slow and it's not my internet. Videos load fine on fb and my husband's Instagram has been slow for him too.,1
Am trying to log into my account but it has failed it keeps on stopping..I have tried to sign up but it's still doing the same ...can u help me,1
This app has currently removed my account @lipii_verma for no literal reason. Very bad experience please help me to get back with my account this glitch is so irritating and irrelevant.,1
Instagram app bricked my phone and then i was trying to unlock or switch it off it thought my pushing the unlock button a series of times was an SOS call and my phone phoned the police.,1
"Sucks your Internet, full of glitch and could have more ways to improve like on how to post or smoother ways to edit reels than having to trial and error over some basic thing. Posted an art and then my comment got removed because I posted it 3 times in a row, reported the bug, my bug can't be reported. Instagram please. Bots are doing better than me.",1
"Pretty much garbage lately! I pre edit my pics and videos with another app before uploading them to IG and the app reverts them to original format without the editing. Big tech is garbage right now that doesn't care about providing quality products, rather only their profit margins! Months later-IG asked me to rate this app. Still trash! And months later -asked again, possibly worse! More bugs than ever! I've reported so many issues, yet no changes, no problems resolved, no response. Do ur job!",1
"App doesn't work at all. Whenever i open the app, black screen pops up and doesnt work. Reinstalled this app so many times since yesterday, but still doesn't work at all.",1

"just tryed to join beta (i like beta and nightly versions), updated the app and continue to use it as usual. in my country instagram is blocked by government, so i have to use tor or vpn to circumvents censorship and know the truth, so my connection is constantly unstable and from time to time i need to reconnect tor to select another not blocked bridges bc i can't connect to tor directly. i started to see some errors like ""message status fail"" and at the end Meta just have suspended my account",1
"So disappointing, recently this app is acting funny, one min everything functions then next stories and posts won't load. I can't even log out it seems it just keeps spinning.

And zero customer services, meanwhile their twitter is full of how awesome they are Really frustrating.",1
"After the latest update, getting worse. Can't load the picture or anything at homepage. Uninstalled & installed many times but nothing change. Keep loading for ages.. Not useful at all. Don't update if your current version doesn't hv any prob",1
"Am unable to use the ""Add Yours"" sticker on one of my accounts. I'm not able to make my own or use other people's. I've tried the online fixes and nothing I've found works. Instagram doesn't respond to their support lines as I have tried to get a response for weeks now and have gotten nothing",1
"Won't work keeps closing had to uninstall and Reinstall twice so far... won't let me pay certain feed, stories, reels...",1
Worst app . It deleted my draft videos automatically even without logging out or uninstalled it. There are lots of issue after updating the new version . I want my videos back they are really meant to me.,1

There is no option to delete the other people's selective messages. We can only delete whole conversation. Please develop this option,1
Since the last update this app closes down repeatedly. Even when im not using the app a notice pops up every 5 minutes to tell me it has shut down again. What a shame.. Its one of my favorite apps.,1

My account has been disabled for not providing date of birth. And there is no way to recover it even if i am willing to provide photo ID. It's impossible to verify ID once account has been disabled. Then how should my account can be accessed. When trying to login the user ID doesn't exist. No visible remedy for the issues. Very disappointed.,1
"Update 28 Jul -since posting 1 Apr that my reels stopped working overnight and crash every time I attempt to post, it's still happening, 4 months on. Its ridiculous! I haven't posted a single reel.

Also my account is open profile. Worried that my photos and videos will be misused.,1

App interface is good and I can say the worst thing I have seen is backup of chats...i accidentally deleted a chat and try to download the data...which doesn't give the back up of deleted chats...worst experience I have seen that they don't provide customer care...even if I sent a mail to them and can't reply to that mail...they will send other mail and solve your issue using this link....It's better to give the option of backup of deleted chats and customer care for us...it will be useful to us,1
"Too much lagging buffering, pausing. Glitching an having to restart the app. It's for photos an videos but you sometimes have the hardest time posting an trying to edit that",1
App won't let me report a scammer!! The App still wont let me see the profiles of people who request to follow me. Apparently nobody is intelligent to figure this out in the instagram development department.,1
"PROBLEMS PROBLEM PROBLEMS. ESPECIALLY WITH REELS. PICKED 1 SONG BUT IT'S PLAYING ANOTHER. BUT MEANWHILE. YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM WHERE IT TELLS YOU WHAT SONG IT IS, AND THE SONG TITLE IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU HEAR AS WELL. SMH",1

I am not getting the messaging update and i am not able see my comments that i have posted earlier.i have also reported about it so many times before but sadly nothing happenedüòî. Instagram doesn't care about it's users anymore.so now i am just gonna delete this cringe app üò§.,1
"it's worst to my instagram account already blocked ten days, I appeal, report, feedback and also email to instagram still havent can't get it back. Please unblock my account I very want it back becoz it's around ten years memories insideü•∫",1
What is happening with Instagram? I uninstalled it by mistake after that I have installed it like 15 times and every time what i see is a white screen. I tried every possible way to open it.... But it is stuck. Idk what's happening with this app. I'm extremely pissed. Do something about it.,1
"For a full day, almost two now, Instagram is frozen. It won't refresh on my phone. I've done all the usual troubleshooting... twice... and it's just useless. What's going on?",1
"Since the most recent update, you can't access your gallery to upload photos, it only shows previously uploaded pictures. So frustrating for someone trying to use this for business purposes!",1
"Again and again old insta shows up even after updating nothing happens, i have to reinstall the app to fix it, very annoying",1
"Unfortunately, the original software has encountered a problem and cannot be entered into the profile. The login page to the profile doesn't load and it constantly warns that something went wrong and hangs in the language startup section. Please take care of this matter immediately",1
Somehow the people behind this app make it worse and worse with each update constantly disconnected from their primary userbase because they're trying to compete with tiktok even though this is a photo sharing app at the end of the day. Get your heads out of the gutter.,1
There should be some improvement at chat section. Whether try to save my story it's saving without music.,1
"Really bad experience. For the last 4 to 5 weeks can log in whenever tries to open the app it shows white screen and is stuck there. Don't know why? Tried clearing up cache n storage in setting, force stop n all but not solved yet.",1
"Horrific for customer support. Zero ways to contact regarding a log in issue that is not listed in the help pages. Every solution offered is circular. No email, chat or any other support. Impossible to access my account despite having full access to the linked Facebook, email and phone numbers. Help pages lead to dead and empty links",1
All else aside and above and beyond anything else this app is an indisputable detriment to society. We would all be better off if it was eliminated. But as with any Pandora's box there's little chance this one is going to put itself away.,1
"Worked great up until the last update 2 days ago. Now it won't even open, click on the app, load for a sec then close. Losing content time. I've uninstalled and reinstalled.... Thanks for screwing it up on this last update.",1
It's been awhile since I've been on Instagram and I've been trying to send messages to a close friend of mine but the accept button WILL NOT WORK. I've been trying for over an hour please fix this app nothing works.,1
"I haven't been able to post in over a wk....it's just a black screen. I've updated it, turned phone on & off, shut off the app & nothing is working. I've made a complaint a wk or more ago & still hasn't been fixed!",1
My experience was terrible i used to be able to stay on a call when i get out of the app but now with the new update i can't that's a bummer really.. i though updates go for the better not for worst !!!! .. i give it 1 star and it's too much hopeu fix this issue cause I'm frustrated.,1
"I had no issues with this app until a few weeks ago. Every time I try opening it, I just get a black screen. I've un-installed it and re-installed, cleared the cache and restarted my phone and it still doesn't work.",1
"Doesn't access all the photos from my photo gallery, in any album or location I can find. This is a new problem",1
"Very bad when the I'd is hacked owner is not able to recover it,,, if the I'd is hacked then the password nd all are also changed by the hacker so why previous password is required,, before the selfi video option. Plz Insta remove the previous password option selfi video is a good option to recover,,, iam continuously trying but my previous year passwords are not recognised the app and I lost all the modes only last option selfivideo is only option to recover my account... Plz help",1
My Instagram is not working properly and not refreshing properly . I tried many time to refresh properly but it's not working and also reinstall Instagram but the bugs is not clear,1
Unable to access my account. What the hell is happening and if its not confirmed then you guys will disable my account permenantly. No cooperation from instagram team. Really dissappointed.,1
"From a few months, my Insta is not at all working. Whenever I try opening, it only shows a white blank screen and nothing really comes. I'm using Instagram Lite but dosen't have any good features. Please update.",1
Videos and pictures freeze all the times. Prolong downloads. Very frustrating that I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling. Whatever happened to the Instagram we use to have and knowüòå.,1
This is a nice app but recently the lags are just too much! You can't even post a story! It keeps loading but it doesn't post! I've even waited for half an hour but still it's just the same. It happenes every single time!!!,1

Any type of features are not provided in my Instagram account.....no any reactions in my chat box ..... too many time I reported my problems but it doesn't matter to them....they are not solving my problems. üò°,1
I can't report my problem.... Where as it says can't create a bug report right now. Sorry My Instagram is not getting update properly even after updating,1
"I recorded a video with sound, my friend uploaded it on his account, I am getting a notification that instagram music is not available in my region. We are sitting next to each other, he can play it I cannot. I hate robot discrimination by apps. The solempurpose of this app is to share a moment. This is not it.",1
"Texts are not editable! It's not none English typing friendly! Crops photos! You can't pause, forward or backward videos! Can't reply to messages by mentioning! Can't copy texts, even you comment!",1
My account keeps logging out when I try to login it keeps showing error and I can't login in? This has happened several times please fix this,1
"I can't open the Instagram app for a while after I updated it. every time I open it, it only lasts a few seconds then after that it returns to my phone's main page. I hope this problem can be resolved quickly.",1
At first the app experience was really great but later on all the reel videos were crashing and in the message section I was only able to like and reply but all of my friends were able to reply with emojis.I have raised bug report for this still no response.,1
"Edit 8/13/22: Meh, even after the most recent update, it is still showing up as a blank screen. Can't login because a blank screen appears when I click on the app on my phone.",1
I have been facing a problem from a month by now. I can't see the DMs coming only notifications can be seen,1
"Posts not loading, not able to post stories as well, have tried uninstalling installing, it works for a few minutes then again it does the same thing. What kind of update is this ? Device : OnePlus 7 Update : the newest update didn't solve the issue, it still persists",1
Hey Instagram some small problem in this app A saved Audio page didn't work. immediately check the bugs solve......,1
i have reported many times but they didn't do any think.....i have an issue with messages..i cant react on them...it just gave ne an option (double tap to like)....reels are also not working....it gave an error... I've uodated my Instagram many time but always disappointed üíî,1
"Seriously Instagram ? ""NOTES"" this feature is trash. LEGIT TRASH, most people including me don't want to read others rubbish on top of their chat list. This is such a mood spoiler, i dont want to read other's cringe stuff! I don't want to read other's useless and senseless notes! I get it that It's just a new way to slide into others dms but seriously? NOTES? Instagram you're really getting off that classy wibe we love. Please i request you to remove this feature it's highly irritating.",1
"So get this, My main theme page was put on strike for a story that expired long ago(so weird) it showed the date I put up the story which was in June but they put me on strike a month afterwards and I didn't even save the story in my highlights. It was very odd and it kept showing the strike sign and I just decided to use my other accounts, IG better fix this cuz I have built so much on that page especially my community.",1
"It was fine for a while, but suddenly I can't reach the photos in my gallery to post them? Maybe it's the last update or maybe it's a bug, idk. But basically I can't post new photos with ease, the gallery only shows my previous insta photos and doesn't let me see new photos I've taken üôÉ",1
for about 2 days every time I open the app the screen is just blank. It's not my network since my other apps are working perfectly. I have restarted my phone and reinstalled the app multiple times! Please help!,1
"They're bombarding/imposing with ""suggested post"" or ""because you like a reel from this account"" on our feeds that are nothing by annoying and useless.",1
"I'm tired of all the ""reels"". Where are the things I like? Stop recommending BS to me, I really don't care what YOU think I LIKE. And for the love of God, stop putting all the popular pages first! I want to see new and upcoming photographers, not someone who has 70,000 likes for something absolutely stupid. I came back and built another page, but I'm contemplating deleting it again. There's no good content.",1
"Why even choosing to make a new post would i want my only options to be selecting the images from posts I've already made? Suddenly can no longer access videos on my phone at all and cannot access images in gallery, nor select multiple for a post. Whatever Meta update went in essentially makes this app completely useless from an Android",1
What is wrong with instagram ? I can't even view my feeds from yesterday. It only shows black screen and my story Icon. It doesn't even show other:s stories. Also no Dms are coming. If i login with another acc. It will work But with my own account. I doesn't work I use @bharatheshsk_13 acc now. It doesn't show any feeds or dms. It only shows some particular person's old msgs only when they send a MSG. It appears in DM Then when I open insta again after sometime it disappears Pls fix this,1

"Recently I can't see my friend list in latest, it only is default... no matter what I click.",1
Instagram is ruined by so many ads and the feed doesn't show you who you follow at all . Just a bunch of reels,1
"My main account was hacked, I've done all of the steps instagram has told me to do to get it back and they keep saying that they don't have enough evidence to prove its me. I've had that account probably since like 7th grade of course some of my pictures aren't going to add up not to mention the hacker changed it to a different Facebook page and Email, my numbers still attached though, to make things worse there customer service is basically nonexistent. Can I give no stars yet",1
Really not liking the update that has removed the ability to share public stories to Facebook or external apps. I used this quite a lot and there was no need to remove it. Stop trying to fix something that isn't broken.,1
Horrible and getting worse!! 11 hours later and I get notifications from shared posts that I've already seen. Or I get the same notifications 2-3 times. Every update is making this app worse. It's becoming more pointless then Facebook. If I just wanted videos I would watch YouTube!!,1
Very bad experience. I can't swipe reply to any message or react with different emojis to a particular message. Plus recently all of a sudden my Instagram got hanged and deleted all my drafts. You need to fix this ASAPüò£,1
Deleted the app for some reason and re-installed it. Now the app is not opening. My phone is Samsung M31s. 8 GB RAM and still insta is not loading. Tried with different internet options such as Wi-Fi and mobile data. Please help.,1

I've also requested so many times.. that please check there's some problem but .. still it is jot paying any attention. I'm really started hating this app,1
"It was fine until a few days ago. It won't let me switch accounts, I can't scroll threw my page, I can't text people, I get a notification if I get a text but I won't see it in the chat. I uninstalled it and reinstaled it and now it's all black",1
"GREAT JOB, INSTAGRAM!!!! With every subsequent update, you harm the excellent creatives I follow even more! Also, now many of the repected coaches and therapists I follow are being forced to do silly little dances in order to reach their audience! Even then, I cannot seem to find most of the posts from the folks I follow, except for posts I liked about a week ago that keep floating to the top of my feed. Oh, and yes, the first thing I want to see when I open the app is an AD--you got it!! A++",1

"This application has no support at all I reported for the same issue 4 times, everytime they fix it after taking 2-3 days the same issue appear the next time. I'm very disappointed with this app it has a lots of bugs and they take 2-3 days to fix it, their team is pretty slow at fixing things.",1
I am not able to recover my Instagram account as i lost my mobile phone and I was not able to recover Google authentication.. and it's asking for Google authentication code.. i try to connect with support but form support team.. not single person contact.. Which is not good at all.. You guys need to provide alternative for the same.. also you guys need to add support contact email and number to help the users like me..,1
It's a real bad experienced! It's always lagging on video call even though we have a good connection!,1

App does not open on my phone. Have to use web and can't connect wallet for digital collectibles. I only came back because I thought it would have improved by now. It hasn't.,1
"Worst website/app ever created. I use it only because other people do. It makes no sense that this exists and I wish it the worst fate. Youtube has videos... Instagram has instas, posts, stories, reels, highlights, dms, and a bunch of other incomprehensible garbage. If you make a good post you get 100 messages from ""galaries"" begging for money",1
Lots of bugs and they don't do there job to fix anything. Always down too! Notifications delete on there own. Terrible service. If there was a chance to give negative stars I would. Doesn't do there job. Pictures work not good anymore on stories. Haven't seen so many bugs in my life!!! Terrible employees!!! Reporting this business. New update sucks and the same company as Facebook. No wonder both apps are so bad just like the staff!!! Signing up for beta doesn't even work. Been waiting a hour!,1
"Can no longer see comment replies, and it's affecting all Android users it seems. You guys don't even bother to acknowledge and try to fix it. Pathetic.",1
It's a mall now. everything I view seems so controlled by algorithm I don't know why I bother.,1

It's annoys me crazy when Instagram refreshes my feed halfway i read the whole meme when opening the app. I want it to be like Twitter where even if you pull down and refresh you can have one more button to go to the top incase I want some more time reading the post i was already looking at. These are just measures to keep users addicted to the app. please fix it,1
"DEC2022 update: THE APP IS STILL GARBAGE. RUINED EVER SINCE THEY SOLD OUT TO FACEBOOK LIKE DEGENERATES. Worst app on the appstore. Absolute trash ever since they were bought out by Facebook years back. I wouldn't recommend this app to anybody at all, it's garbage. Would give 0/5 if possible. UPDATE: This app is EVEN WORSE than it was last year! I didn't think it was possible! Now it has even bigger censorship and shadow banning! PUT BACK CHONOLOGICAL ORDER ALREADY NOBODY LIKES YOUR ALGORITHIM BS",1
This apps shows me old version again and again. I uninstall the app so many times but unfortunately it's as usual,1
It is taking a long time to load and when i do get log in it thinks im a robot and makes me choose photos of things and then dosent work somone needs to fix this,1

"Terrible. It's been more than 48 hours and even post one update, insta is not workiy for me. Sevral issues. Sometimes the reels won't work, sometimes dm is gone and sometimes it will refresh but won't let me see others stories or post my stories. It's getting shittier day by day. Reported tons of times, looks like insta doesn't give a damn about its users.",1
"Can't even get the app to load. Click on it, see the instagram logo and then it's just a black screen. Uninstalled and reinstalled several times, cleared cache/data, restarted device. Garbage app.",1
After my account hack by someone... I restored my account and I unistalled my insta... again I installed but it's not opening.. all I can see is blank screen... it's happening from past 6 days ! So I logged in on Chrome.. but bad experience.. see to it.. Thank you!,1

"Instagram has lost touch with its purpose by trying to be something that already exists. I don't want to watch reels. And I don't want to see only the same 7 super popular infulcers in my feed. I'm here for photos, artworks, people I know, people I don't know, to get creative inspiration, to share my own artwork. And now? Now there's no point in even trying to scroll. They push reels, they super hone the feed so you only see the slightest fraction of what you follow. It's a dying platform.",1
"Hii ,I am give a one star , because I am not use swipe message option in Instagram and I am not change themes , I am not connecting to mesenger Instagram, I am very time report this issue but not solve this problem",1
Poor upgrade in sharing posts.. Previously it shows the recent contacts now it shows of irrelevant contact and contact from FB which is irritating and am not able to unsend in the popup as before. If there is option to downgrade i will definitely do it,1
Used to work well. Now when uploading photos they don't upload or save the way I edit them.,1
It's ok but don't really understand it . And a lot of people I've spoken to are saying the same. I remember using it years ago and it was fun . But now I'm going to take some star's away infect there should be a minus ‚ûñ so then I wouldn't have to leave you any star's,1
"Tbh, this has been my favorite social media app over Facebook. But today, all of a sudden, I was scrolling on my feed, a new page popped out.

Now pls reactivate my Instagram account bc I think it was just a mistake...",1
"Since updating 2 days ago, the app won't find any photos from my phone gallery. A deep search of ""other apps"" allows one picture at a time. Shocking, backwards step, like everything Meta/FB",1

I cannot log into another account. the screen is blank and it sits like that forever. Now I cannot log into the app anymore because I believed it was a phone issue.

"Too many bugs.. I can't open dms stories can't upload nor i can see any new posts reels, i am fed up uninstalling and reinstalling again & again..",1
It's been a long time now since that note option came to Instagram now but it's doesn't show up in my Instagram...at first i thought will come after updates but even after updating the option doesn't show up at all and it's very annoying.... Please do something,1
Quality always drop when updating story. Please fixed this issue. This is my humble request.,1
My explore page is filled with basic photography and architecture. Kinda like if I was logged out of my acc and given default instead of personalized posts. Fix this,1
"Instagram need to give dislike button, like you tube. Improve your app As soon as possible Thank you.",1
Alot of bugs Everytime you use the new professional dashboard/insights it throws you off. I do prefer the old layout. I've reported the problem but it hasn't been fixed.,1
"Constantly bugging out. Fonts change after uploads from the preview, music being out of sync, reels not uploading, drafts getting deleted or the reels option just not being there!

Experience is good....but why the audio call system has gone???????It's really a needed thing on social mediaüò°,1
Everytime I try to log into my account it shows some unknown error occured while sometimes it's alright. I thought the app is going through some maintainence but turns out it isnt. Please fix it. Had to uninstall and reinstall it,1
It would be nice if I can actually get some help or response. My account was suspended for 30 days and it would have been wonderful to actually know why. I literally have no contact with hardly anybody on there except my friends I know in real life. If I was reported I should be able to know why. And it would be nice if I had a way to contact you,1

"Every aspect has gone downhill. Reels don't load properly, drafts don't save properly, app constantly gets stuck, and I have to reboot almost every time I use it.",1
Many feature i have not got and when i have asked with my friends they were also facing the problems....we are unable to download the pics stories from our own profile...as well as we don't get the message replying features as whatsapp is having.....make it available for everyone... please,1
I used this app 2years ago and then when i was going to log in to my main account it says error it does says my main acc like my acc doesn't exist I really hate it please fix this.,1
"Sad I can't react to inbox msgz with an emoji, I only have the heart option. How is it we all download the same app and some don't get all benefits. My phone is a new model Samsung. I have tried to re install, no luck. Someone suggested to link with facebook....I don't have Facebook. And would that even be fair for ppl without. Really sad, is there a way to be able to react with an emoji other than a heart. Also other things like replying an inbox option...Really disappointing",1
"This app has become an insufferable clone of TikTok and its honestly maddening. The algorithm is very atrocious, as an artist, reach has been plumetting because of how the algorithm promotes reels better than photos. I. dont. want. to. make. videos. Most of us don't. We are forced to make videos so that your greedy corporate mind can compete with TikTok and abandon Instagram's true identity.",1
"Most of the time it saves the download link then tries to download from a completely different random app. It often requires you to login your Instagram account from the app, but the app never remembers your login info.",1
"Nice. But why does my app keep going off, I have uninstalled 2 times after a while when I open, it keeps shutting off",1

This application has nice features and very good attributes. Very easy to operate. Ultimately this application is wasting so much time of youth and make them chhapri and useless (applicable to girls also). Almost 90% of users have no sense that how to use it. Why one should have so much desire or care to watch anyone else's pics? I don't know why this type of applications are required in life. But no one can live without Instagram now. I rate this app in minus but ratings are not there.Thank you,1

I know I am not the only one dealing with this & I am sharing so that others don't fall victim to this.",1

Garbage app that no one should even keep on their phone. I don't even use my account yet it's always in some sort of problem.,1
There a glitch that whenever I try to open the app it suddenly goes off and after repeatedly clicking on the app for more than 5 times then it shows up. Also the reels which i post is not getting uploaded.,1
"I only use it every few days. But since yesterday (when there was an update) it will not launch anymore, which is disappointing. It has done this before and it started working again after further updates. I guess this is just down to poor quality control.",1

"I tried to sign up and I was suspended with a time stamp of tomorrow? I got passed that, not sure how, and the app didn't send a confirmation text. I wanted to contact Instagram, but they don't let you contact them because they don't want to talk to their users. Meta is complete and utter garbage.",1
"Worst experience. BUG found. After latest update, In gesture/full screen mode, the app still shows a blank space below the menu. Annoyed. Bad development and testing.",1

"As of recently it won't let me look at all my photos to post unless I go through a bunch of loopholes, and even then it will only let me select one photo at a time. This is extremely annoying and makes me want to undownload the app",1
I can't open the app. I keep uninstall n install - ing the app many times but it didn't work. I also did the delete cache and delete data too but still nothing. I keep getting stuck on the apps logo and then blank screen,1

I faced the problem of posts and followers and the bio are not appear and the stories disappeared. I reported this bug but Instagram did not resolve the problem üò°,1
"My account is not working properly while my network is to good. So, please have a look and try to solve the problem as soon as possible.",1
I didn't get notification properly so I uninstall and reinstall Instagram. Again I'm not able login even I try with my Facebook account also... Too worst,1
It used to be good but why the heck is the story and post quality degrading every now and then. It's so blurry and looks stupid when I post something. You just want me to share others reels and posts? Should I stop sharing something I've clicked? Everything just keeps getting blurred.,1
couldn't able to upload reels since a month. Tried every thing suggested on the website. Still no use.,1
These past days I'm not able to log into Instagram. As soon as I enter the app it keeps sawing a white blank screen. I thought I had some problem with my device so i tried rebooting many times and i also uninstall n reinstall it again but nothing works.. I also read some reviews n found out I ain't the only one facing this problem.. Please fix this problem as soon as possible..,1
The last update was the worst update I am not being able to watch reels and my search recommendations are also not showing.,1

Restarting My phone, clearing cache, restarting phone, rebooting, even deleted the app for a day & nothing is working! I need my IG for my business & this is ridiculous that nobody can be reached for this problem. Please this needs to be fixed asap!",1
I am also experiencing a blank screen everytime I log in. I'm currently using Instagram's webpage until the app is fixed. Update: I've been waiting three weeks for insta to take action. Idk why the app hasn't done anything when many people are reporting this issue,1
"A dying social media app. Another armature of the state apparatus used to censor and controll Information. Constant bots and scammer issues. Sponsored porn now is a thing here as well. Do yourself a favor and just go download minds app from their web page, not Google playstore as it will not work if you don't download directly from them.",1
"This isn't the app experience it used to be, it is littered with ads, unsolicited content and no longer has users at the forefront. It has lost it's identity entirely. I'd recommend Vero instead!",1

"Most broken app on Android history. Filled with bugs. And report system is not working because the Meta (Facebook) is working on the metaverse. Each update brokes something in the app. Also their ""algorithm"" only shadowbans artists and creators. Scsmmers and spam posters alwayd getsaway with it. If you have a bussiness and want to advertise on Instagram, just don't. Everybody will hate you because of this broken app.",1
I can't set songs rather then of English song on Instagram story We are unable to set a proper filter on Instagram which results we can't make reels,1
"The voice messages are not working, I can't listen to the new ones nor the old ones :(",1

I don't know why but the app developers are not much helpful in fixing of the bugs actually I have a problem that I am not able to login my own account or any to our create any other account,1
Horrible.. my account got hacked and I have sent emails asking for help and no one has even bother to respond to me. Fortunately I know someone and asked them to message everyone that my account has been hacked. But if this is type of service then everyone should install this app because no one here cares to help when you send emails for help,1
"New update sucks.. lots of bugs.. plz fix. Having troubles to make reels. the aap keep on crashing.. reels saved in draft dissapears.. this is happning only with me. Coz ive checkd with my cousins & friends im the only one facing this issue. Hav tried ever poosible thing. Changed passwrd,upadted,uninstalld & reinstalld again bt its stil the same.

"Instagram Security assistance and response is not of high standard which i held them to. My personal account was hacked, and I have been trying to recover my account for the past week, even by means of selfie video I had to submit as per request, but I am still left in the dark seeing that the time elapsed for Instagram security to respond has al=eady exceeded the 3-4 working days i was told. I am still awaiting any form of communication, help and assistance in this regard as it is a serious",1
My feed won't refresh. This is the 2nd time I've had this issue. Can't even reach the support page to let tech support know. I don't want to create a 3rd account only for this to happen again in a few months.,1
"Why it's not opening, I'm facing a problem like it's crashing while opening. Please troubleshoot it asap.",1
"The newest version of the app does not load. I have Uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times, to no avail. I have reported it multiple times, to no avail. I run a business utilizing IG, and I am stressing out.",1
"One day I love this application ‚ú®,but the latest version is too boar because so many glitches in this app and feeding photos never get clarity and clear.",1
"Like Facebook, Instagram should also allow deactivate or delete options directly. It becomes too difficult to login from somewhere else and then only once a week deactivate option is available. Please make it easier like Facebook",1
Since 2 months facing very bad problem. Mesages wont open. Cannot post storry. Cannot coment to anyone. App opens but foesnt work.,1
Awful update! The app won't even start...when you open the app a white screen freeze and you won t be able to view a login or signup page...Instagram used to be my fav social media platform but this bug isn't acceptable from the developers of a giant tech company like insta...fix this issue as soon as possible let the users be able to login again before anything else or I promise you'll lose alot of users in the near future...sad to see that happens,1
I would give the app a zero if I could. Problems when uploading photos. Frequently crashes just as you about to post. I joined Instagram to see friends and families photos not random photos/videos of accounts I don't care about.,1
"I can't access my full picture library and there is no update. I manage a business account, as well as my personal and my personal and business Facebook through Instagram. So it's highly disappointing to have this problem.",1
Application is crashed. . Having trouble to open it! Resolve it as earlier as it is possible.,1
Makes it too complicated to quit. I'm an addict. I want out. You keep giving 30 days to change my mind. I can't quit. I'm done. I want social medias out of my life. I hate Meta. Imagining telling your doc you need to quit cigarettes and he leaves a pack of smoke for 30 days in you're pocket for 30 days. I should have to option to ban myself from the app forever just like casinos. No 30 days. I want out now. Stop trying to keep users so desperately. Let us quit.,1
I have used this app for a long time and not had any problems but recently the app just shows a blank black screen when Im trting to log into my accounts. I have tried virtually everything to resolve this issue but nothing is working. Pls fix this!!!,1
"V weird update. I uploaded one reel using my old device. But one I see from it from my new device, it doesn't show. I am getting notifications on the same reel but not able to see it. It shows unavailable however from old device it's visible.",1
This new update is trash. I hate that I can't see any of my friends and family's post anymore my tl is full of videos and reels that I can see on tiktok it's all the same stuff being done by different users most of which are not people or pages that I follow or even care about. If I want to watch someone's reel I will go to their page or watch their story. I don't like that my friends have been replaced by influences I don't care about.,1
"Meow that Facebook bought Instagram, every 3rd/4th post is an ad. When you view stories, there's ads between almost every post. There's also daily spam because people copy accounts and pretend to be others. There's been nothing done to address that. Their ""suggestions"" take over your feed, so you don't see posts from friends any more either. You can disable them but only for 30 days?? I don't want TikTok. I want Instagram to be Instagram again. I don't want that stupid metaverse stuff either.",1
"Crashing all the time, batch photos can't be edited, the app is getting worse",1
I keep deleting and installing this app over and over again but I still keep getting a black screen on this app. It is really frustrating and I don't know what to do. It doesn't let me log in just keep showing me a black screen.,1
App keeps asking me to add my number to account; which i've done. Been waiting over an 1hr for the code. So I can gain access. Not too sure whats going on. Sort it out...,1
"Stupid app. I complained but no response came from the team. I'm not able to quote any reply, what you called as swipe reply. Please fix it as soon as possible.",1
Worst nowadays so many glitches when I see my latest following it shows me my oldest . I am unable to reply to a particular message. What the hell is this app doing?,1
Messages to my friends aren't sending. Neither are the posts that I'm trying to share with them via direct. I'll leave this app alone for a while while I use other platforms that work correctly.,1
When I open app it shows new posts for few sec. And after that that posts automatically hide and shows view old posts.,1
"Doesn't matter how many times I update or uninstall and reinstall....My messenger doesn't get updated. I'm not able to change the theme of the chat , react to texts or swipe to reply. Kindly check into the problem . I have been reporting this since last few months. But no improvement is seen",1
"A lot of dirty videos have started coming in it. Stop these dirty videos, otherwise I will delete the app.",1

"I don't know what happened, but all of a sudden the app keeps shutting down any time I try to do ANYTHING, and the instagram so-called ""team"" clearly does NOT care about their users AT ALL. I'd rate this 0/5 stars if I could. Absolute trash app!!",1

"There was a option to download video,in gallery...but now , after update I'm not able to... please fix this,or I have to uninstall this app",1
I just want to enter my account without having to change my password every time. my first password was fine and it wouldn't let me go back to that,1
I use this app since 5 years ago and it was really enjoying but nowadays it has become so trush I mean whenever I open this app my phone goes restart only for this app And I can't open this app so please kindly fix it Otherwise I love this app it is so much fine and attractive so I'm giving it two star only üòëüòó,1
It was good before Facebook buying the Instagram because most of the accounts has been hacked of my friends and my account has been detected officially from Instagram I don't know why the did this. I don't know why Facebook do such a echa behaviour. Just don't buy any other good social medias Facebook.I don't want to give Even a single Star for this.,1

"May I know why it keeps saying ""the username that you entered doesn't belong to an account?"" Like I tried it on my laptop which says the same thing but on my other phone it works? If there was no account, then how on earth I can use it on my other phone? Seriously the issues of Instagram is getting worse and worse. Even 1 star is too much. I would really want this problem to be fixed because it is annoying.",1
Instagram is not like ita uses to be before There are so many login errors and other glitches inside the app such as the music not syncing with my reels and even sometimes after all the editing the reel just does not post There are also issues regarding dms most of the time they just do not load Please solve these issues for the average user,1
"Meta is like a dictator, but a corporation. It serves advertisers, not customers. Endless adds and content is blocked by lame algorithms. I deleted my account because of endless ads",1
"After I updated the app I can't even copy a message that was sent to me from my friends and I can't unsent a message on this app it's very much stressful and being unbearable for me cause it gets worse each day, if there's 0%rate I would rate it 0% please you have to do something and fix this problem for me so I can be able to enjoy the app as usual before this problem raises",1
"When I switched over to a business account->go to ""profile""->then ""creator tools""-> then try to look at my insights it'll always exit out of the app. I've tried updating the app and it doesn't work. It's getting so annoying!",1
"Meta is trash, rumble is where it's at. Instagram is filled bots, crypto vultures and women who want to be my friend for an hourly rate.",1
facing many bugs in this app...please resolve this issue asap...please...facing these type of bugs since last one weeksüôèüôèüôèüôè....not able to reed mesages and story too...please do somethingüôè,1
Profiles won't load. Pictures in feed won't load. Stories won't load. The app is useless at this point. The only reason I've been keeping it was for the reels bonuses but now even that doesn't work even though it says I'm eligible.,1
As my review had been removed I thought I'd post it again. Instagram in the last few years has completely changed. It used to be enjoyable yet now its just full of accounts that I don't know on my feed and pages of ads. It has definitely forced me to come off the app and look else where.,1
I don't have access to insta notes feature update....I have tried to report it many times but nothing worked.. Please fix it,1
"This app is getting struck all the time I have to uninstall and then install again for this issue, But still getting this error after refreshing",1
WORSE APP EVER. Can't ever get an account recovered from a hacked user or report accounts as hacked. Update this IG this is a huge privacy and security problem in 2023. Should be much easier to recover account access instead many users get stuck having to make brand new accounts while some hacker gets their hands atpeoples personal stories chats and life Zuckerberg seriously is a national security threat!,1
"Unable to login in both web and app...all of a sudden it us asking to wait fr sometime to login,unable to generate password to recover account.",1

Instagram is not opening at all. It's just starting then a blank screen appears and the app never starts. It is a very bad experience. I am suffering from last 10 days . Please üôè check it once,1
"I tap 'Not interested' for a content, but you repeat it again and again showing the content for me. Disgusting.",1
"The app wouldn't load sometimes and won't show my pictures when trying to post. On top of that, when sending someone a post is all f-uped, it shows suggestions instead of my actual top conversation, making me search for the person I want to send, why should I do that? I shouldn't have to go looking for the last person I talked to",1
The algorithm is designed to completely screw you over if you're not doing EXACTLY what they want to make them more money. Atrocious and damaging to the breadth of their users. Def going downhill,1
"A s described by another user, I tried to sign out of one of my accounts and sign into another, and I am now trapped in a purgatory in between screens and cannot use the app. I have uninstalled it, every started my phone, and nothing. If I install Instagram and open it, I am greeted by the load up logo page, and then just go to an endless black screen.",1
The app was fine till within the last few weeks. App opens with the logo and then goes black and nothing loads. Pretty lots of other people are having the same. Haven't been able to access the app Finally got updated and is writing Working.... after a freaking month üòëüôÑ,1

"I can't even search for songs to put it on my stories and it keeps saying ""No results found"" to names i typed. Idk what's going on with Instagram lately ya'll do not fix the bugs and everything and it becomes a problem for us.",1
"For the last few hours I have not been able to view my feed (the posts from people I follow). I also can't view any of my followers or the people I follow. I have checked to see if the app needs updating, which it doesn't. I have uninstalled and re-installed the app. I have logged out and signed back in again... NOTHING.",1
"app finally got an update but it still doesn't work, everytime i try to log in or even simply just openning the app it just shows a blank white screen. i tried everything even rebooting my phone but it still doesn't work. the app on ios phone still works but it gives us android users a hard time.",1
"Worst social media ever, after whats app of course... it is full of bugs. The blank screen error is so annoying and there arent any handful solutions or updates for it yet. Recently, I bought a brand new smart phone and all the thing instagram is giving me is just this damn blank screen without any link or login requirements... i am totally pissed offüò°üò°üò°üò°",1

I used to love Instagram but I HATE THEM ! I had a Facebook and Instagram account linked together. My Instagram only had on it pictures I took of the night sky and videos of my antique dolls and 2 photos of my daughter who since passed away. Without giving any warning at all they deleted my account! No warning !!! Which meant my Facebook was gone too! I never posted a thing offensive or had one argument with anyone . All my messages from my daughter and her memorial page gone .,1

The feed is not refreshing the new post of the following accounts is not updating and the different problems as always it is not good worst than the beta version.,1
"I genuinely hate the fact that you can't turn off suggested posts. If i really wanted to look at other things apart from the people I follow, I'd just search for them. Also, there's wayyy too many ads, there's one every 3 or 4 posts, it's incredibly annoying. to add on this a year later. it's getting worse. ADD AN OPTION TO TURN OFF SUGGESTED POSTS FOR THE MAIN FEED.",1
"I don't know what is wrong. I can't open Instagram, it's all blank and I even updated my phone but I still can't use it. Please help me out , I have tried everything.",1

Trash application üëéif you are a genuine content creator then this app isn't for you.. too many bugs.. gives you strike without checking.. they removed upi payment options and doesn't loading the page of debit card payments..

"My account was hacked into , taken over and I absolutely cannot get it back or into it.. this account is many years old!

WHY IS IT SO EASY FOR HACKERS AND SCAMMERS TO SECURE AN ACCOUNT AND TAKE IT OVER BUT ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET YOUR OWN ACCOUNT BACK!!!! I JUST WANT MY ACCOUNT BACK!! They're contacting people on my follow list. NOT A SECURE PLATFORM AT ALL!!! SO much hackers and scams going on",1
"They have the audience, the network effect and the stickiness so they don't care about QA any more. No new app with this number of feature-breaking bugs could possibly rise to the top - it has to already be at the top to get away with it.",1
"The app hasn't been opening for me at all for the past 4-5 days. I have tried everything - i restarted my phone, i uninstalled and reinstalled the app, i wiped the cache, i updated the app, etc. Nothing is working. Please help me fix this issue asap.",1
I use both iphone and now this s22 ultra. Insta on iphone is much much user user friendly. Much easier to use. Going forward and back from a post is wayy easier swiping left or right on the iphone. Android developers should look into it.,1
"Every time I post any reels, story or post it takes a long time and the reel story and post gets corrupt after posting it please watch on this and solve it quickly",1
"It's been 3 days my instagram isn't working. Nothing is loading, I can't even report the problem. So I'm here please look out for my problem!!!",1

"This app is just continuing its downward spiral into near uselessness. Went to post some content today but instagram won't display my gallery any more.

"So from one day to another the app just didn't work anymore. I cleared cache, and all the other fun stuff... And nothing!!!",1
"Hiii my name is altaf. Instagram not working very well what the reason? Some time i am touch the story icon but the story button not reason.

My phone is good but Instagram not working very well so i give 1 star. And plz Instagram improve your app.",1
"Just today I couldn't add multiple photos from my camera within the app. Reels is always glitching on me, squeezing or stretching the fonts. And lately the whole app crashes multiple times while posting.",1
"This accounts from this app gets easily hacked. Also, the security bridge is not good enough as being compared to other social media apps. There are so many shortfalls I can't mention sequencially that I've experienced with this app in less than 2 months of usage.",1
"I use to love this app but now everything keeps crashing and I am unable to log in. I have tried all possible ways,I need help.",1

"It's great that the developers of this app bring out updates so frequently however those updates don't solve anything, if anything the quality of the app has been stagnant for months. I only use this app to communicate with my family members in another country but if it wasn't for that I would have uninstalled a long time ago. Do better Instagram. Do better.",1
Very poor. Always full of glitch. Not even a reel gets uploaded properly. Very much dissapointed.,1
"Ever since the latest update, I can't upload any pictures I have taken on my phone while in Instagram. I have to go back out to my camera and load and post separately from my camera. Making it impossible to add multiple photos to a post.",1

"My account wouldn't refresh and was rendered unusable so I uninstalled and re-download but now eveytime I open the app it's just a black screen... pls fix this I've lost everything from old conversations, pictures, and even friends.",1
I don't like that you can't click on the picture to see it bigger. I hate that it's migrating to prioritizing videos over other content. Stop trying to be Snapchat and TikTok. The algorithm situation makes it so hard to enjoy the app but it's something I need to promote my business.,1
Instagram is not allowing me to use the latest version even after updating it..... I am unable to use basic things like reacting and replying msg... Plz fix the bug,1
"Why my Instagram not working, its too slow loading, buffering, not open inbox only loading not showing anything.... Please solve this bug or technical issue ASAP.",1
Highly disappointed.. my account is hacked and it's been 3 days still no proper response from Instagram. I used to love this application alott but now I m just frustrated,1
EDIT: cache won't clear. EDIT: Not working again. Multiple ongoing problems. Dropped the stars to one.,1
To much bugs in this app... My app automatic hang and stop. My network strength is also good but this app not working properly.,1
My identity was stolen & all of my accounts were hacked. Instagram is the ONLY app that has consistently refused to address this. Idk who or what kind of service people use to make it look like they have more friends than they really do or try to get people to be friends b/c I have plenty of friends & don't have to use a service to get them. Please address this issue I'm having. ( Issue since March 2022),1
Impossible to upload pictures without a black tray at the left side. Super buggy and annoying,1
I want to create an account. Tried it so many times. No solution found anywhere. This is very bad. This app should help me immediately.,1
"Very unhappy at the lack of support or capability of retrieving hacked accounts. Had mine hacked a few months ago and a friend hers, no support in retrieving or shutting them down. Have another account now, but receive at least a dozen scam messages a week. Really needs sorting out, it's devasting to lose an account you've built up over several years and not be able to do anything other than watch them use your account to scam others.",1
"All of a sudden my account isn't working, it says to enter a code to verify my contact number and i never receive any message. What's your solution i need this fixed",1
An unknown error has occurred please try logging in again. Constantly. Tried all the fixes.,1
"Impractical user layout, terrible algorithm... Too many ads and suggested posts that you do not want to see. IG makes it impossible now to stay connected with those who actually matter to you - your friends and family. They have come a long way since their launch in 2012, and not in a positive way. I still have my account with them because I value the memories and posts I have made in the past but unfortunately that is all what IG is now - outlived and archaic.",1
My notes feature went missing.. it used to show up before... And i did multiple bug reports still no answer from them.,1
There are some issues with my profile. I complaint many time but no response. My followers no is changing per hour without any real change. Sometimes it show 200 followers after 5 min it's 0. Then again 50 or 100 any no. After Sometimes it's automatically change again . This problem sustain since last 3-4 days . But help section is totally useless. I wish I can give 0 rating but there is no option for that. Like they have no option for problems solving,1
Timeline should be just for accounts that I follow not for suggestions isn't explorer enough and why it show me older post I just wanna see the newest first I don't get it shouldn't updates make it better?! but it's getting worst üòÆ‚Äçüí®,1
"F**king App , Really hard to watch reels and some reels are keep on loading and i need to know why i am facing this issue, Now adays Instagram is worst compared to other applications",1
The recent updates are just trash. It seems like every update gets similar to tiktok and it shows. Every post now being a reel is unnecessary bc if u have posted reels before they are completely hidden between the posts that are now reels too. Stop making those useless updates all the time it gets pretty annoying bc deleting insta is the best solution atm.,1
"After installing latest update instgram is not working in my phone Realme X2 Pro, I tried with previous version of Instagram it's working fine.",1
"I hate instagram nowadays. As a small business owner, I've to put content everyday. There are too many glitches I've to face everyday! Please check.",1
No point in having a not interested button if its gonna do the opposite of what its supposed to do. Everytime i look at reels im literally pressing not interested on almost every video and when i refresh or re open the app all it shows me is those types of videos,1
Very bad . I didn't even wanted to give one star. Save option is not showing in story when any reel is shared in story..,1
With 12K followers Reels stuck at 0 views. It's so frustrating and absolutely makes no sense unless its some kind of shadow ban. Please fix it. Or we are force to switch to YT or VERO.,1
"It's very bad. I needed confirmation code, but they always say they have send it.Whiles they haven't sent it",1
For the love of God fix your platform. I get 49 plus follow request a day and that many message request. Instagram has turned into spam central. I will be deleting soon if not fixed. Just plain horrible.,1
1.) Why aren't my messages sent on Instagram? 2.) When I join someone's live why can't they see my face and why does it keep ending even though it hasn't? 3.) Why can't I uninstall it? No matter how fast my internet is it takes like forever to send a message and it doesn't even refresh my feed. This app is becoming more trash day by day. Please fix this problem and I'll give you your stars.,1
"My Instagram app is constantly crashing. I open it and within 5 second it is crashing by itself. I tried Reinstalling, and still there is no improvement. It doesn't works. Help solving this issue asap",1
my account has alot of problems and I don't know how to fix it i kept refreshing home page but I don't get any post and when i went to my profile it didn't work plz fix the issue :(,1
I am facing issue with my message section it show old messege when i am opening app and seeing it always. And i am unable to download reel when i put it on my story .,1
Too many ads. It is free though. Update: keeps crashing after update. Unusable. Was easy enough to use. I seem to get more ads than other people I know who use app!,1
How to seek and reverse 10s in reels. Reels are long these days and need a way to move thorough just like in videos.,1
Can't seem to change my 2 factor authentication. Gets stuck in the loading screen forever.,1
I didn't even use it yet I downloaded the app and now to finish the application I have to take a selfie. So before using it I'm done with it. None of the other ppl I know went through that process.,1
"When i want to add another account, black screen came out. I tried to restart my phone also re-install the app and it become more worse becouse it show me black screen from the start. I cant even use this app anymore. I read some comments below and i saw many people has the same problem. So this is of course the problem its from the apps not from my phone. My phone samsung s20",1
This app disappoints me so much. Whenever I tried to add hashtags on my post after posting the reel hashtags gets disappeared and my captions too . I hope Instagram team will work on this issue.,1
"Only shows three latest post from who you follow then shows unlimited posts from other people you don't follow, shows ads after every post even if you block the account.",1
"Since the update past 2 days i'm unable to log into my ac. The instagram just appears blank. I tried all possible methods like unistalling and installing again, updating the app and deleting storage. All on vain... I kindly request the support help team to kindly look into the matter at the earliest and do the needful Thank you",1
"this app was actually one of my fav apps. but something happend and i don't like it because i want to log in but it keeps pomping up the word ""dismiss"" so i can't log in.... can u do something 'bout it? i need it RN!!!! üò≠üò≠üò≠ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1
"Every time I try to log on, I am given a white screen, the web site still works. I have tried for months and nothing has worked. Instagram whether its a bug or something fixed, please fix it.",1
There's an issue with the new update and reels. I can't add a video from my gallery to reels no matter the length. It never had that issue before. This update needs an update. Not good,1
"My app is crashing after recent update. Whenever I open the app it stops abruptly and closes itself. I have tried everything cleared cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the app but nothing worked. Frustrated with this, fix this ASAP.......",1
I had to look up how to show an entire photo and apparently I can't. This app is garbage for a lot of other reasons too.,1
"Suspended my account without any good reason. I believe this is happening globally since weekend, but they have not released any update as to why this is happening.",1
Too much bug few month. Ago. In my account invite collaborator option available and. Now. Its not available i report this problem 100 of times but no any response and action taken by Instagram teamüòêüòê,1
It's been one and half months now and still Instagram isn't opening it is just showing blank screen. At first I thought that this is a problem of my phone but when I just saw the reviews of Instagram I realised that not only me so many people's are suffering with this problem. I actually installed Instagram Lite but it is not as the original Instagram. I hope it will fix soon. Cuz it's giving me and so many other people's so much problems.,1
"Sincerely, CHILL! I'm so tired of the changing layout that this time I might actually uninstall it for good. A favourite section for 'Following'? Really?I don't mind sponsored posts but I followed pages in the first place to see them on my home page. And where are those other options like Arts and Architecture and stuff? What happened to igtv? Those were the features that brought me to the app. Don't even get me started on the shopping thing. Can't y'all check it first before forcing it on us?",1
Not working properly. Downloading slow. Only buffering. App is not opening.,1
The app hangs alot the message box doesn't open more often moreover tagging message in chats is yet another beating the bush to get on with.,1
"I have been using Instagram for a long time but I have never been so frustrated using this , it's been 1month but still it's showing white blank screen I have updated the app to even tried to remove all the caches and tried several times again, I have also reinstalled the app too but still no luck. Please try to resolve my case",1
"I really dono y this app was not good now a days, I'm facing problem like after 50% data exists it won't work at all properly.i have got bad experience in this app.",1
Instagram suggested profile button is no longer available. Browsing profiles with similar interests is now difficult to do. Poor IG.,1
"Dear Instagram Team, bonuses option is not showing in my id @tharreels011 i upload 1 video every day i need bonuses option it is very helpful for me please provide me this option as soon as possible Thank You.",1
"The default feed only shows me companies and suggested posts, I have to go into ""following"" to actually have some semblance of a real feed. Please change it",1
"Updates don t work. I can t react to messages with anything else than the heart, can't drag to replay messages in groups, can't use the ""add yours"" thing on stories, some songs don t appear on the song list while for other friends of mine do. This app is becoming more and more disappointing as time passes",1
"Since the update, I cant see what I'm typing, dont know if anybody else had this issue? The box you type into is no UNDER my keyboard so you can't see it",1
"Everything f√ºrn arsch cause insta is pushing reels so hard. Also I get spammed so much by garbage shein bot stories, report every single one, Instagram doesn't care at all.",1
Love what the app has to offer but every time I post a reel I have to make sure the audio or visual comes out right. Sometimes the visual is flipped or the audio is just white noise.,1
"Shity app and even worse support, which doesn't communicate! So if IG is failing all the time, obviously up to them, no help. No use, no communication. TikTok! Ciao IG :)",1
"I have given one star for video quality experience.and too much like photo quality upload blurry, ads showing instagram. I hate ads",1
This app is not working well because the other person are replying my msgs I am not able to see in the msg box and not able to reply but in the notification i can see the replying msgs and I able to reply the other person msgs soo please fix this problem as soon as possible please üôè,1
"There is a lot of glitches in the app, chat version is super old, and the look of the app on my device is so different to what other people have. Reported the problem so many times yet the issue remains as it was.",1
"Everytime I try to upload a photo on my story the photos becomes black and the only thing you can see is the text. I won't even try to report it in-app 'cause I got ignored another time, when my ""add yours"" sticker didn't work (and it still doesn't since I got IGNORED). It's getting pretty annoying, if you tell the right email address I can contact you to receive support. Thanks.",1
"I've tried for 2 days to link an existing account but it gave me a black screen. After trying to do it on my laptop and realising the option wasn't there, I decided to log out of my two already linked accounts, so as to log in on the account I was trying to link. Little did I know that it would give me the black screen without any possibility to log in to ANY of them. I've uninstalled the app and redownloaded it, and I still can't log back in. I can't do anything.",1
Since one year ...am asking you to please update my insta or check issue ...it is not showing any other emoji and no reply options and new features !!!....do resolve it plzzzz,1
It's good app but many at times I can't save any reels Means saving reel option is disappeared from reels....,1
"App always encounters login and account problems. I'm tired IG, I'm tired always going through suspension when my account is private and personal yet I encounter such things. Trying to appeal to suspencion RUNS TOO SLOW LIKE YOU DONT WANT US TO USE THE APP.",1
"Screen is blank when opening the app, even after uninstalling and reinstalling. Cleared all cache, net connection is good but to no avail. My phone is up-to-date. Hope this get fixed soon.",1
"I have been more than patient with this app but this is the last straw. First, my account was hacked and customer service couldn't do anything about it so I created a new account nearly 3 months ago and have already followed and dmed a few people and today when I logged in I couldn't see any posts or stories and all my dms disappeared. I used to have a great experience and now this app is littered with ads and hackers and I simply can't take it anymore. Deleting my account after this.",1
Won't let me delete account on the app or in a browser. Says I need to be logged in and I am. These people are unbelievable,1
"Welcome to House of bugsüòÇ You should increase the length of the story, its only 15s, while the reels can now make upto 1m, I can't understand the logic behind this, atleast increase it from 15s to 30s. Otherwise add a trimming option. 15s is outdated and not user friendly. Provide enable/disable option for autoplay videos",1
"Can't swipe to reply and react on a message , Chat themes not available even after reporting this problem several times , Fix this instagram.",1
"The other day, I went on Instagram and it logged me out. I didnt remember my password so I changed it but it wouldn't let me log in so I thought it was just a glitch I kept trying but no luck. I uninstalled then reinstalled the app thinking that would help. Now it's just showing me the Instagram logo then to a black screen.",1
the fact that they changed it to try be like every other app is pathetic. I'd like to see my friends on my feed but instead i see random stuff from people I don't follow. The explore page exists for a reason. Change it back.,1
The songs which were used early. which was not working properly on Instagram story highlights it's said that the song is not currently available?! Can't add music on our storyüòëwhat the.. worst app ever,1
Despite of having many updates I'm unable to post stories more than 15 sec . I'm constantly facing this issue and it's kinda frustrating.,1
"I am a long time, avid photographer. As much as I hate the sizing, framing, resolution and algorithm limitations of Instagram and how it has defined and ultimately damaged the medium. I accept that Instagram the only place to get my work seen by friends, family and people outside the photography community. Now, lately my feed is jammed with videos I don't/won't watch, advertising for product I won't buy, and spambots hijacking #tags. Meta! Please! I just want posts from people I follow!",1
"After watching some reels, in the end there is a one second clip also recorded. Whats that someone is watching reels and recorded silently.?",1
It has a lot of problems inside the app like with the short videos and the chats it lack a lot so it is a very bad program,1
"The latest update is terrible. When I go to make a new post it only shows me the photos I already posted to IG. Then when I change the folder, I can't select multiple photos. Undo this last update please!!",1
This sux! I have downloaded and uninstalled app so manytimes it's ridiculous! It just keeps crashing!!! A bug or something. Am very disappointed at this. Can't make or receive calls....with many other things üò§üò°üò†ü§¨,1
"Since yesterday, the app started skipping stories by its own. I don't touch the screen, and it just jumps over some stories as if I were trying yo skip th, and doesn't let me return to them anymore",1
Since last update I've had nothing but problems. First I tried to open app and it kept closing. Couldn't use for about a day and then today I go and try to make a post and it's just a black screen and I can't even make a post. Needs fixed asap.,1
"Crashes every time I try to open notifications. I've tried multiple ""fixes"" but nothing works. For an app with so many users, I'm surprised it's so buggy.",1
"I follow people for a reason -I want to see their content and be engaged with them. With all these horrible updates I no longer see any of the people I follow and instead I am flooded with Ad's and content of people I don't follow. Everything is videos now, pictures never make it to my feed. I don't have tiktok - if I wanted tiktok I'd download it. This ap has become another version of tiktok. It's sad. This app used to be so great and was my favorite.",1
"What's the need for new features like ""notes""? It just looks weird and just creates an obstruction!",1
After updated it's not working properly.. I can't see my DM.. and I can't do anything... It's not updating posts.. storys.. DM.. etc.,1
Worst app for artist . Everytime I upload something on it it always ends up compressing my photos and videos even in stories . I worked hard in my photos and I don't like being compressed I hate that feature a lot .,1
‚Ä¢ Too many unnecessary permissions! Instagram (Facebook) probably uses them to track people. The app is buggy. Terrible for messaging.,1
"App has basically stopped working. In order to use it I have to uninstall and reinstall. It'll work for a short time after reinstalling, and then it will not refresh or allow any type of UI interaction",1
App does not let me access any locations/places. My location is turned on.,1
This app is bad since 3-4 month my basic features was not working and also note option was not working please resolve the problem as soon as possible,1
"I posted photos yesterday just fine. Today, when I go to add photos to my post, the gallery only has photos that I've already posted on Instagram. I can't get to my camera gallery at all. This is a pretty useless app for me now if I can't post new photos.",1
Zero customer support for this app? Well first Facebook bought them and you know how terrible they are. Need I say more? Now that they own it the ads have increased and they try to have me add people I don't know but they say I do. They try to sell me stuff I don't want. It used to be more fun . It's enjoyable if you can get pass all the garbage. Now I can't get into the app and everyone says my account is still there. Still won't refresh on my side. They will let people scam and spam u.,1
I miss Instagram when it was Instagram! Stop the constant ads and constant sponsored posts. We want to see posts from the people that we choose to follow! Stop controlling what we see. Instagram is not tiktok you need to stop showing preferential posting treatment to reels versus photos. My photos used to get hundreds of likes now I'm lucky for a few dozen. Worst thing ever when Facebook bought this and took over. VERO here I come too! (Like everyone else is doing),1
"Both Instagram and Facebook has absolute annoying tendency to show you ONLY ""suggested for you"" on the main page although you follow so many profiles. This is not how it suppose to work and is not a matter of cookie settings or privacy. I know how the software works. Give people a break, reduce suggestions and adverts because sooner or later users will be changing platforms.",1
"Why have a block accounts button when it never works? It says it blocked the account and then says it couldn't. This is every time, not just once.",1
"Instagram requests my phone number verification, but the verification message never came. Now I can't use my Instagram account. üôÑüôÑüôÑ",1
After recording video it's show as blurred..many times reported from app..buts no response from team..my camera setting are fine..prblm in only videos recorded by instagram..2 weeks b4 it was working fine but don't know what's the problem now..tried updates and reinstalled too..but nothing worked..sad that their team seems not concerned abt issue client facing..,1
Worst thing heaping with me when I installed Instagram APP first of all the App was not open totally screen was blank in black colour I tried so many times but it's continuously showing black. Please resolve my problem and fix my issue. Thankyou,1
I have an account on this app it was all going good but suddenly my account got locked and the number and email I saved on this got changed and now it is not opening kindly pay attention on it and tell me what happened... It is not safe anymore.. I'm not able to open it... If account is hacked kindly delete it or give me any other help regarding the problem...,1
"Horrible!!!... I always get glitches when my phone is updated or even Instagram is updated. Everytime I view a story' it's goes blank, suddenly flash screen occures, Don't know what's the problem with this Instagram. Get it fixed soon. Or u will be losing many users soon üòë",1
Day by day this application is detoriate. Music option not available for the reels and stories and post. Showing me not available for your region though in my another account I have access of music in all. I report many times but no response from the support team. So disgusting support team they have.,1
Most of the features for my main account aren't available but for my alt account they are there I don't get the point of this but just because of these minor feature not being there it makes the app not so user friendly,1
"Ever since Mark Zuckerberg bought this software, it has always had silly problems. Updates are not activated for everyone, there is a special rule for each account, accounts are banned without reason, without violating privacy, and incomprehensible bugs always arise. Even the support group does not give a correct answer to anyone. My account was closed multiple times for no reason, my picture was requested with a code, and I sent it, and none of my accounts was never opened again.",1
Worst experience nowadays. I'm not able to scroll it even for a minute whenever I open it the screen get freeze for 4-5 second and then it get back to home screen. instagram plz fix all bug & glitches.. it's very irritating to bear,1
This new update is the worst update so far. I can't see the tick mark when I try to save posts twice. I can't see my comment replies and the likes of it.,1
"Extremely disappointed. I only get to see a few posts on my home page, then it says ""couldn't refresh"". My network is not the problem. And I have uninstalled, the reinstalled the app again. I don't know what else to do, but this is not working correctly.",1
"My instagram never updated...i have tried many times but it still remain same. There is problem in reaction on reels and posts by different type of Emojis, also there is the problem in swipe the message... I can't swipe the message or don't do the particular replies ü§êü§ê.",1
"Why the account keep getting error not found? The ID is correct. Email is correct. The simplest thing yet it is so hard.... meta verse ""rocking""",1
I have trying almost form 1 month to get my note feature on Instagram but no support is being provided by Instagram yet i have been reaching them from past 2 months but nothing happend,1
I'm not able to send the message and if i send the reciever doesn't receiving the messages improve ur quality,1
I don't want this app to give this rating but you have forced me to do so. Like my Insta is having a glitch that when I open it nothing shows up instead of a black screen from 1 month I have tried everything I could but nothing helps. Now I have came here seeking help. Please consider this request. And I will make the rating better if I get a solution soon. Thanks.,1
"Well, this is a good app but from so many days whenever I open it only a white screen comes and then nothing happens and I have done many things to solve this but it didn't solve and I have also tried in my laptop also but in laptop it is showing that,""oops an error occurred"". I am so upset with this thing and I am also not able to use instagram. (Instagram please solve this problem) üôèüèª",1
Very worst .. Lof of issues in my Instagram app... Some one hacked... I think. So... So much bugs... Past 1 week i didn't use Instagram,1
Tried to create an account and was immediately told I had violated their terms of service before I even logged in. They asked me to send a photo of myself holding a handwritten note including my name and a number they sent me. I did that. Apparently that wasn't good enough because they never bothered to respond.,1
All the pictures that i posted were of high pixels but when i posted them on my insta account their quality decreased and they became like they were not even worth posting.,1
"This app sucks now that Instagram changed the layout of everything. Everything was fine the way it was, why change it??",1
If someone steals your account and changes your email you will never get it back. Also the call center never picks up their phone.,1
"Really buggy had install reinstall when installed, posting story with videos then adding music not intuitive and incredibly time consuming not clear what to do at all, when loaded half the stuff missing.",1
It Won't let me post or change profile photo it keeps saying editing error I've uninstalled and reinstalled doesn't help,1
"what's this , it's not Instagram, it'is videogram . we need Instagram not story and reel and videos . my feedback is make an old Instagram with Facebook moments application in a new update name it Instagram. and this app 2022 name it videogram",1
"Tried logging on with new phone. It won't accept my password. So, I reset the password via their link. I try it, Instagram says ""We need to send a code"". OK, code sent. Try code, Instagram says ""Code expired"" (they just sent it seconds ago), OK, send another code. NO! Must wait 60 seconds! Whatever, I wait. Request a new code. Code received. Input code. Code not accepted. I'm done. Uninstalled. Bye!",1
"In last few days the app is not working at all, whenever i try to open the app it goes blank, i have tried every possible thing to solve this issue but couldn't do it. And its not just me who is facing this issue, there are many others. I would request Instagram to resolve this issue asap.",1
"this app is a nightmare and my only reason to have it is a few artists who haven't moved on to other apps yet. definitly a waist of time rather if you are a creator or a consumer because the algorithem suck. if you want to see just how bad this app is you can look it up on youtube, trust me there is no shotage of videos about it. (sorry for bad English)",1
"App hasn't opened on my Android (Pixel 5) for several days. Restarting device, redownloading the app, checking for phone upgrades, clearing the cache.... nothing has worked. This started after I tried logging in and out of an account. I am clearly not the only reviewer with this problem-- lots of 1-stars from the same exact issue!!!",1
"Account deactivated when setting it up. A week ago I decided to install Instagram, fill in my email, fill in an account name, go to next, something goes wrong and I am back at the choose account name screen, I choose the name again, the app tells me the name is taken. Repeated the process one/ two times with new names. My account got blocked. I register my phone number and asked for review, 24 hours later my account is deactivated. Time to uninstall the app I imagine...",1
"Hi. There is some problem in my Instagram. It is not opening, it keeps on closing when I try open instagram. I have restarted my phone, updated the app but the problem is still not resolved. It is closing again and again. Please help!",1
I find it pathetic that a full year (08/2021) since my last poor review the issues persist. Uploading more than one image at a time disables editing and now you cannot upload multiple images AT ALL. I had to use the website to do it. Meta is a poor company.,1
"Why is it working badly, not loading anything everythings get stuck if entering to any options and can't see any shared contents from anybody.",1
"Horrendous android experience. Reels editor is buggy as h3ck. Constantly flips videos, has horrendous screeching audio sounds, and degrades quality. Honestly just a terrible experience as a creator. As a consumer it's OK.",1
while watching reels it gets stuck like after watching 4 to 5 reels it does not go up. why is this happening please resolve it.Have updated the then too the same problem appears in my search feed it stops loading after sometime can't see the post and reels in search option.,1
"Can't login. I keep getting ""sorry we couldn't complete your request. please try again in a moment"" every time i tried to login.",1
"Whenever i open the app it's not working properly. I can't view any stories, can't see any post, nor post my own stories/posts. Please make a move about this issues and update it sooner. Thank you",1
I don't like this app because it keep kicking me from the apps and It always say couldn't refresh feed and it also say last updated 30oct but I already updated it.,1
"Swipe reply is not working in my Instagram account. Due to this I am facing lot of problems. I am not able to reply to any message properly. In this, dirty advertisements also come in between. So I request you to kindly solve this problem as soon as possible. Otherwise I have to delete this app.",1
"I think insta is becoming worst... The reels video which I save in the looses original audio and sounds different it's not for only one video it's happening for all the videos please fix it, it sounds awkward",1
"Yesterday, i updated the app after that message box is full of glitches and it doesn't any messages in any account which is really frustrating. So , fix this glitch as soon as possible.",1
There is a bug in my app and it just won't work. When I open the app it would go black as if nothing would work. And can't even report a bug fix since it's not even letting me into my account.,1
"My acc once hacked and I can't login back,then today my new acc tht i used for almost a year got suspended with no reasons, hate this app so much. I don't suggest this app to anyone who loves keep their memories/moment by pictures...",1
"Instagram is garbage, you can't see your message list, I have to look up each person I want to talk to.",1
"I still have not been able to use the new messaging feature. I can't swipe reply, apply themes in dms.",1
"It listens to your video chat for ad data. I haven't seen an Instagram jeopardy ad in years, mention it during vidchat and next day see an ad for jeopardy. They need to mention this in the privacy policy. (Previous review 9/22) Suggested posts is still a pretty awful feature. I usually just want to see older posts I missed while passively scrolling. Clicking View older posts will barely load 5 of them.",1
"Instagram has became a totally trash app, first of all it keeps closing on it's own. And i had 95k followers last night, and suddenly in the morning it's 94.7k. And even on following the followers number doesn't go up, instead it goes down. I gave 5 stars to instagram before but i'm not even willing to give it a single star now. Instagram didn't improved, it has only become worse!!!!",1
"Most recent update... can't direct message, post, or watch videos. App completely crapped on me.",1
Keeps telling me to confirm my cell number but it never sends the confirmation code. Multiple attempts and multiple reinstalls. Have no access to my account,1
Posting makes no sense now. I was able to go through my folders while posting before and now I can't they're just all added to this one folder that makes no sense and doesn't have all of my images.,1
"Hi , I have just upgraded to the fold 4 and wen i watch reels on the front screen i have noticed that in some reels have of the portion is getting cut . I have checked on the fold 3 as well which my friend uses and even he is faving th3 same issue . Can u pls look into it .",1
Many glitches it has become irritating üò§ instagram losing its values now cheap app performance delay notification in messages and message doesn't appear in the chat suddenly,1
App has continued not to work the past 2 days won't even allow me on it every time I open the app all I get is a black screen and I have tried everything possible to resolve it. Contacting Instagram is impossible STILL NOT WORKING AND NO ONE RESOLVING ISSUE STILL 28-7-22 a month later,1
"the ease it takes to accidently follow someone bc ig sticks suggestions all over the place and if there is a lag loading, whoops you're following a stranger. or an ex. üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ trash ui",1
"Everytime I open the notification bell icon to adjust the settings, it just suddenly crashes. I had to open the app again and yet still the same.",1
"This app always has something wrong with it. Now the comments are not loading at all on any post. This is ridiculous, fix your app please.",1
"This isnt what iv been useing for 2years this gets worse every update it freezes every time i open the app and the reels take 50 years to upload even when i scroll down for reels it freezes but the audios still working this app is geting on my nervs i would rather use twitter and facebook , this is absolutely ridiculous i use to love this . Ima delete this app until i have some good news about it .",1
"Many of the times i try to post short video it can't uploading, post loading so many hours 10+hours ,i face this issue many times it so irritating,",1
I have reported two times about the bugs but they didn't solve the issue... Very disappointed.,1
Its totally irritating ... From yesterday I can't see my own followers or following... I can't even see my own reels or any anothers ... I have been logged out and again logged in ...but yet the problem hasn't been solved,1
"The Instagram you know and love is gone. Gone are square photos to scroll through. All posts are now reels, which are often a clip of a picture, as these get more views. Stop trying to be tiktok because you're doing a naf job of it. Edit, THEYRE STILL NOT LISTENING. BRING BACK INSTAGRAM, because this app has become Instatok. Creators are only using videos because they're forced to.",1
"this app deserves no star.. I can't choose popular songs , reels don't play properly and they always show up on Facebook.. very terrible",1
"Wanna see what your friends post? Good luck! Every third post/story is an ad. Suggested pages trying to sell me things are pushed on me constantly. Oh and these ads that never end, half of them are scams or mlms! This isnt a social media app. It's a marketplace trying to sell you things you dont need. Also stop trying to make reels a thing.",1
"This app is useless, it is useless to update it, if I update it, then there is no option of music on post:",1
Post shows in screen and disappear immediately after open the app. App is not stable now a day's.,1
Needs more work when putting photos in stories. They get zoomed in even though you choose the pinch option,1
Instagram what's wrong is going on with you..? Reels section have so many glitches. Whenever I post a reel it doesn't work normally also when I tap to a reel it doesn't open the selected reel but it open other reel. Please work on it. Thanks,1
"There is a lot of problems faced during Last few days like no proper notifications at times.bugs,etc etc.. Plz try to solve theses problems quickly",1
"IG you're really pissing me off! STOP WITH THE SUGGESTED POSTS!! It's filling up my feed, I follow over 300 accounts & only see the same ones over & over again, causing me to unfollow becuz of the annoyance. Everytime I hit like on a post doesn't mean I want to keep seeing only their page or a suggested related post it's ridiculous. IG isn't a place for the underage so why sensor hashtags, it was a lot easier before to get likes and followers thru them, not anymore. Go back to what it use to be!",1
"HEY INSTAGRAM!!! you have a problem with scammers. There are tons maybe even throusands in the app. Please update the security and stop deleting people's accounts without permission. It's good and all but I have an issue. A friend of mine got her account hacked and her password was changed, she used her number on her account I believe. I tried getting her account back for her but someone else's phone number is on hers. Please send me an email to help",1
"ü§ÆI wanna give (-infinite) to this Worst app because, this app is not well optimised, filled with glitches, didn't work normally in dark mode, didn't supports to send music files, didn't supports floating window feature, didn't have feature to stop auto play videos & pause option, consumes internet data too much....ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ",1
There is a very bad glitch... In this glitch a person in a chat is shown active but actually the person is not... Please fix it...,1
No support and response from the team. There is no option to recover deleted reels from drafts once account the got logout or reinstalled.,1
"I dont know what the problem is, but for the past few days the app is not loading on my phone. It looks like a bad network where the loading icon appears for everything, but the network is fine. Tried reinstalling many times and the issue persist. The lite version works just fine. I cannot even access the help centre from the app. Hope I get a solution.",1
When we change the highlights cover photo then it takes loading for an hour and while loading we can not use this app ....,1
"I don't know whats happening, I can see notifications but when I click them the messages don't appear, and I have to reload the screen for the messages to apear, and I can't even look back at my old messages either",1
This app is so annoying I can't even send a message on a private account I can't even create a new account and send message he's up I'll be so frustrating I will stop using this app because I see no reason on installing the app installing new one and still having the same issues let me push it right walk on you upgrade in your app because the app is frustrating my life,1

"Instagram either has no sense of who is a scammer and who is not, or are themselves trying to scam their users. The number of ads have just blown up in the last few months and are all of these pathetic ""get rich quick"" investment scammers. Despite reporting and hiding them hundreds of times. They still appear. There are zero ads of my interests and now it seems my feed has less of what people postt, but rather what these scammers want. Really, really pathetic Instagram.",1
Broken in more ways than one. Takes forever to switch between back and front camera. Missed an important moment in that time. And that's how the app performs on a Snapdragon 855+,1

The reels is cool and all but if I want to grow I have to play by the AI's game its dumb. Be instagram and be different. This app disappoints me now and is just too much and it's becoming toxic.",1
Data is not loading on the app. Can't open chats and no posts are loading. Please look into this issue.,1

"You ruined it with reels and algorithms. This used to be a great app to look at photos from artists, friends, but now you want to be TikTok clone. You're pushing reels from strangers onto us we don't care about. We don't want to make videos. Plus most of the reels are from TikTok. By doing this, you are hurting artists. Our work is not being seen to our followers, clients, friends and potential clients and business followers. Please revert back to the normal Instagram.",1

Hey Instragram i have one complete I have hacked my account and when I try to return then they ask for login code and I don't have it. And I have also posted face video on Instagram many times and I have also sought help on Instagram but Instagram is not working.,1
Can't log in at all its just a blank screen. Haven't been able to login for a few weeks now due to this. Edit: It's been about over a month now of a blank login screen. Been having to use the browser and pc version which is annoying. :/,1
It pretty much bugs out all the time. It's usually something different too. It's really freaking annoying. Downloading and re-downloading doesn't even do anything either.,1
"Suddenly the explore page turns into some posts about photography and art. Where are my usual explore page, this has happen more than twice and this time is the longest the explore page stays in this weird state..",1
Terrible! They remove my account because I don't exist!? as well as few other reasons and I checked the rules and it seems that I didn't break any not only that but I can't seem to make a new account!?,1
I have been continuously sending a message to Instagram help regarding the updation of the app but no changes have been seen so I'm greatly disappointed,1
Unsafe App. No Security. One can create a fake account with someone else data and photos. Anyone can create a fake account by using anyone's profile photo & later on ask for money. Useless Social Media Platforms like Instagram & Facebook.,1
Pictures don't even load anymore unless I close out of Instagram all together and go back into the chat. I uninstalled the app to see if I had to update it or if it was just some weird glitch and it's doing the same thing it did again.,1
This app is okay but at the time of theme They are not updated in mine but all of use insta they have themes in their chat but I have not.......please give me new theme Its now have been 1year to make my account but I have not updated my instagram account please try to be understand its gonna so hurted me always I delelted instagram everytime for only for this but I have addicted to thats why I am downloaded again and again but this time i am very angry that glictches also came and its mood off,1

I have a bug regarding reaction emoji ..it's been months i have reported .i have re-installed and updated app many times ..but still i have bug,1
Progressively gets worse and worse. Keeps forcing stuff you don't want to see into your feed. Recommending other people's random posts to you. Now it's showing old content like the local theater's movie times from a month ago. Absolute trash social media.,1
"Since the latest update, your app won't allow me to log in. No point in keeping it if I can't use it.",1
There are lot of bugs. While shifting to reels from homepage the song or audio is very echoed. And if we are seeing any reel in our profile random reels plays. Please fix this issue.,1
"one word, worse. This update is worse than ever! I can't open my Instagram at all. You all, the developers, better fix this before many people leave Instagram and switch to another app. I'm still hoping there will be new update that fix the problem for Android users. If not, then better prepare for the end. With all my respect, Instagrams' user",1
My app opens and then goes to a black screen and even will glitch between dark and light mode at the same time its a constant thing and this app definitely needs a big fix as many others are saying also!!!,1
"Suggested reels from people I don't follow have taken over my feed, and there are often 2 ads between each friend's story. I'm tired of missing things that are time sensitive bc the feed isn't chronological anymore.",1
"This app used to be good but now what my feed has turned into is just porn essentially. Every couple of pictures/videos are just women either fully naked or showing their breasts. Can't even open the app in public in case that is what first appears on my feed. Yet Instagram aren't doing a thing about it, i have been reporting each video and I have yet to hear anything back about it. Fix this so I can properly use the app.",1
"Please let me add text to post. It must be a bug, because when I try to post, it posts without description please fix soon.",1
All of a sudden just can't login the username doesn't exists tried logging in with email Id and phone number getting a message try again later.,1
"Instagram has become horrible these days, all of my phone's battery is draining, even if I don't use this app, my usage shows more time than I actually used. Idk why is this happening, never faced this kind of thing before!!! Plz fix this. I can't use this app for more than 1 minute bcz my my phone is getting switched off and the only app I'm running is Instagram, thanks..",1
This is the only app in the world that just stops working everytime it needs an update. The updat is forced down. Like wth?,1
Was good when I was able to see all posts in chronological order. Now I miss my friends' updates as IG is using some stupid algorithm for their own benefit,1
"Considering that you can see my last review, now it is even worse. It's not just about unoriginal content, but BASIC FEATURES are requiring a lot of patience, such as story publishing, profile picture changing, feed updating and other.. lame 15/10/22: CAN NOT EVEN SEND MESSAGES WITHOUT AN ERROR!",1

"Due to recent events of this app, I had to change to a 1 star. Many of my friends and even my significant other had their accounts wrongfully terminated. This app can support spam bots and adult content flying under the radar but delete creators trying to build their communities. Even business accounts. Plus, there is no way to contact instagram directly. Meta really has no regard for anything but money. Absolutely disgusting.",1
Explore page constantly resetting. These last few updates have been making this app unusable.,1
"Reels, musics, theame, different reactions aren't available reply to a particular text isn't possible please help in improving this within 48 hrs. This wasn't expected form instgram........ I have reported bug 2-3 times no action has been taken.",1
My account was compromised & support was close to zero. The buttons literally don't work when I submit the original email...,1
Tiny on 14 inch chromebook screen. Phone sized. It worked fine on my 10 inch ONN tablet. It's got no settings for size.,1
"Terrible. I have so much to say. However, it does not allow me to access all my photos, nor showing the option for which folder in my photos. I CANNOT post. The whole purpose of this app and I can't even do it.",1

"Giving one star because I don't now what's wrong with my Instagram,, I am not receiving text nor sending because everytime I open it turns blank and black out so disappointed üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†",1
It's such a pathetic experience to use this app. Instagram is no more it used to be. This newer versions can no more handle so much of what Instagram is trying to put across thru single app. But atleast basic usage shouldn't be disturbed. But unfortunately it is not delivering even that much. Disappointed.,1
Don't update! I was having issues posting multiple pictures so decided to update the app. Now it's only recognising photos in my gallery from 4+ weeks ago and doesn't recognise any videos. The app has become completely useless.,1
Something is wrong and I cannot contact the support. I cannot use the app at all. Please contact me or fix the issues ASAP,1
Honestly used to love it but now it has logged me out and when ever i try to open the app it will just sit there and load. And it never stops.,1
Worst experience feed isn't loading complained more than 20 times but nothing happened no changes. The technical support services is terrible,1
There seems to be glitch when ever I try to refresh my notification bar... It just keep buffering there isn't any update on recent likes or comments on my post,1
Instagram is not working properly after i have updated the app. I hope to solve my issue and clear my concern as soon as possible,1
Annoying extra space at the bottom of the screen when using gestures. App force closes when opening a recommended post.,1

"Recent update is terrible, post are not refreshing even stories are not refreshing Before i used to get stories from people i watch more but now it's totally unorganised,",1
"The ads are getting out of control. Seems to me that every second or third image is of an ad. It's getting to the point that I'm spending less time using it. Just watch The Social Dilemma - it's pretty damning of IG, and it's actually true. Now they have copied TikTok and everything I hate about that has been brought over to IG.",1
Worst app. It hangs alot. Damn with the update. It sucks. Takes forever to load new story and reels.,1
"Stupid worthless app, I tried posting a series of fun photos for my friends but got restricted because I ""posted too much"" this app is trash, don't waste space on your devices",1

"Hate Instagram cropping pictures when a group of pics is posted. It is a horrible user experience to have your pictures ruins by auto cropping Hate when posting a group of pictures, the GUI keeps jumping and adjusting away from your folder you are trying to select pictures from",1

"Used to be a decent app, but lately barely even functional. Now I can't even post at all anymore because of some glitch, what's the point.",1
I hate this app. It keeps on blocking my account without reason and I'm done trying to reactivate it just to let them block it again.,1
Every time I open this app the screen is blurred out. I have to uninstall and re-install the app every day just to view. This is getting old. This has been going on for weeks now. Update: Currently reinstalling as I type this message for the 4th time today to view anything. üòíüòí,1

"Worst app ever. You have to be logged in to see anything. The interface is terribly designed.

The latest update ruined the app. They basically turned it into TikTok only worse. It's impossible to see photos from artists and craftspeople which is what made the app good in the first place. Hopefully another app comes along that can be what Instagram used to be. Very unfortunate.,1
"No option for hide story-hide post-hide reels from someone or some people. So many bugs, no smooth access, hanging problem in this app, take more time to load stickers, emoji, images or create a story or reels. Sometimes sound removed from post, reels.",1
"Had my account after 4 years and 10.2k followers deactivated out of the blue. They have made it practically impossible to get a review to have it reactivated. Every time you fill out the form and click send, it asks to login to Instagram to prove your identity. How the hell can you do that if it's deactivated??? So mad!!!",1
After updating it to latest version facing many bugs and glitches. Not functioning properly.,1
Dear intagram please take notice there are many people that are complaining that instagram is not running I log out of my account from couple of days back but when I am again trying to log in it is just showing me a blank white screen instead of the log in page. What the hell is this many people are reporting to you the same issue for about 3 to 4 months but you've not taken any notice what is this behaviour. Such a pathetic service.,1
"I've only had the app for about 2 weeks. I paid for a subscription to a creator and instagram removed it with no explanation at all. They have NO customer service. I cancelled my account and deleted the app. If this is how they treat users of their app, I don't need it.",1
"Sometimes when I want to reply on DMs the keyboard covers what I'm typing. In order to fix it, I have close the app and enter again but it happens 90% of the time. It's really annoying. Please fix it.",1
In my phone my insta is not working it shows that something went wrong please try again I am unable to send messages nor I can see any reels from past two days,1
"I don't know what happened but the quality of all my pictures turned to rubbish, I don't know if it's a bug or what but hope it can be fixed ??",1
"This version of Instagram is the worst . The previous version was the best. You can't really re-mention those who've mentioned you and you can't download your own story the way the previous version allowed us to do. It's immensely disappointment. It's not even worth of 1 star. It's worth of 0.1 star. Please , give us a version which doens't cause any problem . IT'S A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT AND DO FIX THIS INSTEAD OF IGNORING ALL OF THESE FEEDS.",1
Keeps closing when selecting reels from my account. Even after update. Galaxy s22 Ultra. Unusable...,1
"Videos, boomerang, photos coming on Instagram Chats (DMS) are not being saved in the gallery, please tell me any solution for this problem üòë",1
"The app only shows black screen after the Instagram start logo. Not sure what's the problem, tried many times installing it, cleared cache and storage data but no luck. Uninstalling it, please create a jira for this and let me know once it is done.",1
"I have reported several spam accounts for sending porn links. Instagram has refused to remove every single account that I have reported for this. They state that these accounts have not viloated their community guidelines. Translation: Instagram condones and encourages the spamming of pornography to minors. If this isn't a class action lawsuit waiting to happen, then I don't know what is. I'll be sure to pass this along to an agency that would be more interested in accountability",1
"i beyond love this app, scrolling through post after post. wasting my life away swiping through reels, seeing what's going on in other's life. but yknow what i hate? how laggy this app is. how it crashes on my brand new phone everytime i go off of my feed. it's super annoying and fills me with unbridled rage. because what's the point of even having an app if it doesn't even stay open?",1
What is happening this app doesn't work smoothly while I am using this app suddenly it doesn't response and app closes and I back to my app screen .,1
I can't sign up.. I connected it to my Facebook then keep on pressing sign up but nothing happens.. or sometimes is says try again later üò°,1
The app is not working at all!!! I don't know what's the problem. I have tried every solution available but everytime I run the app I only see a black screen that lasts forever.,1
My insta acc was hacked 3 days ago ...tere is no response from Instagram from last 3 days .... providing low level security... very unsatisfied...i wish there were option to rate zero star,1
"No stars would be more appropriate. Got a new phone, can't login in my account anymore. Instagram doesn't send the text message to verify the account. Can run in circles trying to figure it out. And good luck getting any kind of support. Welcome to Facebook's metaverse I guess.",1
"Please Add speed play option or forward option in reels or video,when we have to hear last line of the video or something then we have to watch whole video ü§¶",1
Over a month now since I've been able to use the app. Can still use the browser but it sucks. I give up at this point. New updates do nothing. Some communication even acknowledging the issues would be nice.,1
I mistakly log out my account and I can't remember my password As I was trying to log in back it will said an error occur that I should wait for some minutes and if I try it in the next 30 minutes it will still say the same thing it has been 3days that have been trying it but it still say the same thing I hope u help me do something about it,1
"Unable to upload and edit reels. The app gets crashed again and again while editing (especially while adding music)!! Tried logging in via multiple devices, updated the app too yet the Problem persists!",1
"Updating my review due to a new issue: where are my reels? Instagram mysteriously deleted one from my feed, I recovered it under ""Recently Deleted"" even though I didn't intentionally delete it, then it reappeared in my profile. It doesn't violate any guidelines. 2 weeks later it disappears from my profile again, yet I still receive likes and comment notifications on it...I just can't view it myself.",1
I have had insta for such a long time I love it sm I'm just a teen so I use it 24/7 lmao but I uninstalled it then reinstalled it cause I was getting annoyed with social media then when I opened the app it was a black screen it didn't even let me log in or anything just black so idk I've tried literally everything like 100s of things and absolutely nothing works its wack and I haven't been able to use it for like a month or 2,1
"It does not gives update on me id. Reply features no available, themes of chat are not there,high quality posts option not available.",1
It shows tht ig is facing crashes and doesn't work at all. I did everything to solve this problem. Uninstalled and installed again. Cleared my mobile storage etc.. No positive result. Wht should I do anynore. I can't even open it. It's terrible,1
What's going on with Instagram i can't even post stories and sometimes the app stop working and i can't even open it..,1
So bad app my message reply feature is not working and i submit so many tines in help centre but the instagram is not solving anything.,1
"The app stops working when I try to add music to a video. So many updates yet persisting glitches. And why do my already posted reels show up in the drafts? EDIT: Why is it now difficult to read comments via the filter feature in my notifications? üò≠ My posts have comments, but I don't get notified. I only find the comments by going to the comments section. Why do the dps of the accounts I'm replying to in my reels disappear after a few days of being in the drafts? Instagram, please fix these üôè",1
"I haven't been able to post this week, as the whole thing is veey buggy, particularly when I try to write captions",1
Security is completely rubbish as I have been and still have my Instagram account and.feed being hacked. Do better!! False advertising my assuring people they can be online in a secure fashion as outlined in your ToC...wouldn't even give a star rating if possible,1
Soo bad after updates instagram doesn't even work that's why i don't update instagram and after updates there are soo many glitches and bugsü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è please fix it or else instagram will be trash,1
"Why does it have trouble loading photos? I can't view posts. I keep on reinstalling the app and every time I log out and log back in, the same problem occurs. I tried using my computer's browser to use Instagram and it's all fine..",1
The app has to many problems i dont really like the new update that when we post a video it converts in reel this is the baddest update,1
Way too many ads while watching stories plus you can't pause a video either and many more,1
"After the new update ,I swear the instagram sucks,as when i open reels its freezes-(the video doesn't play).",1
There is glitch in the app when i try to upload reel its getting auto rotation upside down please fix this lot of people are facing the same issue,1
"Instagram does very little to protect users from scammers. Once you have been defrauded there is no channel of reporting that fraud. I was scammed and I was posting on the scammers page trying to warn people, but Instagram blocked me from posting for 3days where I was the victim in this case. I couldn't find a button that allowed me to appeal my case and within those 3days I couldn't post the scammer made more post and defrauded more people. I think Instagram isn't doing enough to protect.",1
"*STOP TRYING TO TURN INTO TIKTOK* Ruined a good app/platform. Every update brings more rubbish features to slow it down & ruin the exp. Crashing, buggy, glitches euth filters. Videos not loading/,playing.. trash app now. Most new posts on big accounts are a sea of thot-bots for the top 50 comments. This is the only remaining social media platform I use as I deleted the others for going the same route. One step closer to having none üëè",1
Oh My god Literally I'm very very very disappointed üòûüòû because I'm lots of time report my problem but still my request is not accept my Request is I Have not swipe option also theme option it's to difficult to chanting without swipe option All is Good for this app but still Things to all without swipe option and also theme option I'm very disappointedüòû so I will give you only one star I'm lots time request you but your not accept it so I have no option,1
I have seriously been getting many issues on this stupid app!!! Now for some reason whenever I see other ppl stories is auto speeding skipping stories on its own & stopping at certain stories. Not giving me time to take a look at the other stories. DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PLS???,1
Cannot save or download story with music. Very dissapointed. Great if enable access to download üòëüëç,1
"Im facing a problem with watching reels. It always shows reels with less views and like which are not even good and sometimes it shows like ""wew are sorry,but something went wrong"". I really hate this app. Worst",1
The fact that we can't change our name twice in 14 days is the worst update ever !!! Please work on it and remove it because its so useless !!!,1
"Not functioning properly. When viewing stories, it skips past a lot of them without me pressing anything. I also can't open any links in people's bio. Please fix",1
I'm a real person and Instagram doesn't publish my posts and may photos. This is against freedom of expression.,1
After last update it works for 2-3 seconds and stops working after that. Tired now,1
This app acting weird from last 2 weeks and I don't understand what these developer team is doing. This reported 3 time. But still no updte,1
"Post the new update, there is just too much lag, and now the app doesn't even open. Its just a blank screen. More annoying than runtime error.",1
Instagram rolled my most viewed video in to My Activity. Glitch all the time and when i post something It doesn't post captain and hashtags. worst experience. Also they aren't cooperate in. They didn't answer my any report. I reported them so many times. üò°üò° Also keep reducing my followers so much. Instagram is discouraging people. Just promoting brands and celebritiesüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüò°üò°üò°üò°,1
"Edit: I tried installing recently, it's worse with more ads than before.... it's even worse now. Original review: Frustrating, random ordered posts. I love the content makers, the artists I follow are truly talented. However, whenever I got into the app, the order which things are posted on the app is so hectic, it changes the order of things RANDOMLY, and posts even DISAPPEAR if you clicked it.",1
Update won't fix bugs. I can't seem to get the updated version with reels anymore. I haven't been able to use the app properly for months. At this point it's not even worth having anymore.,1
"Can't even log in, the forced connection between Facebook and Instagram makes it incredibly annoying for people without Facebook",1
"So now, when attaching a song to a reel, when it posts, it has a lovely audio of just static. I then uninstalled and reinstalled the app... TWICE... Same issue.",1
For some reason my insta camera would suddenly turn on without me touching the camera in the first place. The app security seems fishy/suspicious to say the least.. not sure if insta is that easily bypass by hackers,1
The explore couldn't refresh the feeds since yesterday. Please solve and fix my problem as soon as possible.,1
My ID is not working properly in my Samsung s22 ultra but in my old phone is working so I am confused phone glitch or app. Fix it,1
"Clicking on story highlights, and it's showing nothing, no images etc.",1
"I just log out my acc and it turns out to white screen, I can't log in my acc again because its all white. I've tried may times to restart my phone and reinstall this app but it doesn't work. I also tried to open the website of this app in my browser and it's working but my acc can't open, it says ""There was a problem logging you into Instagram. Please try again soon."" But my other account can open. Please handle this immediately ü•∫",1
"UGH. I can't like anything after I started getting these weird banning notifications and for no reason, I did not increase my likes! My account is private!!!",1
This is ridiculous. Why I have to put password everytime I log in. I click on save password but again at the time of login I need to put password!!! Fix this Instagram ASAP,1
"Absolute trash, cant get back into my because the 2 factor authentication doesnt even send me a code to login again.",1
"it's hard to create new account, it's always says that it's having a hrd time recognizing the email or sometimes it's always says to eait for a few minutes.",1
"Instagram is allowing porn by adults and children, supporting races crime videos. Don't even bother reporting it because u will have 12 more show up and NOTHING WILL GET DONE ABOUT IT. It use to be a really cool place... Now, it's garbage.",1
"Whats the matter with yu all....when i already have the app ,why am i being forced to watch ur ads and redirected to this page constantly.....forcing sth in our faces is not going to help you....take this 1 star from me hence",1
Overall this app is good algorithm also doing well...but Instagram suspend my account three times without any reason this is not fair believe me..,1
Absolutely terrible. Two Step authentification is broken and now I'm completely locked out of my account. They're literally not sending me the text to confirm my account and the email they send does absolutely NOTHING. Beyond angry with the incompetence.,1
"I'm facing buffering issue from a very long time, tried everything possible, but failed...please fix this problem asap...Again I'm facing the same issue, my internet connection is perfect.. And i can use other apps like before.. But Instagram...ughhh please fix thissssss...",1
"Anytime, It is being Stop from developer. Try to get small size app., It I very big sized application.",1
"Absolute rubbish can't edit multiple pictures, will only edit 1st picture and apply same edit to the restüò°",1
"There is lot of glitch in instagram app, i had also mailed to instagram but not getting any reply and also they are not fixing the glitch.. Major glitch : - I'm not able to post sometimes, it's seem error ""Try again"" multiple time in a row - Professional dashboard is not working properly, when i try to get the dashboard of 7 day or 14 days it's just close the whole app",1
App won't load. Just opens up to a black screen. Can't log in. Can't do anything. Deleted and reinstalled. Deleted cache and data. It's just completely unusable.,1
"it's constantly bugging when making posts with multiple images or god forbid you want to post a video, it's impossible, and now to top it off, it's not letting me log in any way i try it, or to change the password.",1
"I use Instagram a long time but now since some weeks i cannot open or use it , it show me the Instagram logo and then went black that's all the time, uninstall and install doesn't make an difference neither to restart the phone helps, i have to use Instagram web app to be able to use Instagram please fix that problem immediately!",1
What the hell is going on here. üòÖ The remixed reels has more views and liked than original ones.,1
Scrolling through reels and only 1 out of 5 would play and the rest are just frozen. I've uninstall and reinstalled but it might be a general bug. Hope it gets fixed soon.,1
"Every other post is an ad and this idiotic algorithm shows you 10 accounts in total on ""news""feed. Just ridiculous...",1
"algorithm is soo messed up , it keeps on showing the same thing even after you report it as not interested.",1
Stop with the useless and ugly updates no one asked for. My explore page is filled with reels which are just basically a cheap version of TikTok atp and my explore page never shows posts that I actually like it's all makeup and random stuff,1
"Now i cant find music, when i want to search a song the app not find it, but the same song its is used by others users, i can't put to story a post in wich i was tag üò¢. I uninstall the app 30 times and still nothing. For samsung the app it dosen't work like it did befor the updates",1
The latest update has a bug in which you can't upload reel on your story. And saying couldn't upload 'try again' every single time. I have also complaint multiple times in last 3 days for the same. But no response. So fix this ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÉ,1
"No Safety. So many fake profiles of Scammers. Boys are using this app only for sexual affairs. I don't think this app is for talented people or for people who need a break from busy schedules. It's only for boys to find girls for their needs, for scammers & for celebrities promotions. There is no option for ""who can download a video"" anyone can download it with unknown app. Only two options either private or public. It means public profiles won't have safety. Only private profiles can have. Why?",1
My Instagram doesn't load or open. All I get is a blank white screen. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it. Also turnt my phone off and factory reset. Yet nothing is working.*13/082022 still blank screen and no reply from developers. Seems there are a few unhappy people.,1
Couldn't add my other accounts. It keeps popping up the username doesn't exist. Like man I've been using those accounts for 5 years,1
What has happened to this app. You can't click on any links which sucks. My favorite accounts say they aren't getting seen any longer. Stop messing with the app and just leave it alone. Stop changing things! It used to be my favorite but you are killing it.,1
"Ok so nobody needs to go in to Pornhub anymore, all of it now is included in Instagram. You can't open Instagram when you're around family and friends, because there's literally so much nudity everywhere of half naked women. I have tried reporting this type of content several times, but they just keep coming back. Thank youüôÇ",1
I am unable to react on any messages and there is no option for changing theme.. I am unable to reply for any specific msg. Hope these things will fix soon..,1
"It's genuinely awful - god knows how to navigate through it, but that doesn't matter cos it crashes, no exaggeration, every single time I've used it today. Well done Zuck, it seems like you weren't losing cash fast enough already.",1
"Worst Support System It's downright impossible to reach someone through their app or on their site. My account was temporarily locked due to a ""phishing"" attempt, which was just me using a third party app to get rid of bots following me, I was unable to retrieve the code to confirm my identity and now I'm in Instagram limbo, can't access my account, can't do anything on the app, can't reach support. What am I supposed to do now? Get a new phone? Ridiculous, just what you get for meta-monopoly.",1
I cant reply to certain messages and instagram keeps changing my music to a different region/cultural music I don't understand.,1
Thanks to Meta I have been forced out of my Instagram account due to whatever they have done which has caused me to not be able to log in. Upon trying to recover my account it only made things worse and they have made it virtually impossible to recover it. They need to fix Instagram all the way around and make it possible for others like me to reclaim our accounts due to their inadequacies.,1
"Instagram app isn't opening. all i can see is white background, i waited for hours but it didn't change. i have a stable connection and storage space so i don't know why it's not working. please fix this.",1
"If you don't wanna make an app for Android, please just remove this. It's full of bugs never works smoothly",1
I tried everything but my account is not getting removed from temporary locked state i havenot updated my email and phone number from long time. I tried via facebook too . But nothing is changing. why it is happening and there is no customer support regarding it please look forward to see the situation.,1
"Unable to refresh feed or send images. Don't know why, but posts won't load but I can see that some one posted something. My dms of images are loading forever but I have wifi and text dms go through. This is a new problem for me",1
Instagram is so Buggy I can't login/reset password in my Redmi mobile miui 13.0.4 version both from app as well as browser. Recent days so many bugs in Instagram,1
This App Is Getting Worse Than Ever After Updating It Not Able To Change DP Not Able To See DM's Not able able to share stories to like it goes on buffering forever if I try to share stories Or something and there's a glitch when I watch reels the audio comes double every time want to get it fixed,1
"Ever since the update and most recent crash , I haven't been able to use the app at all . Everytime I try to open the app it shows the logo then just shows a blank screen . I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling , resetting my phone , clearing data and cache resetting my phone to factory settings and nothing . It's been like this for a week . And nothing has been done at all",1
"the app won't open , it's just a black screen . I tried uninstalling , reinstalling , clearing cache , clearing storage , everything . Still just a black screen . Bad app .",1
"Bots are ridiculous. Every other comment on a post by a user with a lot of followers is a bot. Nothing has been done or even addressed since the bots took over. Video posts also will randomly not load or just freeze in the middle of the video. This happens at least every other video, i have to scroll away then scroll back for the video to maybe work",1
I can't use themes and other options like reply and all from my id I looked in it but still didn't got any solution And number of bugs keep increasing .....,1
"Out of nowhere the app claims I'm suspended, despite the fact that I never post. I try to argue it, it wants me to do a captcha which I pass, verify my email with a code which I do, and now demands my number, all without telling me why I'm suspended. It's almost certainly a scam to collect your info and sell to scammers for a quick buck.",1
1 star because I can't even open the app. It stops working right after I click open the app.,1
I want to delete this app but as a social media manager I can't. Let me tell you they don't make it easy to enjoy the platform. Glitchy and so so hard to get reels and posts seen now. I used to get 5k views on a reel and now I'm lucky to get 200. It's a very demoralising app,1
a lot of problems popped up like I can't post a picture or video properly it keeps showing the same image in everything,1
The app keeps closing out on me I can hardly get post up and I run a business.,1
Recently I have faced many problems in Instagram like it's only showing a black screen . It's been a month since I installed and uninstalled this app but it's not opening.,1
"Just fed up with this new updat, if i choose the latest following list option it shows the same earliest following list. So many glitches in this new update.",1
"The app is crashing, it can't load the posts and all photos on the feeds, even on own profile. PLEASE FIX THIS, IT'S BEEN 5 DAYS. however the error is not visible to apple devices only on Android devices.",1
Won't let me upload videos. Even on webbrowser. I've used wifi and Mobile data. I have fast internet connection. So it's not my internet. I think I've been blocked from posting videos.,1
This new version brings some bugs of try again later can u please update the Instagram app and remove it. Thank u,1
"I don't know what's going on, I was logged out of Instagram since yesterday and up till now I can't log in any of my accounts and I tried to open a new one all to no avail please Instagram help me cause I don't know what's going on",1
"How is it, that I write a review on the 24/5/22 about the dark mode being super buggy, and today in Dezember it still isn't changed at all? And the alogrithm still sucks.",1
Everything FB touches is just... Few weeks now cannot load or edit photos. The whole point of this applications is those things and there are always errors and nothing can be uploaded?!,1
"Fix your app it doesnt want to load and just shows a blank screen whenever i try to use it. I cant log in, see messages or anything lots of peoppe are experiencing the same thing..FIX IT!!",1
Literally i am facing a lot of problems after downloading the latest update available. I am unable to see the new posts.,1
There are so many bugs in this app. Whenever I open this app I am greeted with a blank white screen. Very bad Instagram team... I am not able to access instagram from last 2-3 weeks. So many people have complained but still the team is not doing any thing.. Very pathetic performance...,1
Number of bugs after updating the app or its not able to work properly after the finish of data,1
I put a pic in my close friend's and now peoples who r not in my close friends list is replying itt. Very badd..the app is getting worse and worse by updates...now i can't put videos in my stories..the first part of 15 sec get uploaded but the rest is showing couldn't upload,1
Not giving a bouns opportunity again after the first one. I need at least one payout before ill even consider a higher rating. You want a good review then maybe do better by content creators.,1
"I wake up, check my phone and I see that instagram banned my account for ""violating terms"" when i hadn't even done anything wrong. I decided to make a new account but now I can't access reels and my phone software is up to date the app is up to date but I still can't see it. I even restarted my phone a few times but it's the same thing.",1
"I can't use the app anymore, it shuts down right after I start it. My phone model's xiaomi redmi note 8 pro. It started today, I updated the app, signed out of my accounts other than my personal one, reinstalled the app, rebooted my phone, and none worked.",1
I can't open my Instagram. It's showing black screen while open it. I tried to clear the cache and data but nothing happens. I also restarted my phone multiple times. Please fix this. I can't rely on Instagram lite,1
So sad using bot to recheck real ppl that using ig for longtime useless new update ever and sms system broked too. Being like this I guess ppl in this app will move to other.,1
My page @aliciacinnamon was diasbled almost 6 months ago and i cant gain access to it.

"Still getting a black screen after removing/installing app. Cant open it, it just opens a black screen with nothing - no buttons/icons. It used to work before, not now. Sigh",1
It's literally so annoying how apps like Instagram tailor their user interface to iphones. Giving them perks and capabilities they don't give android it's stupid,1
Horrible experience. Whenever I go to create a reel the sound is deleted and replaced with loud static noise. EVERY TIME! so annoyed.,1
"The app was ok but now it completely messed up, i wanted to log into a new acc, i have just 2 and decided to delete one, but there was no delete acc options and used the app through google website, i deleted the acc but for some stupid reason jt logged me out of my man one that is icedraws11, i tried to log, uninstall it, refresh it, the wifi is perfectly strong, and nothing, and when i made it log in through email, but the screen stays white for 2 hours or the app kicks me out, please fix it",1
"I've uninstalled it because of reels. I sometimes use it in the browser because there i dont get reels. There's no denying the addictive nature of this stuff and I have to protect myself. No matter how good the recommendation algorhythm is, a binge scews it away from the creative content i originally downloaded it for and fills it with junk. Addiction is real, you want as many eyes on screens for as long as possible, so there's no way i trust you to keep an environment that stimulates creativity",1
"If i start viewing a reel, the app crashes. Now that reels have taken up a majority of the app infrastructure, it's difficult to browse through anything.",1

"Thought Instagram was to be an app where I can post cool pictures and see my friends cool pictures. Now it's just reels, reels, and more reels.. stop trying to be Tik tok and go back to being Instagram.",1
The tools to edit videos are nice but it's Meta so you kind of have to give them one star. Also targeted ads and data collection. Oh and ruining our young people with social media. Oh and trying to cover up the fact that there is research showing the awful things about social media. But that's none of my business. Enjoy moderately.,1
"It is not working on my phone, it is almost a week. My phone is samsung s10 and it didn't work. I tried to install and re install but not working. I hope they fix the issue",1

"""Glitch after glitch, you can't post multiple pictures as they are either duplicated or distorted & stuffed full of adverts. Instagram is a bore"" This was my post from many years ago. Its still won't post multiple pictures. You see more adverts than the people you watch. You get warnings about posts you did years ago, that aren't of any issue to anyone. Instagram spends more time telling you what they want you to see, pushing false narratives about covid etc. Change your name Insta brainwash",1
"Why have you added reels notifications that users cannot disable? Definition of spam. Ever since reels landed, IG seriously downgraded engagement, I really don't want tiktok. For some reason IG also wants me to shop - in an app for sharing pictures. Not to even mention all the porno spam. If I wanted to see other people's posts I would go to explore but now you even force this in my home feed. Forcing engagement gets less engagement from me. This app is crashing for classic monetisation fails.",1

The new algorithm stopped showing your friends, now you see 1-2 posts from people you actually want to see and the rest is sponsored content with too many ads.

"So many problems after the update. Every video is uploading as reel,effect option from my story is disappeared even after updating the app. Idk there's no other option. I hate the update.",1
"Updated review: Instagram has gotten so into their sponsored content that I often open the app to have the first post I see be a sponsored post. I get they need to make money, but let me see at least one post from someone I follow before you shove sponsored content down my throat. Previous review: They've added a pop-up forcing you to do a survey and if you don't, it'll keep popping up. Very annoying and shouldn't be forced on your users.",1

It's still active and I have no way to regain control ,thanks to the lack of help at the Instagram ""help center"". Thanks for nothing, IG",1
IG it's getting worst than ever.. shows pretty much only paid posts and popular ones regardless from where in the world.. random people posts which are more real and around me doesn't show.. supporting the fake lifetime more and more...,1
"I see more content from people I DON'T follow than from people I do follow. Stop the suggested posts. Stop the suggested accounts. Stop the suggested videos. I've marked ""not interested"" on every reel that shows in my feed. Why are there still reels? Where is the content I WANT? Update: now you're suggesting ADULT CONTENT to me and accounts SELLING DRUGS Update2: please stop the constant barrage of UNWANTED notifications",1
"The spam in messages, the spam profiles who see the stories, the amount of absolutely irrelevant advertising which is not only irrelevant but abusing too. The low quality content which is suggested to me. It was not always like this but the last 1 year I really want to delete this app.",1
This app no longer works.. Literally nothing on screen. It has completely stopped working.. No matter how many times I uninstalled and installed. It's very disappointing,1
Worst app ever because in my account emojis reaction not working and i reported 3-4 time but no response from Instagram team and updated Instagram many times but nothing solved.,1
"Tried to post unboxing video in reel, combined camera audio 100% with IG song 70%, it worked during editing, but after posted it, sound was noisy like radio no signal or heavy rain! HAPPENED ONLY ON ANDROID PHONE, TESTED 3 PHONES, PLEASE FIX THIS A.S.A.P! (IPhone works fine.)",1
When i used sort option to see whom i following the latest it shows me the same list. Doesn't update according to latest.,1

"Dont download it! Worst app ever i seen . So many glitches on camera and lots of bugs üò¨. I have no words for it. Worst , useless app!",1
Editing options and layout of buttons are not well placed. Using Samsung S6.,1
It's very distracting It's has very bad reels It's look like bold reels video I don't like it's It's follow Facebook I really hate these both apps It's very disgusting feel,1
I'm not able to access any of the photos on my device to post. The only photos I can choose are photos I have posted in the past. I've checked my permissions and the issue does not seem to be on my end.,1
"Sudden increase in ""suggested posts"" and surprise ads that suddenly pop up as you're looking at a post. Ridiculous.",1
After my account was hacked I've had the most unenjoyable expirence with Instagram. I have been trying to reach someone so I can get help to get into my account but nothing seems to work. I have decided to stop using anything that's facebook after I get this resolved sick and tired of Facebook.,1

This app is super buggy these days. Constantly closing reopening closing reopening. In fact? My device indicated the app has a bug and that the developer needs to fix it. How can this be fixed?,1

"The new update is atrocious! Instagram has always been a great, modern platform that allowed you to keep updated with photos from friends and celebrities. Well, not anymore! Instagram is apparently striving a little too hard to become TikTok and as a result it has made the app so displeasing to use. Seriously terrible update. I never see photos posted by friends in my feed anymore. Zero space between posts - super confusing to tell what is going on and reading captions has become impossible.",1
Okay so recently I'm having an issue a lot of ppl are following me on insta but my followers aren't increasing Instagram is a great app but I'm very much disappointed plss fix this issue!,1
"Recently my reels section stopped working and just before that it doesn't shows personalized reels and just showing reels with very few like 100,50,10 likes reels and also that I'm not interested in.

In my account notes option is not showing.... I don't know why please see the problem and solve it...... Thanku,1
No longer happy with this App. Purely just do it for memories for myself & my true followers. I have almost 13 followers and can't even get 200 likes on a reel in a 24 hour period. I feel like everyone is leaving this APP for TIK TOK. only reason I stay is I've invested so much time. I'm starting to spend more time on TIK TOK AGAIN. just not happy with this APP.,1
Everytime I like a reel it says i cant like because of safty reasons and i dont know how to change it. Im very dissapointed in this app.,1
"Soo glitchy I use the app on dark Mode and parts on the display go completely white,sometime the words disappear",1
I found an issue when comment on reels. the textboxt does not show when i wrote a comment. device: xiaomi poco x3 android: 11 instagram is the latest version,1
Instagram stories not viewing. If i view the stories the app is stop working and automatically app closed. What's wrong with the app today. Feeds are working only viewing the story the app suddenly stops and shows app is not responding,1
I had loved Instagram but of late not loving it. I am getting very little notification and no bell notification. I had message the meta company. All notification are on. Gave me YouTube video and advise to fix it. When I ask them can the give me a fix. Their only advise was get a new phone or live with it.,1
"Opens a blank screen, I have tried everything, I dont have battery saving on, I have cleard the cache and uninstalled / reinstalled but nothing is fixing the issue. I am running the latest version of Android",1
When will I have the feature of customized emojis on messages like whatsapp. I can only like messages. That's it. No other reactions,1
Not able to send message or receive eny message from when i have updated this app it is taking a lot of time to send message or receive it so please fix this,1
Idk what's wrong but it's not loading at all for 2 weeks in a row now.. pay a little attention to this app more than focusing all of it to Facebook,1
Crashing since two days and its showing something is wrong and wait for the update having bug fix from developer.But there is no update showing yet. Using instagram lite but it has less features. Disappointed,1
"App crashes everytime I try to open it. Tried deleting cache, closing and reopening the app, restarting my phone and it all doesn't work. Crashes on my Samsung s20+, but works OK on my note9",1
The app isn't working at all. I've tried a hundred times it just doesn't open. When i open it there is a completely blank screen idk what this is but I hope it is fixed soon.,1
"Used to be good for photos, now just another video streamer. Unfortunately resulting in people making reels for the sake of it with no added value from a photo. Not only that your posts get 10% reach if you do not post a reel a day.",1
"Hi Instagram, Out of frustration I am writing this review. The messenger settings are not updated in my Instagram app. I am using updated app. I have reported this issue numerous occasions in the app but there was no response from Instagram team. I didn't expect this from application like Instagram. So pity !",1
New low sunk. I am CONSTANTLY bombarded with bots liking and seeing my posts and stories and with messages from bots. I block so many bots and try to report as many as I can and nothing helps!!! FIX YOUR BOT ISSUE!!,1
These suggested posts are just stupid and also there's something up with your app the people that follow me have categories for least interacted with and accounts you don't follow but there's no categories for the people that I follow even tho there used to be one,1
"All of a sudden Search feed doesn't even load with satble network, unable to send or receive messages from mobile app",1
"I change my opinion about this app In 24 of May was introduced an update that doesn't split to 15 seconds every story, later the app was autoupdated itself, and disappeard this function. - Can you bring this back ? - Or there is any settings to change it ?",1
"There is just something with the app that pisses me off. Like when I am post a story but when I scroll to my gallery all I can see are just repeated pictures all over. Also when Im posting a Post, all I can see are white pics in my gallery and cant even click the multi post button.",1
"Trying to make reels is impossible, sometimes you will get to posting it and it will just disappear and the drafts gone too! Waste of time, plus editing reels is super glitchy",1
"Too many ads , click delete and it's all new come again . Escaping from Facebook but start many in Instagram again. üò•",1
"This platform is allowing anti-India as well as Hindu phobic content! Lots of misinformation is being spread using Instagram. The service quality of this application has deteriorated drastically! Videos get stuck, suddenly posts are lost and posts get reported maliciously! Please rectify all these! Also after the new update the videos are getting stuck! Please fix this issue!",1
"There is too much censorship regarding nudity and semi-nudity for an app gained most of its popularity because of thirst traps. The censorship has a heavy double standard against men especially, where plenty on non nudes have been taken down for allegedly being too explicit while many females get away much more explicit pix. I absolutely HATE having to sit through an entire video when I want to fast forward pause or rewind. And a loop option for videos woukd be great",1
This is not an app that they are showing it is a shopping app and sponsor app in reels section they are showing 1 reel and 10 shopping products complete waste of time and internet!,1
I have not been able to open this app for about the last 3 days. It starts to open and then it shuts itself down before I can see anything. Tried restarting my phone multiple times.,1
Instagram is not working since the previous update I hope. The screen goes blank aand blank as we open the app after the logo appears. Fix this... It still doesnt work after the recent update on 28th July 2022.,1
What's the deal with the feed? No updates for 4 days while my reels ribbon updates? Not a lot of fun to use,1
"While navigating from insta link shared on watsapp, different reel is being opened everytime I select the link. Kindly update",1
"So bad...when I tried signing up for my account it only says ""please wait a few more minutes"" like what is wrong...pls fix it soon.",1

"I've been using Instagram for years, and it's the first time I'm having problems with the app. When I sent a post to my friends, it used to be my most frequent contacts at the top, but now it's an old schoolmate I haven't been following for years and they haven't been following me either. It has become very inconvenient.",1

I can't reply single message like in whatsApp i just disabled my account for 1 day and now I am not able to reply single messages. Do something about it I made it 1 new I'd for it and now in that I'd too I can't reply .you know it's so confusing when I can't reply single reply to my friends in a group.

UPDATE Tried again to sign up for an IG account and got instantly banned...what on earth?!

"I am not able to record reels by my ipad, i am hating the app now, i have complained about it but this problem is not solved at all",1
"Without warning or reason, Instagram disabled then DELETED my Instagram creator account and my linked facebook of 10+ years citing I violated guidelines. I read the guidelines, there was no violation. I tried to contest by submitting a review and appeal only to find out that ""due to Covid19"" they are under staffed and won't be acknowledging complaints. This app is not customer centric. It just wants our data. It randomly deletes your accounts and there is NO CUSTOMER SERVICE.",1
"After few days of posting reels on Instagram, the music added to the reels was deleted by original content creator and reel has no sound or music. Please add editing option to the reel post, so that we can choose and add different music to the reel anytime.",1

When I select the app it comes on momentarily and closes by it self. Cannot get I to stay on. I uninstalled it and re installed it. Which seamed to sort the issue out. But issue reappeared shortly after.,1
Facebook strikes again. Not content to slowly ruin Facebook they're now determined to try to save their flagging brand by turning Instagram into Ticktoc and shoving a million unwanted videos in your face every second. Now they're trying to make me sign in via Facebook and won't recognise my actual password and email to Instagram. If anyone likes ANY other platform than them they buy it and destroy it. NEXT....!,1

I don't have message reaction feature and update messages option is not available and also themes are not available in my account. Please kindly solve this problem. Do needful for this as soon as possible.Still can't get this feature.‚òùÔ∏è Swipe message is still not working.,1
"I used to love this app but now 50% of my feed is ads and suggested posts, the upload quality is bad and for a photo app it does not allow to post images of different sizes in one series.. very poor and capitalist-based, rather than catering for the creatives where it all began",1
"There is a lot of problem with my Instagram ID, no such message has been sent to me on Instagram, which is against the guideline, please fix my messenger and my ID immediately. Plesse riview my id",1
'Error' pops up when saving a video or a reel. Reel lags. Cannot post reels.,1
It seems there's one rule for some and not others when it comes to breaching community guidelines. If you have a huge amount of followers Instagram turn a blind eye.,1
"please stop updating this for no reason, it's garbage. the updates are mostly cosmetic and make navigating the app more clunky. app auto updated and is now buggy. edit 17/10 messages won't sent to one specific person so i had to uninstall and restall",1
"Most buggy app ever. Your followers don't see you, impossible to run an ads, block for no reason. Impossible to submit review for appeal, because it shows an error ""something went wrong"".",1

"The app is very good, but after the update it has become very bad, I can't see any option while saving the story here, I can't reply to the messages, please fix them.",1
On my personal account I have the option to enable high quality media upload but not on my professional account. What kind of issue this is? I've logged in both accounts on same phone with latest app version so how can this happen? Just provide me a solution as soon as possible.,1
"Used to be good. Now they're trying so hard to become tiktok and forcing creators to make reels (by only promoting reels) even if it doesn't suit their content. It glitches frequently. Moderation is awful, some posts will be taken down for no valid reason while other posts that break the community guidelines are allowed to stay up. Instagram pls listen to your community and fix this hellhole of an app",1
My instagram is not opening from a week and i am now totally frustrated by your app . this is the worst experience i have ever had in my life . please solve this problem as soon as possible . whenever am trying to open instagram only white blank screen appears and nothing else. kindly solve this problemüôèüèª.,1

Terrible first time experience of using app uninstalled and reinstalled and same problem. Black screen only upon starting. won't be using or downloading until a better safer more encrypted version comes out. ü•¥üí©üëéüëé,1
Worst experience ever when ever i install this app fb open automatically even i dont have account on fb instagram need to be clear about there features otherwise i will delete my accountü§¨,1
"I used to enjoy using this app until recently...its not all inclusive, culturally blind, and are so selective as to what THEY want to show. And it take my videos forever to load now, whereas before my videos loaded immediately üòë. So disappointing.",1
The app keeps getting crashed am not able to use this app since the last 4 days ! I have tried every damn thing possible ! But still i am unable to stop the crashing the moment I open the app it gets crashed provide me a solution for this,1
"It was working very well in the start but it has slowed down alot lately, in recent months. Whenever I posted a story it shuts down. But now my account is not working at all on any device, since 4 days. It only shows my dms and no posts or stories of any person.",1
"My account has just been suspended, please help I haven't shared anything against the standards. I can't log in and it says user not found.",1
"Worst service by instgram about somedays, you should to do refresh many times during chatting otherwise you can't see incoming messages.",1
Please try to fix the problem since app is not working properly and as such videos are not playing nor I'm able to scroll down...,1
"When I click ""not interested"" on the same post or account 40 times, please take the hint. I don't know how or why this has become an issue of recent times, but Instagram would run so much better if this issue was fixed.",1
I had reported that i don't have reply option in my instagram message tab. But your team is not responding.,1
Cant update inbox byitself. I need to swipe to refreshh it every time because it shows old messages. Android a31,1
"It's trying way too hard to be like Tick Tock. You get to see like one or two people you follow posts, then it's all recommend videos and ads beyond that. Good luck trying to post anything that's not a video either. This app is not what it used to be.",1
"So after the new update insta has not be working for me, I could see the text coming in but I don't see it when I open the dm.",1
"This was my fave app. And I use it daily to post IG story. However, I don't know why suddenly, when I uploaded an IG story with text/words, the text became glitchy or distorted. I saw it on other storyies as well. Please fix this! This is so sad :(",1
So I have been using insta for some time now but recently my account has been hacked and ever since I have been raising an issue on the app and the support centre from the past week and not even a single reply back from them or the support . Really bad experience with insta on this basis the main aim of these kind of social app is the security part of it in which they are lacking behind need to sort this ASAP . Need a better support team and a response for such a big organization TOO BAD........,1
"New reel notifications multiple times super annoying, no way to toggle them off individually. Maybe make an option to turn it off before you start a new push notifications that drives everyone mad",1
"Instagram banned my account for ""violating their terms"" and won't state what I did that violated them. All I did was create my account and create a username, made no posts (couldn't) and now I can't use their platform and they have been non-responsive when I've contacted support. I am shocked to say the least ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1
"I can't react on messages neither i can reply while selecting a particular text, its annoying.",1
"White screen every time I open the app, unable to log in for over a week, have tried many many things Edit: hasn't worked for almost 20 days. Literally can't open the app.",1
"The app keeps crashing when I try to use some features. Also, it makes my post or reels vanish from my account at times. It hurts the reach. Fix the bugs.",1
"Many features are not available even in the beta program, feed is constantly outdated and comments on political discussions tend to disappear without a clear reason or report from other users. Furthermore, there is a ridiculous amount of false accounts and bots everywhere. I'm sorry but, just shame. Nothing more to say.",1
"UPDATE TO MY REVIEW: This app is no longer as satisfying as it used to be. Now it has so many bugs affecting it. For example, I cannot upload videos to my feeds or Reels anymore. Have reported the problem severally to Help centre but nothing has been done till now. *They seem not bothered*. Nowadays, snap chat, tik tok etc seem better because they do not have such problems. Now down to *. Instagram is no longer the app of yesteryears. It's become awful and the creators are not bothered.",1
Idk what the hell y'all are doing but I have been signed out twice the first time I had to make a completely new profile and NOW y'all signed me out and said I have to put in my number so y'all can send me a damn code BUT YALL DONT SEND A DAMN CODE!!!! Ive been waiting for a code for since 10 am it's now 11:43 pm simply trash,1
Stop trying to be everything. Why is my explorer full of tweets and tick tocks? And why is my feed full of accounts i didn't follow but Instagram for some reason thinks I will like them (never did)? Please bring instagram back. Or seriously change the apps name because its something else instagram lost its identity. . I have to add that I don't want people from Facebook to be able to send me a direct message especially that I can't report them.,1
Afer updating the instagram it's having a lots of issues like i can't even open my own exist account üò© sucks I'm literally so disappointed after updating this app üò° please fix it..,1
"This is worst app whenever i create any account then it say -you have to choose different username , this one is already taken . Please improve this as soon as possible . It's annoying .",1
Worst app ever. Without any reason instagram has banned my account. I have many important chats and other some things on it. Without any arguments it is really worst app off all time.,1
I don't get why I can't pick more than one photo like we use to it's really annoying because not only can I not pick more then one photo but now when I go to post any photos & videos I have to go & try & find my photos & videos rather than finding them right there it's really annoying & frustrating please fix this asap,1
"If I could rate this app into the negative category, I'd do so in an instant. Whoever is in charge in fixing this app should get fired because I can't even open the app anymore. As soon as I do, it crashes. Its just useless junk on my phone at this point.",1
If you want your account hacked and asked to asked to pay $200 to get your account back Download this app! Every support avenue I have tried to get account back has not worked and is NON EXISTENT.,1
Seriously......?????? Now an another unexpected glitch am trying to open my Instagram but its not working whenever i try to tap on the app and open it opens but get back to the home screen of my phone i am so frustrated of all these .......... Kindly see this as all my friends are in touch over there only i have no contact of any,1
"I don't like this app, no swipe reply message in my account, so I don't like it. Please need the swipe reply message.",1
Bad application.. Iam telling this because instagram has so many bugs if we report that problem 100 times also instagram will not solve the problem to our account... Instagram team please make sure that your team has been solving bug issues in the users accounts,1
Terrible. It keeps showing me the same posts. I've done everything I can to correct it. Nobody has helped me after sending reports,1
"Good lord I hate reels. They're hard to mute, they autopay and ruin the flow of just looking at pics of people I know. I hate suggested posts. 100% of the time it's things I don't care about at all. I wish I could turn this ""feature"" off permanently.",1
Rubbish platform ever. Which always suspend accounts without any reason and have always glitch. Just rubbish platform ever.üò†,1
"The app is freezing a lot, message notifications aren't instant you need to refresh the page everytime to see new ones. Don't get me started in reels- it hangs while adding or removing videos, audio or editing in general. 5 min job takes hours which shouldn't take that long. Impossible to change cover photo of highlights. The videos get inverted by itself while posting or the quality becomes degraded. Honestly the latest version has messed up the most important features.",1
I am using another app and Instagram app add in appearing again and again It is so irritating. Don't show such adds please.,1
"Instagram is only showing me black screen. When I tried to clear data, it's still showing me black screen. I tried to uninstall then re-install it, still black screen. I tried to turn off my phone then switch again, but still black screen. It's been 7 days and still black screen and it's so annoying. Please fix this app.",1
"It was good until all the new updates, logged me out earlier and wont let me log back in, its saying that my account has been compromised and I need to change my password however it won't let me change it! Very annoyed!!! I liked this app and my account with friends and photos!",1
No ratings at this moment. Can't open my account. I tried to install/Uninstall the app. Still not working.. please fix this..,1
"Constant glitches and now completely dead. Instagram has done everything to force you to use the mobile app, but their app is dogshit. I'm now in a position where I manage multiple accounts and can't even get to the login screen",1
"This sucks now it's way too many ads, I barely see posts from friends it's all curated with algorithms I never asked for and there's no setting to turn it off. Hate Instagram only use it for promoting shows and even then it's a scam if you don't pay to promote your post doesn't really make a dent.",1
"Whenever I send follow request to girls, they never accept my follow requests. I guess there are some technical glitches in this app.",1
It's not working in chat my search feed change no reload of message happening. After I restart my phone. Get me a solution fast,1
Very bad app don't recommend it it shadow band people for nothing So in my opinion just use Facebook or tik tok You will have a much better experience on those apps,1
"Hello, sir / ma'am I beg to inform you that when I open the chat here is no option reply swipe option available then I request to you please fix this bug...( this problem is only my id pls fix it up)",1
"If you want to see nothing that your friends post, a ridiculous amount of ads and content you've already seen on tiktok disguised as reels and forced down your throat, then you'll enjoy Instagram. But it's no longer a photo sharing app.",1
"When I open the app it goes to a blank white screen and it is very annoying as it is one of my main ways of contacting my friends, if it cant be fixed soon then I will stop using the app all together which I dont want to have to do.",1
When I start using this app is hanged always and when I start making reels reels gets struck in the middle and many times when I start watching reels ..reels get double voice I am very frustrated please fix this problem as soon as possible,1
I wat to change to the messenger setup because i cannot able to reply or react to msg i update and reinstall the app many time but it did not work.,1
"Frustrated when you need help from Instagram as there help centre can be very unhelpful Update- it's just getting worse & worse. ALWAYS existing problems teamed up with new ones almost weekly. I am in many ways gutted I'm so invested in this app as I've spent so much time sharing my joy at being a Frenchie Dad, but honestly it's beyond frustrating now & ""Meta"", ""Insta"", ""Facebook"", what ever you want to call yourself... it's very clear you couldn't give a rats backside for your cust. base",1
I have uninstalled and reinstalled and restarted my phone more times than I can count. all it keeps showing is a blank screen with nothing showing up. please fix asap.,1
What a rubbish app this is! Why I can't delete my instagram account? It's really very annoying when I write the current password but at the last stage it says that I put the wrong one. It's very funny that a very famous app makes this kinds off nonsense stuffs. Really suffering for this a lot.,1
The app has been crashing for about days now. I'm not understanding what the problem is I have done everything there is to do to try to resolve the issue. I have cleared the cache I have uninstalled I have reinstalled I have four stopped I have reset my phone 3 to 4 times. Something needs to be done.,1
"Awful, last account got hacked, literally no way to get it back, despite there being pictures of my child on there. Can't even report it to close it because nothing happens with that! Get round to making a new one, works fine for a bit but updates and won't even open now.",1
I had two accounts and I deleted my Instagram app yesterday. Now I can't log in to my accounts. It shows that username doesn't belong to anyone. What is this ?,1
"I think Meta has intentionally made Instagram unusable to force folks to post via Facebook. It is impossible to post more than one photo at a time, the posts from people I actually want to see are buried under all of these random suggested things, all of that when it isn't crashing. Truly the worst user experience. 5 stars to 0. Big fish eating the little fish has made things worse again for every day people again.",1
I followed less than 40 people and it disabled my account. Obviously I'm not a robot. Just a new poet trying to get in touch with other poets on instagram. They're acting like police and it's ruining the experience for normal people trying to enjoy a social media app and what it has to offer.,1
"For the past 3 weeks, all I get when opening the app is a black screen. Nothing I do fixes it, and did not get a response from Instagram as well.",1
ii have problem with this bug ....i dont really know whenever im trying to follow my friend then a notification occurs that there is certain activity harming our community i dont know why please fix this‚ù§‚ù§,1
"If you have children, do not let them download this app. It is full of naked women who show everything explicitly! I've reported so many inappriorate accounts that i dont follow but they still pop up on my instagram feed - Ever single report got declined and i was told to put my ""sensitivity"" mode on if i didnt want to see it. Yet its not supposed to be on here. It is not the way it used to be and im so very dissapointed! We wonder why we cant have faithful relationships with our partners.",1
"Videos are stopping if you scroll down sound still on. It has been more thann3 years. Nobody reported this? Can you fix it? I own Samsung S21 ultra, same happens to my iPhone 13 and 14 Pro max iPhone SE my android note 20 android A 52s 5G.... The app is meant to play videos and show photos. Fix it please. Both OSs.

Please resolve this issue immediately.,1
"All day i havent been able to open the app for more than five seconds at a time. I open it, it loads, and then it crashes before i get more than a glimpse of anything in it.",1
It's stopped working so I Uninstalled it to see if that would help. After installing it again I went to login and once I put in my password it would just load for ages. It's so broken and for a company this big im disappointed that they can't even make their apps work.,1

Almost 1000 time i reported that my Instagram ac replay option is not showing. But instagram not responded my problem. Bad experience,1

Worst app right now since morning my feed is not getting updated only some odd pages post and all old posts are getting shown Worst experience since morning and full of bugs,1
"I sent a unsuported file format and everytime i go to message the person my app crashes, please fix.",1
I always love te first post I see when I open Instagram. And then Instagram immediately takes it away and makes me dig around to find the post again.,1
What's with the reels? Not every app needs to be a tiktok. Also the fact that 80% of my newsfeed is less of what I choose to follow and more of follow suggestions and ads is so annoying.,1
I literally uninstalled this app 100 times and no matter what it will never load :/ all of my other apps work fine. Maybe fix it?,1
I had been freeze insta in freezer but it uninstall after every hour plz recover it as soon as u can and there is no voice call option literally üòë,1
"So many bugs in this app I am unable to react on any chat or meme and even unable to reply to any particular massage,storys stucks in between and even i don't get the option to change my chat theme, I am really disappointed by this. So,please take a look at it and solve as soon as possible. Thank you",1
"Used to be one of my favorite apps, now I get maybe one picture from the pages I follow before my ENTIRE homepage is nothing but suggested posts.. if I wanted to see what they were posting I'd be following them. Bring back chronological scrolling as an option at the very least.",1
One of the most useless apps and inconsistent in their policies. Glad to see these tech companies losing money. No competition so they have a monopoly in influencing prople. They allow people to advertise guns and promote violence and people selling them. They allow people to post pictures of drugs and their cannabis plants that is illegal in some countries but don't post nudity or you will be banned. Seems nudity is there big hang up and anything else goes.,1
"Fxxk Instagram, cannot copy and paste comments. When we not finished typing or typed something wrong, but we accidentally press ""post"" button, normally what can we do? Of course copy and paste the old comment and continue typing/make correction on the wrong words or sentence, and delete the old comment and post the new one. But since Instagram do not allow copy and paste comments, if we write something wrong, we can only REWRITE THE WHOLE LENGTHY PARAGRAPH!! This is so fxxking annoying üôÑüôÑ",1
Not getting many features which my frnds are getting .I am tired giving feedback on the app . No good support from the app ...,1
"This is now a very boring app, being full of adverts, suggested posts and (worst of all) reels. I used to like Instagram for all the beautiful and inspiring photos, but now it is full of reels. The reasons I don't like reels? 1. Opening image boring not beautiful or inspiring. 2. A reel takes too long to watch. In the time taken to view a reel from a single account I can scroll, view, enjoy and add a like to at least 8 or 10 beautiful photos from different accounts.",1
My Instagram account is getting new followers daily but are not showing on my profile. The count appears to be stuck at a number. Why is that? This has been happening for over a month now where I recieve followers daily but the numbers either stays at 3770 or declines rapidly not showing accurate growth. Please assist Regards,1
"Whenever I try to post a reel with mysic, when I try to search for a specific song the app crashes. For my personal experience it ruins Instagram for me, the app is practicaly not usable.",1
This app is singlehandedly ruining the lives of thousands of people. The MOST fruatrating technology I have ever used... I truly hate that we all got addicted to IG. Instagram literally has one job and it's to post and share content. It can't even do that right. The attacks on women. The racist algorithm.. We all collectively need to move to another platform. Follow for more helpful commentary!,1
"The interface is clunky af, reels repeating 3 times each time you watch them and also while reading comments is annoying. People uploading content doesn't help too much either, just repeating parrots.",1
"This app getting worst day by day, more bugs unable to see or refresh chats, unable to refresh home page and no response from the Instagram help center.",1
8/9/22 The changes made to my home page showing all these reels just sucks! Put it back the way it was. If I want a constant stream of videos I go some where else,1
Fix your story sharing feature it takes 2-3hr for posting a story and the thing is am on wifi with high-speed net and i watch more then 5videos on YT and came back so I notice No story replies:) pls fix it,1
"Account got hacked. After sending in all of my personal info, they never did anything to pause the account from being used or to get me back into my account. I waited for a week for them to do something about the account but again nothing was ever done. Very disappointed.",1
"App is not working properly seens last update, multiple issues , nothing is working seamlessly",1
"So I use this app to get my music out to the ones that follow me. I've been wanting to upload videos but when I open the app it stays open for 5 seconds and then it will close it's been doing that all day today, I'm about to just let it go. Y'all need to fix that problem",1
New update is really useless and bakvas .. I would like to suggest to the Instagram to not add that type of feature which make new troble for users. This is the worst app I ever use in my life ...now and then have to face different problems...the third class ever .. actually I want to give rate in minus but it's not possible otherwise I'll -100 to this app.,1
New updates in Instagram ( i.e. can't download any reel and not showing my interest based reels ) are useless and extremely dissatisfying . In recent times also insta doesn't have history option but i managed with it but this time good bye instagram .,1
I unable to tag a msg or reel and something else i want to be not countinued by this you have to pix the problem by making this glitch you have change the problem I may request you that i want able to tag the msg and reel it's making problem between my friends conversation,1
"Not working with latest update. I'm only rating it to get them to address this problem. My phone (pixel 4a 5g) tries to launch it then it crashes and randomly I'll get notices that Instagram ""keeps stopping"" please fix this",1
"Trying to be tiktok too much with the reels, be a photo app first. Final posts look different from the preview and just let people control whether they want a chronological timeline or not.",1
Good app but since some days I am not able to use instagram as whenever I am opening this app Instagram icon is visible then the screen becomes white and no further changes. I had reinstalled the app more than 3 times but the issue is still here. I request u to solve the issue as soon as possible.,1
I would have given you 0 stars if i could. Fix your algorithm I'm being spammed by sex workers acounts with sketchy Links that Instagram don't see a problem in when I report it. I'm starting to hate this app and it's stupid algorithm. Just make the mobile version like the desktop version and stop this shitfest!,1
"IG needs some work done. The following list doesnt display proper number until after a few days, The latest list doesnt load so you cant see anything thats new and so much more. Other then these issues, Not much to complain about other then the abundance of fake/scam accounts. Every single day I'm reporting scam accounts and IG's PR team does nothing. Its a joke. Wish Elon would buy IG/Facebook next. Maybe then things would be working right",1
This app is so irritating. From last few months I'm trying to update it but it never works. Seems useless nd waste of net nd time too. I reported this problem many time but didn't get any kind of correction nd positive response. I will recommend to don't install this app.,1
So many irritating bugs n glitches üò†...also I've lost my followers...üò†üò†..please solve these irritating bugs as soon as possible and i want my all followers back.üò†,1
I don't know I haven't able to reply to the specified message and can't able to set custom theme new update is just a waste and irritating...I hate tha most please clear that issues ... I have post this feedback a months ago but it's not get clear after many updatesüòí I have updating this whenever it shows to update but nothing has changed it's still tha how it was.... why are you not looking over itüò°üò°üò°,1
"Used to be a great app. Now it's lost its mind, seems to belch relentless adverts in your face whilst trying to be tiktok. I'd happily pay an annual subscription for an ad free version where I can share photos only with friends and see my friends posts chronologically. That's what it used to do so elegantly, before it fell into the gaping chasm of being rubbish. I'm still on it though! Waiting for an alternative we can all migrate to.",1
My Instagram isn't opening. It says again and again that there are some unfixed bugs. I have uninstalled the app twice but this issue is not resolving. It also gets hang in between.,1
"Still on blank screen upon opening app. After few months updating to latest version, seems like it's a feature now. Do I need to use iphone then? Which I don't want to, as most other users who prefer Android above ios. So please fix this. This is getting far beyond ridiculous for Instagram reputation.",1
"Updated Review: - 8 This company has billions of dollars. And yet they cannot make a bug-free app. This app is filled with so many bugs and inconsistencies and problems, that it's actually remarkable that so much money can be spent and have a product that is so poor. Not to mention, the parent company makes it so you don't reach your followers. You have to pay to reach the people who've decided to follow you. This whole system is upside down. Leave meta for discord",1
"Instagram used to be amazing. Now that FB has control of it, it's all suggested posts, ads and censorship. If I wanted FB that's where I'd be. Hoping someone comes out with a new platform. If you're not already hooked on Instagram (pre-fb infection) I'd steer clear and wait for something better.",1
"Cannot login using my phone number, email address and username. Instagram cannot detect my account when my friends find my profile just fine üòë",1
"The ads have become unbearably annoying, sometimes I get five or six ads in a row!!!",1
Worst thing about Instagram is that I don't have messanger feature on Instagram and I reported multiple times but Instagram team is not solving this bug.,1
"There is so many glitchs like same post recomandation every time i open, late messages send & recive, even my messege is not showing to me after I reopen instagram.",1
"Three times i had to change my password because they ""detected strange behavior"". I was just using another browser to log in. Even after confirming that it was me with an emailed security code, they said i confirmed it was NOT me and forced me to change my password. Three times. Bad communication, bad engineering.",1
After un installing the app and again I re installed more time the login page doesn't show upüò°it just a white screen on opening Instagram. But insta lite is working fine .i trying many wasy but no use i facing this problem from 1 month whatever the issue please find and let me know.,1
"What is happening to instagram? I updated to the latest version and still can't use it. The same issue persists: the instagram screen is still blank. Please fix this, I have tried reinstalling countless times it doesn't work",1
"Okay I originally gave 2 starts, I'm taking it down to one because this app will not stop glitching on me and I have to spend 30 whole minutes to post a set of pictures. Horrible app development. Don't y'all have like billions of dollars ??? I don't understand the incompetence. From Bad to Horrible.",1
Keep having network issues and the new updates are bad. Lost the option to reply to a message in particular,1
"Worst experience. I have been having this black screen issue whenever I try to open the app. Tried reinstalling ,switching off the phone. Did not solve the issue.",1
Followers are fluctuating and messages and mentions are not posting properly . Recent update is full of bugs ..,1
"I see I am not the only one having issues with uploading pictures to my feed either due to limited gallery options, or inability to upload more than one picture at a time. Highly frustrating üòë",1
I can't find a person's reel section like wth is happening and I can't even able to react to any message is this your service to the people? Worst update.,1
"This is the most broken app from the huge companies that I ever seen. Most of the futures are completely broken. Upside down reels, constantly changing UI layouts etc. God, such a garbage",1
When I try to sign in it says to wait a few minutes before u sign up. I restarted my phone still I got the same response. Worst app ever,1
After updating the app is not working at first I can't login into another account. After I logout the remaining account the app is showing a blank screen there is no option to login or anything.I restored my phone also Uninstaller the app and re installed nothing helping its just showing a blank screen after the Instagram logo,1
"White screen is coming from past 2weeks. Cleared the cache and tried with Uninstallation lo app. But unable to login into my account, only white screen is visible. Try to solve this bug as fast as possible.",1
Unreliable rubbish. After every update it becomes unstable and then crashes constantly for several days until they fix it. Clearly no bug testing goes on.,1
I'm being unable to share anything on Instagram from the last few days. Fix it ASAP. It's being so annoying.,1
"this trash Instagram keeps crashing. i even undated it and did whatever i could have done. still its keep crashing. meta(Facebook) has destroyed Instagram app like no other. before it came under the meta. this app was fine and fun to use. trash Facebook. i wish the person who sold this app, make another alternate app. i don't like this stupid app anymore.",1
"Just went to make a post and had to jump through hoops just to get to my camera roll pictures. I thought I just needed to update the app. No I guess yall want it that way. I'm good, bye. Also I now can't post multiple pictures from my cameras photos. Yall are Literally killing this app",1
My personal experiance is that majority of ads on this app is fraud. Never purchase anything. Once again I warn all those people who are using this app that this app promotes fake and cheat companies.,1
"Algorithm is a joke, can't grow my page at all without paying and rarely see any posts from people I follow, it just shows reels instead",1
This app cannot show me message button on other profils even other to mine message option I really love this app but this is only doing to me even I already 100 times submit a report to Help centre but nothing change please read my review and help me instagram,1
"I like this app.BUT there is stupid freaking scrap in service, I have reported a problem about features in chat last month.but still there are not fix my problem. To Instagram app, first verify that everyuser able to access all features of Instagram then you will expand or update what you want. I Hope this can reach you.",1
I don't know what intoxication is sitting on by the service center of Instagram. don't know how much time i reports issues but still they did not solved yet. üò°üò°üò°,1
I can't find reel option in Instagram. Reel option should be given in my Instagram. Also Instagram is not reccomming my reels to my followers. please solve problem instgram team User id - amit_solra,1
"Had 2 leave the beta test to have my account work which is lame. I could never post video stories if it went over 15 seca, do the ""add yours"" story posts, + couldn't send multiple videos to people in mgs. Better since leaving beta, but always another issue. Don't understand why IG rolls out new features when not done testing them for kinks.. Since the 60 second story update, I haven't been able to use captions after 1 video. It thinks it's the last story and deletes my current one entirely.",1
My Instagram reels used to have good reach of thousands of views. Now they have no reach. My Instagram content is original and still so pathetic performance. This was not the case a couple of weeks back. Please fix it.,1
Worst experience ever!!!! Could not able to upload story in my Instagram account. This issue is from passed 2 months.Had tried to share my issue with Instagram but it doesn't help me not at all bother about the issue.. unsatisfied with Instagram,1
Dear Instagram.. I'm having a huge problem on instagram of eachof my reels vedios veiws are getting freez it's a problem with the reels algorithm fix it! @instagram team Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
The app is very good but i am disappointed about that private accounts Option I am not able to see girls pic in that private account remove that option,1
"This is one of the worse apps when dealing with security. My account has been hacked over a month now. I've done everything that was required on my part, over and over again. Still haven't gotten anything. I'm now at the point where I just want the account deleted but they won't even do that. What's annoying as well is that there's no one to reach out to. Also, why do I even need to go through the two step process to get my account back when they already have my original email? Very frustrating.",1
Every time uodating and adding new features makes it worse and worse! Just leave it alone KID! Leave it alone.,1
Man this app sucks..there is this option called more options when u long press a person's chat..wanna block that person.. that doesn't work at all ..,1

"Poor experience I recorded a live video and while I was adding captions, suddenly it disappeared. I cannot find it anyway. I will need to record it over again.",1
"Crashes when I want to post a picture, I have space and the app is updated, so why Can't I post anything!!",1
"I uninstalled and reinstalled and since then my app refuses to open. I've tried rebooting, reinstalling, clearing cache. Nothing works. It just goes to a black screen",1
Bug Report Not able to access the Profile page and ad tool.. now search tool is also not working.. however everything is fine with Instagram lite and web interface ( through laptop) please help Best Regards,1
It is very easy for people to hack your account and most times you can't get it back and Instagram doesn't really help you to get it back,1
Please solve notification problem in this app. I receive notifications too late of messages. 6 to 7 months before i had same problem,1
"Unfixed bugs. Always problems with uploading videos. The chat has been bugged as long as I can remember. Interface lags. For nothing, but photo uploads and mindless scrolling it's good.",1
"Too buggy after the update, it takes so much time to load, also upon pressing down the tile, image loads after a blink of a black screen. Needs to be rectified soon.",1
"Almost any song/audio I get to search on, to use for my reels are unavailable. And they're forcing me to want to use songs/audios I don't want. It's been happening for a long time now. Please what is the problem?",1
"I uninstalled the gram couple days back. Tried installing it again, the app doesn't open at all. Just shows a black screen. Annoying to say the least.",1
My Instagram doesn't working properly..i can't like anyone's post or any reel when i like any post or reel it's show a notice try again later. What is this... please fix this problem as soon as possible,1
"Aaaand here we go again page refreshes anytime anything interesting is on my feed, nice just what I came here for smh. Dms lag sometimes hours behind notifications.",1
"No reply button, no react emoji button, reels freeze within a sec of playing, story upload problem with some reels. Totally trash, despite of 100s of reports they haven't fixed it.",1
"do something w the login thing. this app was 5 star for me until i tried to loginmy another acc and it showed NOTHING. I uninstalled the app and again installed it thinking it would make any difference but it just got worse. Now i cant login ANY account because everytime i open this app, the only thing i can see is the whole screen is black and there's NOT EVEN ONE OPTION TO LOGIN/SIGNIN ON THE ACCOUNT. FIX THIS BUG! (oh and apparently im not the only one who thought their phone isnt working)",1
I have got very poor experience about it Whenever I posted any video it converts my video upside down.And i don't know why Instagram has problem or what my reels never getting audience Instagram is not recommending my reels videos to mere people.i am uploading my reels daily.my algorithms is also good.but nothing is working to increase views of my reels I'm totally upset and depressed.Allof my work and efforts are going into waste,1
I can't upload my stories in this app worst restrictions and message notification not delivered to me in the video call automatically screen off am totally hate this app,1
"Idk why, it seems happened since the last update. I can't repost the stories even others always mentioning me in their posts. I am android user. Please resolve this issue.",1
"I already hated this app after they turned every post into an ad or ""recommended"" I don't want to watch the garbage you recommend. I want to watch the garbage I like. Now I can't even get on the app without it force closing itself. Glad I was here to witness the demise of Zuckerberg. Next stop, rumble!",1
Whenever I do audio or videos call with earphone it doesn't connect..... But I call hear the audio of the videos or reels which I play in this app...,1
now replies are not being displayed anymore and it takes a lot of time to send reels to story. I regret to have updated my Instagram,1
Worse service. Someone hacked my id i have sent plenty of mail but it seems they doesn't care. No response. This is how you treat. Its a critical case you guys should be active. But no response at all.,1
I have problems with dragging specific message reply option and also in replying specific message using emojis also but insta doesn't give me propper soln I have reported that many times,1
Lots and Lots of Bugs.. Sometimes screen turn white except of picture rest all white on Black Theme. Sometimes posts can't be shared as stories. After so many advertisement revenue still no improvements at all.,1
Lots of long videos that you can't control ( rewind by 5 or 10 sec ... for example ) it's either you watch till the end or start the video from the beginning! That's stupid! And now the stories are getting longer and have the same problem! Instagram lost its identity.,1
Why are they literally trying to copy TikTok? First came the reels and now they have full screen posts without a seamless transition between them. It's honestly quite pitiful how they're straight up copying TikTok. Update: thanks for rolling back the TikTok changes! Kind of sucks that we the masses need Kylie Jenner to advocate for us but glad it happened!,1
I updated it but there's still no changes. Everytime I tried to see who viewed my story the app keeps closing,1
"The notes update is super unnecessary, the worst update. At least add an option to deactivate that.",1
I can't reply on messages and I have only like option on every message if I want to send any other reaction on message so I can't do that. Why? It's been 1 year and no one replied on my comment.,1
"Instagram makes some of the silliest changes that affects your post, for instance, you make a post or a reel and it only allows a certain amount of people on your friends list to view it.",1
Chat themes option is not available 2 when I want to react with different emoji on message so don't able to do that and the only reaction available is like ‚ù§Ô∏è please fix it,1
This is the worst app bcoz we can't easily delete or deactivate account if there is a way then it is make to be so much complicated.why we can't have 100% access on our account.,1
It is the worst application ever. It constantly hacks my personal accounts for no reason and every day I create a new account. I am really bored. I hope that it does not hack my current account or log out of it or ban me. I hope you solve the problem that it becomes a bad application,1
"This app just crashed my account just atomaticaly deleted, all my post, stories are gone. What the hell happen, it said i have not been keeping up with their guidelines which i was and did nothing wrong. What the hell man. Fqk",1
From 2 days I am unable to receive messages from new followers. I have tried so hard to resolve it but no replies from Instagram report.,1
"For some reason all of my posts appear blurred and fuzzy. This happens whilst editing them and changing the cover photos as well. I have tried clearing the cache, uninstalling and reinstalling the app as well as rebooting my phone and the issue still persists. It's not a hardware issue. It's simply unacceptable!",1
"My account kept signing out , suddenly and telling me that the owner had changed the password, please look into this i've changed my password many times now and it kept happening",1
I'm not able to login. Like I logged out of my account now can't even see the login page anymore. Tried clearing all data even tried uninstalling and installing again but still not able to view the login page. Please resolve the issue.,1
"Instagram was better before, but recently from past 2-3 days it's message feature is not working for my one particular account. All my new chats that i send or receive are dissapearing and it's like going back to chats shown 2 days back. It happened before but got resolved the very next day but this time it's not working. Its creating a lot of problem as that particular account is my main account. Wheareas for the other accounts it's working fine. Pls help me",1
"My Instagram application is not working No reels are refresh, no messages refresh and no stories I can watch nothing is work I try everything but didn't work",1
Not at all user friendly and smooth while uploading photos.. App crashes continuously even in my s22,1
"It's getting worse and worse, crashing sometime for no reason, failing to send messages. It was much better and seamless experience years bach. Since meta touched, they made it only worse.",1
Dear Instagram team I didn't do anything against your policy please review my Instagram Account right now. I can't able to send messages for 2 days I always follow all rules of Instagram. Please get back this restriction from my account. Thank you. Details are below : User name - shiv_premi_47,1
I was randomly suspended from my private Instagram app? I have not broken against any guidelines and yet I've been suspended for no reason. I have seen other people also have this problem happen to them. Instagram please fix this as soon as possible!!,1
I was having issues related to log in since it was showing all white screen.it got sort out after 3-4month but again When i opened my insta it showed a white and then a create an account screen! Now again I'm getting that log in problem.. like why insta is getting that much horrible to use..it's getting annoying day by day,1
APp doesn't allow to write captions and include hashtags. I can't see the reply feature also. Totally sucks!!,1
None of my posts show up in hashtags. I just post my movie collection and reviews. This is a terrible app with no help when you ask Instagram to look into it.,1
I'm having problem with this app from last 6-7 days while using the app suddenly it stopped and then when I entered my cell phone number it shows that it is invalid and also the OTP is not coming. After that I uninstalled it and then again installed but then also the same problem. So what should I do ?,1
Instagram is not working properly since past week......it is happening frequently I need help can Instagram consider my problem??,1
the app glitches way too much and the notes feature keeps dissapearing on one of my accounts. it's annoying.,1
"Unfortunately it's for more than five days now that Instagram won't work at all, there is just a white screen and nothing else, I have uninstalled and installed it for several times but nothing changed. All my job is gone, all my students and followers are waiting for my posts and stories but I have no access to Instagram at all.",1
"Instagram has done one of the biggest mistake by selling themselves to facebook üí©, they made sure to fill it with bugs so it becomes unable to use. I am totally disappointed with this bug I can't even call it an app. ü§¶üèª",1
"This is most likely the worst of the well known apps out there. The updates are TERRIBLE. By every update Instagram just gets worse and worse. For Android the reply option doesn't exist. And posting art is a disaster. The cropping, quality everything is terrible. And I hate that they call themselves ""meta"". They couldn't be further from anything meta related. Just try to grow on tik tok instead. And trust me when I say that I hate tik tok. Anyways, it's just a bad app. I don't care for it",1
Bug reports aren't answered!! Chats doesn't work posts disappears often show can't load reports aren't answered,1
Doesn't refresh half the time. Even when reinstalled. No notification about downtime either.,1
Completely gone down hill. App crashes as soon as I load it. I need to clear it's cache each time to have a chance of it loading for more than a few seconds.,1
It wouldn't even let me past the login screen. Tried resetting my password but it just kept sending me through to some random help page about recovering my email???,1
Not able to get the messager updates and my DMS are showing new messages even though I already went into them they are still marked as unseen.,1
I have been trying for a year to submit report that i cant update my massaging But it's not working i have tried updating delete and installing everything but it won't update,1
App is screwed up where you can't select multiple photos. Selecting photos in general just changed and it's defaulting not to my phone's gallery but to some setting where photos are online or something.,1
I have checked all the settings... This has happened so many times that ppl can repost my story and i cannot repost theirs ...I'm sick of it,1
Reels doesn't work. U just can't add some music or effects. Stories as well. When the real is ready to upload the app just shutting down and delete ur draft.,1
"Sorting not working in showing followers/following list and also my account not showing ""more"" option in sensitive control.",1
It was been glitching badly lately and now my feed and page won't load at all. Its just a white screen.,1
I gave it 2 before now updating it is as a 1 star. I hope I would have option to give 0 star. The expereing of using Instagram now a days becoming horrible. 1. Too much lags 2. bugs 3. Hang for long time 4. 15 sec reels take more than 15 to 46 minutes some time even in high speed Internet area 5. Multiple accounts management needs to improve.,1
"I have complained many times but my messaging options are not updated reaction, reply and long story options are not available for me so I request Instagram community to give the update for meüôè",1
"The new algorithm is wack, I can't see cute pictures of my friends anymore, its just Videos, ads and recommendations from people I don't follow! Instagram lost its Originality. Please bring back the old Instagram!",1
I faced endless problems all the time. üòÆ‚Äçüí®üôÑ From crashes to bugs to unable to upload a post or boost it. Never encountered a more unreliable app as this. Not worth the time.,1
"The app really just broke on me tdy, it forced me out of my accounts nd just wouldn't respond even when I Uninstalled it, I've refreshed my phone and opened it, but all of the features are gone, it's like having an old version of Instagram nd I can't update it, I like this app but this situation is awful I felt like I could have lost my acc due to this error",1
"Reels are absolute garbage, and the workspace Instagram provides to make Reels crashes my entire phone every time I even so much as attempt to make a Reel. Algorithm and Shadowbanning problems are still a major problem, drafts of both Reels and Posts will get corrupted and become blank and unusable after a day, my feed is pushing only Reels, so I don't actually see posts I care about anymore, and I just hate using this platform now. It's not enjoyable, it's not going to get better. Skip it.",1
I have updated the recently. All of sudden i am unable to see the feed . It is not refreshing only reels are changing. No post getting changing. Last update was worst update. It is having lot of bugs. Please don't update u r app.,1
I can't login in my account 3td day. Always error and notification - to try after a few minutes. It lasts 3d day,1
"Basically half of what you see is ads, and the other half is ""suggested content"", which is just another type of ad, zuckerberg can go himself",1
"Hii , i have been using the Instagram for 2 year i didn't find any problem in this 2 year but now after updating the Instagram is not working properly if i click on my profile it doesn't open it will goo back to phone home screen again we need to open from Frist then also it won't open please make what problem is there in Instagram and before updating the save option was there means to save for our gallery after updating the save option as gone there is noo save option, please doo it correct",1
Most cunning and cheap company...I want to delete my ac...but at last it showing something went wrong please try again some time....badly instagram...backoff only amount to produce,1
Remove the notes its stupid also why are there ads in the explore now these apps are free because we pay for it with our time being wasted on it so let's be less annoyed at least,1
"Ads ads ads! The entire app is only designed for ads! You scroll down each time there's an ad! I'm sick and tired of seeing ads that are full of scams! Most people don't buy into it so why bother?! Instagram doesn't care as long as they're getting paid while people are being robbed off their privacy and personal details! Instagram doesn't let small businesses be known, it only lets CHOSEN businesses flourish! You only become known when Instagram wants, otherwise you remain invisible!",1
Getting real tired of seeing p0rn all over the place. I follow a meme page and it changes. You'd think with as controlling as FB is that this wouldn't be a thing since they own IG but whatever I guess.,1
I don't know what happened after updating this app recently or not but it's really terrible especially on stories archive. Some stories that I posted didn't save automatically in archive even I have already turn on that feature. Is there any technical issues? Please give me some solutions to fix it.,1
"Unable to see others feed nd stories along with my messages I've reported it several times no response, whenever I open Instagram it's just a blank screen that's it I've tried everything from reintalling the app to logging in again nothing worked .",1
"I recently got a new phone and when I tried to log in it doesn't recognize me and when I tried to click for got password it keep telling me ""error try again later."" I don't want to keep doing this every time I try to log in on to Instagram on my electronics. It getting very annoying. Please fix it üôè",1
"I cannot see reels button in my second account it is like the old Instagram, plus sometimes the text in follow button is totally black, and the follow button in reels are not properly aligned. The new notes is really boring and annoying",1
I can't login. I click to open the app and all that shows is a blank screen. I've tried to uninstall and reinstall but that doesn't work. Its very frustrating. Its been like this ever since the last update.,1
I hate Instagram but I keep it because of the maybe three things that I use. I keep in touch with some people I normally wouldn't there are some posts that I like but it's mostly stuffed with suggested post that I have absolutely zero interest in and I tried to say I'm not interested and they pop up anyway. God forbid you click on one post on a topic that you're not normally interested in and it's like the floodgates open every other post that you see is going to be of that topic.,1
When you turn the app on you're met with a solid black screen and you can't log in or do anything. Its been like this for over a month now and it hasn't been fixed. Facebook ruins everything they touch,1
"The hash tags were working for 2 or 3 months then they stopped working altogether, not cool. Each update makes it worse, videos freeze when fully uploaded, live chats are blurry, posts keep loading, story features don't work, some features work on some accounts but don't work on others, every update makes it worse. The developers got bricks for brains",1
"Instagram hasn't been working for a while, doesn't refresh feeds, can't open messages, can't access anything , even updated the app hoping it'll work, still the same.... please fix ASAP!",1
"This app has completely gone to the wrong place. Tons of scam, missleading, fake and cheat adds. Tons of adds that no matter how many times you report it, they still re-appear. So many adds and scam that it feels like it's a scam app overall. Maybe you want to stop taking money for scam adds and actually try to monitor and check it before posting? Useless app",1
Please fix the app I have been trying to reach out to support since so long. No response. Now i switched to lite and evrything is proper there,1
"My feed is now just full of suggested post and nothing else, once I like a post from my friends it disappears and replaced with a suggested post. Instagram used to be good but now it's just like the other social media apps, looking for a quick buck.",1
"Lately my instagram application got updated but faced a lot of problem while logging in, also I try seeking songs on search option (to upload on story) but not able to get through any of my fav music later need to settle with the given one..",1
Video or story download in gallery without music. I don't like that.. also music is not clear,1
The app doesn't work for me anymore. Every time I open the app my screen turns black and nothing loads. I've tried re-downloading it and it still won't work. It's been a month that this has been happening. I did everything I can but nothing works.,1
Not able to use Instagram on my Samsung S7 edge... it only displays blank screen whenever opened. I tried lot of stuffs install Uninstall restart everything but its not working.. even aero instagram is behaving the same way kindly look into this... Its an month so many users are facing this issue.. why isn't Instagram doing anything,1
"When I try to post pictures in the app now, it only gives me the option to post pictures that I have already added to my instagram. My ""gallery"" for adding photos, is just every photo I have ever added. Can't multiselect pics from my actual gallery anymore.",1
"Instagram is not working properly nowadays , I can't keep a reel or story for 60 seconds and I can't reply on a specific message, can't change the chat themes and I reported this problems more than 10 times but still Instagram is taking time to fix this bugsüôÇüôÇü•≤",1
"Huge number of bugs coming up recently. Suddenly closes, like funtion not working, link to reels doesn't work, it just takes me to some random reel and not to the one the link was shared for and many more.",1
"I can't singin this what is this. What is this issue , this is from past 10 days I can't open it just white while opening. It's the issue with many people's you should look on it and remove the bug. It's very difficult for me. I have to talk to friends. Please get it done .",1
Bait bubble notifications constantly trigger whereby afterwards there's nothing in the app that happened just to get you to open app lots of times a day,1
"Mad glitchy - photos & vids always have literal GLITCHES in them, buttons don't work right, zero customer support & user protection, & downright awful (if existent) algorithm. Feed's so full of ads & irrelevant junk I don't know what the point of following anyone even is at this point. Only positive thing is unlike Twitter I can keep it deactivated indefinitely without losing all my stuff because it'll drive you up the wall so much you'll definitely want to stay away for months on end. üôÇ",1
"The app is not working. It gets installed but when I try to open the app, a white screen appears. I have tried to uninstall and install the app multiple times but it still does not work.",1
It is always hanging when i try to upload pictures ....... I have to uninstall and login back before i can actually upload a picture,1
From July 17 my invite collaborater feature disappeared i have reported to instagram many times about the bug but no response as well as no change in my acc. Instagram is getting worse this days . I was not expecting this from instagram I'm using it from 2015 üò£ but this year I have faced lots of bugs in my account üòè,1
This update is the worst!!!! Kindly solve it. Really hard when it comes to reels in the feed. Very weird and getting reels from the same page even if skipping it,1
"it just gets worse and worse! something changed with the ad algorithm recently and now all I get are ads for terrible and often offensive 3d games that I have zero interest in, I just don't understand how Instagram keeps getting worse...",1
"New update: - 5 ads in a row and only one post from a friend. - chat now is a mess, messages doesn't load.",1
It's an addictive time waster influenced and censored by libs. I only wish to use it for a free cloud for my photos and vids.,1
Instagram is not working. I have to text someone urgent and I dont have there number and instagram is suddenly its not working. Im sorry I have to give this is very bad review bc this is unacceptable. You should have actless nofi us. But its not working. What ever is the problem should be fixed quickly.

"Impossible to get my hacked Instagram account back. I'm European, and got hacked by some Nigerian person. I sent video selfie to insta multiple times, but to no avail. This is very upsetting since I use insta for my buisness. Zero customer support.",1
Something happened after updating the app. Nothing is working. Msgs are not going. Feed not refreshing.,1
"I don't have many problems with the app besides the fact that when I gain followers it wouldn't increase on my profile even though it shows that I've gained new followers, it's happened before but i chose to blow it off until it started getting irritating. The problem still happens after you've complained, this is disappointing Instagram",1
My account got deactivated without any valid reason and I am unable to reach out to the Instagram support team. Neither have I heard from anyone from Instagram team for my plea against this unethical account deactivation. What behaviour is this??!!,1
"My account not working suddenly it was getting error and im unable to receive msg ,sent msg , unable to see reels etc... worest app and its facing bug",1
I am not able to access my account !!! It's just loading from a log time even after verification!!!!!!! Or asking me to log out!!!,1
Horrible. You get hacked NOBODY WILL HELP YOU EVER. I have reached out to instgram more times then I can count. Scammers left right and center. Pathetic. Used to be my all time favorite app. Spent 6yrs building a page that was truly authentic to have it stolen and dude tell me I have to pay 500$ to get it back!????????? Thank Instagram........,1
"The way the app has moving is terrible, it pushes content that you can't have any say in seeing, it's so annoying to see all these posts from other accounts I couldn't care less about on my feed and can't do anything about, and it's supposed to be about pictures, all I ever see anymore is vids, this is going downhill fast, you're not tik tok",1
"What's the point if you can't see the posts of people you follow??? The main feed page which should ONLY have content from the ppl you follow is now a deluge of ""suggestions"" and even if you click ""older posts"", you will NOT get to see ALL older posts in order. The app already had an explore tap, why would you do this??!?",1
My messenger is not working after all updates; I'm not able to react a message in chat : not able to reply a particular message in chat.,1

Edit: Prior to this review, I did uninstall and reinstall the app, restarted my phone couple of times, and switched from mobile data to WiFi. And still, extremely poor performance from the app.",1
"Cant get back into account, tried contacting support but all it does is redirect you to help centre which basically says ""if you cant get in then tough""",1
"I signed out accidentally and I am not able to login through Facebook because that's how I created my account. I am not able to reset password or sign up using my email id or phone number. I have been getting same error message as ""Please try again after few minutes"" for days now. Worst ever.",1
"Good, but I'd love it if Instagram returned to prioritizing photography. Update: Instagram is no longer my primary photo sharing/community building site. I primarly use Vero True Social for my photography sharing now. A much better community with way less spam and out of touch promotional clutter. Just photography sharing and community building.",1
"This is the worst app i have ever seen There are so many bugs in this, if we goto reels section the reels play half and automatically stops. I dont know why is it happening even my network is 75mbps. Instagram your the worst 0 star ratimg app for me. üò°",1

I can still access through the Web, but the app doesn't work",1
"It was a nice app, but woth every update, it got worse. Now it takes 4-5 tries for the app to even start, and every time after i open it, it starts the tutorial (as in ""how to watch stories"" or ""click here to like"")",1
"Using Samsung 22 to post, Instagram only accesses IG photos when multiple photos are selected. I can access my phone gallery to select 1 photo, but not multiple. It feels as if they were actively looking for ways to make the app worse.",1

If I try to reply then it show like 3 and 4 image And many other glitches due to this I have delete my I'd may time and I have reported problems and send feedback but their is no reply or solution,1
This app is annoying because in every 3 days they giv out some update and when we don't do update the Instagram not work properly they stopped in between the app,1
Absolutely horrible user interface. Nothing is intuitive about it. I don't have the ability to control my own feed. I get spammed with everything under the sun for suggested posts. I can't even find my own posts in my own feed. I don't know why I bother with maintaining an account.,1
There's some glitches with the messages and comments lately. Also keeps showing me I have unread messages when there's none.,1
"Love the app... When it's working they seem to keep updating stuff their end and it just breaks your account which sucks if it's this is your business or brand it's not quick problems either these issues can go on for weeks, I can't see half of my insights without it closing down, even follower count is frozen so who knows what's happening, also only a few percent of your followers actually get to see your posts so honestly having followers seems pointless now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1
I got a new phone and in the process thought I had backed everything up to the cloud and when I went to transfer everything over to my new phone my Instagram was locked out and nothing I do will let me get back into my other Instagram account so I had to start a new account.

"I can't sing up with my Facebook, every time it shows ""please wait few minutes before you try again"". I am very much tired üòî",1
Very bad. I had reported almost three times. But no answer or solution is provided. I can't reply to specific massage to my friends massage. Why. Please solve this issue.,1
I'm unable to use the messaging features on the app. I have updated version of app but the features are not updated. Featured like tag replying to a particular message and reacting to messages.,1

Can you please update your app and fix this problem?",1
My Instagram app not loading while connect with wifi. I have checked my wifi network no issue with that all other apps running smooth. I'm facing this problem for last one week. I have checked by reinstalling the app and updated.,1
"I can't log in to my account. When I message them, I couldn't go back to my home screen; it was stuck in the message section. I need to force shut down my phone to escape.",1
This app has only gone downhill since instagram was acquired by Facebook. Let me turn off the garbage algorithm's suggestions and see the content of the people I actually follow...,1
"Not expected, Getting trouble in sign in my own account. Everytime i am trying to login my account it just continuously showing error, ""sorry there was a problem with your request "", even i had changed my password 5-6 times in a row. Too much bad experience.",1
"Instagram used to be amazing! It's now trying to be tiktok, and it ain't tiktok! And more importantly, it doesn't want to be. Tiktok is tiktoxic!! Period!! Stick with what worked, what was good, what connected people through their love of common interest.",1
"I am sure that the app has some faults. My feed doesn't work and I can see no posts, the profile pics are just black circles and whenever you try sending messages they don't get sent! This is seriously annoying. I have tried everything from my side, from logging out, uninstalling, rebooting the phone and even update the phone . Nothing works out. Please try to fix this as soon as possible.",1
I am said to offense the community guidelines. Don't know the reason as well. We work hard for ever content we create.. This is not at all that we deserve.. We report and there is no response from the other end... My reach has been decreased... This hurts a lot... You should have a better customer support. .. This is not at all accepted from a big platform like Instagram.. Facing some kind of error... Where I'm unable to use reels and the option is not available for the same,1
A little bit confused because they lag if ever in my phone but I don't think it's my phone or a signal.,1
"I cant watch live from instagram because it keeps freezing, lagging. I already try many ways to watch live but same result.",1
I reported this issue many times with Instagram but they aren't responding. I don't have vanish mode feature. How to activate vanish mode feature and other features like tap and hold to react on messages while chatting.,1
"It's just not as good as it used to be. Always ads, shows me what I think I should see and gets it so very wrong anyway. Always running in the background looking at my phone. Privacy is non-existent even with every setting possible. Update, tried to login to close the account, says it doesn't recognise my password, can't send email as that is no longer in use. No other way to get access, maybe Instagram could try sending a code to the phone registered on that account but that would be too easy.",1
Need an option for what type contents to be shown as suggessions or turning off suggessions. Too much vulgar contents in search area and suggested reels sections. It is a distraction and difficult for normal users who are trying to self control.,1
"Had little issues with instagram until this past week. Whenever I open the app, the screen is black. I've done what I could to try and fix the problem on my end. Please have this bug fixed!",1
I'm not allowed to follow more than ten people at a time without being suspended for multiple days. Same goes for tagging people in my captions. It won't even let me post captions with just text. Can't comment either. I'd complain about the pushing of accounts you don't follow on the feed but thankfully someone showed me the option to see only who you follow is there,1
"My account got disabled and i don't know what happened. So I made a new account just now and after signing in, it got suspended again. I just signed in, like what the hell is happening?",1
I'm suddenly unable to accept collaboration invites. We have major campaigns in the works that rely on this feature. I've submitted multiple support requests and my app/phone are up to date. PLEASE HELP.,1
This app is constantly giving me a white screen as soon as i open it. I've tried almost every possible way but it only works through secure folder that too eith frequent crashes. please fix the issue ASAP.,1
"I don't understand how after every update, the app runs like garbage. Reels don't want to load, my messages don't load. Even after my phone does it's routine restart, the app still runs like trash.",1
We are unable to sign up and create a new account in instagram. I think this is a blocker issue which need a immediate fix,1
"I have some issues editing my videos on my story. It's crashing, what's happening.",1
The help centre is not useful. They don't solve the problem. How many times I report the problem in Instagram account. They could not response for it.I have another problem don't have the add music option to upload the photo.,1
"Very worst service don't use this stupid application My old account work good but my new account not work good,I can't reply separately..I see many disadvantages compared with my old accountüò° so I give only 1 star",1
Their is a lag issue while uploading photo very bad experience for me . I have experience this type of issue for the very first time . And after reporting also I am not getting any type of response.,1
"Direct messaging failing. Messages taking hours to come through, disappearing once sent, reappearing hours later. You have ruined your app Instagram. Direct messaging with friends was the one last good feature and now you've distroyed that too",1
"I wish I can give Zero Star üò° This APP is getting worse and worse. Whoever thought of the new functions is definitely NOT a regular IG users! Not only that, the new functions annoyed the shxt out of everyone. The APP itself is full of bugs and glitches! This is definitely a downgrade! ‚ö†Ô∏è Instagram! Please listen to your users and fix the problems before creating more useless & stupid new functions!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è",1
"I can't log in, it's annoying and saying that try to do it again in a few minutes lol. And I was going to create a new account because I thought that maybe my account has the problem but not.

"Very discriminating platform. Algorithms are completely in favor of big accounts. Notification about pages that mention or feature my account end up in a ""hidden"" message which I often miss to see, on the other hand I get bombarded by ads and unwanted content that I don't want to see. Instagram blocks people who legitimately post photos without tricks and on the other hand other users post spam and do monkey business. Somebody wake up the moderators. Now Please.",1

"Too many ads and no one cares about the shopping section. Apps are only out for money, and Instagram is no exception. Not to mention, many artists and content creators get shadow banned for no reason while Instagram does nothing to solve the problems of real abusers and bots. Reels are stolen videos or tiktoks. Good for messages and that's really it.",1
"Can the app please stop showing me useless reels from people I'm not remotely interested in? I scroll by one picture and get ""You're all caught up"" and then moved to reels. NO I AM NOT, I am only interested in catching up with the posts that people/pages I follow post, not 5 second reels. If I was so curious about random reels to waste my time I'd simply shift to tiktok. FFS stick to what you are known for!",1
"I can't open my deactivated account, can't even sign up for a new one. It's always crashing.",1

"I used to really enjoy Instagram because when I published I reliably got engagement and new followers, seemingly based on the quality of my content.

Can't use the Instagram. And i am having the black screen issue with all the versions of Instagram l. I did everything thing reinstalled it many times. And also tried clearing the chache. But nothing works and also tried to raise a complaint but yet no questions were answered.,1
"Manipulative tactics like updating the first pic you see when opening the app so that you scroll to find it, so to stay more time in the app is why I know this app soon will not have a future. An algorithm that penalizes small users doesn't help either. Not seeing the posts of my friends makes it worse.",1
"Worst experience... My Instagram app is not working for past one week, I have mailed Instagram help 100+ times so far, no response till the date. Whenever I try to open I can only see the blank screen.. I even tried reeinstalling the app.",1

"This used to be a good app when your photos were actually seen by your followers , now it's just an app full of useless adverts and suggested posts. My feed actually now has more posts from people that I don't follow than people that I actually follow . How about creating an algorithm that shows all your photos to all your followers rather than an extremely low percentage of your followers",1
After Updating App the duration of story again it has showing duration of 15 seconds plz make it upto 1min.. Plz allow to hide only one particular story from particular person not all the story make that option available,1

Instagram is too glitchy. Some features don't work at certain times which is frustrating and makes me really not want to use the app.,1
"I had an account logged into my devices which i checked almost everyday. One fine day the ai logs me out and tells me to go to help center and ""get help logging in"" and asks me to confirm who i am. It asks for only one question when i ask for support which is my second option. The question is if i have an image of myself on there and i don't. So now i just can't log in and i am not being responded to through email and i have no idea how to contact them",1
App is not working properly only glitches the chat box does not loads and messages are not send even when you're connected to wifi solve this problem Instagram,1

"Seriously, if I wasn't already fed up with this ridiculous app, I definitely am now. For a company this size, you sure do have useless algorithm. Doesn't matter how many times I click ""not interested"" on a post/reel, I still end up with 263 more just like it. You're not TikTok.",1
I am not getting new version of insta which has enabled to put notes of our own I tried many times of download Instagram from playstore still my app is outdated,1

"Hey, I am using insta since long time and it is a most entertaining app so far. But since fue days I am facing some issue with the aap, whenever I opened the app I got white display only. I try everything to get it back but it's not working. So I request to the Instagram team plz do something for fix it. Thank you",1
There's this glitch going on with my account where i can't post any photos that i took through my camera and i am not able to upload it in my story. I try to clear the cache too but when i try to upload them they just don't appear in the screen just a black screen appears.,1
I reinstalled the app and there's a bug now that keeps showing a white screen and soon as I open instagram and I couldn't get through my Instagram. Happened for the first time with me and the bug hasn't been resolved since the last 2 days.,1
Just started a new Instagram account didn't use the first one just wanted to follow Chris Brown and a couple other people to be honest but never really used it. So now I'm getting the hang of it and I'm not getting anything out of it it says can't refresh feed what the hell is going on with that I'm just going to stick to Facebook no Twitter tried this sucks! Facebook is home 4 me i have two pages on Facebook so going back home to Facebook hope you guys get there too cuz this is a bunch of bull,1
"Was uninstalled unintentionally by little sister and when Installing, showing can't install. Very very dissapointed if we could give zero stars then I would definitely done that. Lots of glitches and bugs. Not expecting this from Instagram.",1
"There is no ""reply"" option in direct messaging anymore. And you can't use any emoji but the ‚ô• to react",1
"if i could, i'd give 0 stars simply because this app is extremely overrated. there's apps that are way better, unfortunately though, this one gets used way more. i hate how you can barely zoom in on pictures, i hate how the quality is way worse than the actual photo is and i hate how buggy the app is. i mean, come on. it's one of the most used apps worldwide. you guys should at least invest more money into it. it's dogshit and i do NOT like it.",1
I gave it four stars but from yesterday to now it's not working. I un installed it and then re installed it. Though it's not working. When I'm trying to open the app it's turning into a blank black screen.,1
Update isn't happening to me I dunno how many times I do it things ain't working in my account. Notes aren't working,1
It seems that I'm not the only one having issues with the latest version..I tried almost everything but i still get a blank screen on my android device (samung a50) .. hope they will fix it soon !,1
"Since the latest update, I can't seem to be able to upload my photos in a group. And to find photos I've to search through so many folders to find the photos. Absolute awful update!",1
"I was using this app since 2018. But suddenly I am facing problems. Because As soon as I login, black screen is visible only....I had uninstalled and installed it various times. Please solve this glitch as soon as possible.",1
"My Instagram is working properly, The app is not refreshing any stories, feeds, posts.... Take this as report or big issue",1
"Too much loading. Network issues, story and reels can't open Pls fixed it.",1
"If I click my latest reels, the app shows reels I uploaded months ago. I contacted several times to fix this glitch but no response at all. Plus the reels reach is so down that even my followers aren't getting any impressions.",1
The app is indeed one of the best but after recent updates and taken by meta instagram went to be a horrific app it's doesnt catches network nowadays even when other most consuming apps are catching network properly I need to log in log out everytime to run it nowadays.pls fix these bugs and even the insta pro apks aren't even working properly,1
"It was a very bad experience, it automatically exits the app and after editing the photo and saving the photo is blurry and blank and not show the photo it's really disapointing.",1
The app instantly closes whenever you filter insights for a specific time period. It's been two weeks since the issue popped up and they seem not to care about it.,1
Hey help me! my Instagram is not working properly it is not showing pictures on story and not showing any filter and I am not able to add one more pic. What is this? Solve my problem. Hey Instagram I am not able to collaborate Any post solve this as fast as you can,1
Instagram is starting to become unuseful and boring. When you want to post a video of music you're playing in your background Instagram will remove it and say you're violating. If you post pictures of weed or other products they remove it EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT PROMOTING TO SELL ETC. I've been sending messages some ppl aren't getting my messages but I'm still receiving their messages! INSTAGRAM YOU NEED TO FIX YOUR APP AND STOP DELETEING MY STUFF,1
"Can not mute reels. I absolutely hate the stupid loud music people put on their reels so I mute them, but now can not. I will no longer look at any reels. Please add a feature to default reels to no audio But you don't care so why do I bother",1
"The app won't even let me log in anymore. It just shows a blank screen and when I restarted my phone, unistalled and reinstalled it like they told me to do it still didn't work. It's been about a week now and I still can't get it to work. Just a blank white screen.",1
Hi it's not working properly the story is not posting I can't receive any call it is creating many problems its take 5 to 6 hrs for uploading a story,1
It's just showing that Instagram has stopped im trying from last 3 days and no any action is taking regarding to my feedback.,1
Haven't been able to refresh my feed for weeks! The app doesn't work! I have uninstalled and reinstalled and it constantly is asking me to change my password! It works fine on my IPad but noton my Samsung phone!,1
It used to work fine but I haven't been able to use the app for over 1 month now. A bank white screen appears when trying to use it. I've reported it multiple times to instagram but they are not fixing it,1
Always glitches and has problems on days I really need to use to communicate with friends.,1
All of a sudden video quality on feed has become poor. Videos load very blurry and pixelated even in high speed internet connection. My data saver setting is also turned off.,1
"Full of scams and spams, irrelevant posts on hashtags, and the ads are just getting out of hand... Used it for years, uninstalled now....",1
"I have a lot of problems... The stories are scrolling quickly and I can't hold them and read them... I don't have '' reply ""option... I have two messages for every reply to their stories.",1
"Been able to use the 60's story. But its back to the old 30's story, and why is that? Im using Android",1
Bad experience. My account was hacked and Instagram did not do anything. Left the account to spread hacking links. I lost everything. Instagram is not a good media ! Unfortunately!!! Bad experience.,1
"Instagram is not working from last 5 days. It show white blank screen after tapping on the app... When thus problm will be resolve???? Do it faster plz. Its almost more than a month, updates are coming but still it is not working and show same blank screen problm...",1
It was all fine a month ago.. Instagram feed is not refreshing and inspite of reporting a problem there was no response.,1
"Instagram used to be good and I really used to like using this app but now it's full of bugs and glitches and with the message Instagram keeps stopping popping up, I can't hardly use the app, I even tried updating it and reinstalling the app to fix the problem but no luck, anybody having the same issue? üòï",1
"Instagram has gotten progressively worse. The forced use of Reels, the default timeline of suggested posts rather than people you actually follow has made what was one the far superior social media app on a trajectory for irrelevance. Copying the Tik Tok trend funnels people to Tik Tok and away from the Instagram platform their arrogance as a company won't let them see this until its abandoned in droves, which will come.",1
"Bring back chronological posts and photo-centric feeds. I already have tik tok, reels are annoying. And Vanish mode is confusing and totally unnecessary, too easy to accidentally turn on erase messaged",1
Hello Instagram! Yet now I don't have got new features in my account for example notes and 30 seconds story etc......,1
"keeps kicking me an locking me out of my business account. threatens to cancel my account if i dont update my password. my personal account was canceled without notice to me after 14yrs. no reason, no recourse, no debate. just boom everything gone!",1
I loved the app but after this new update they made this worst they removed save option from the stories and you cannot uplode your video only in reels you have to uplode your video both in post and in reels seriously these changes are the worst changes they made please give the save option back and another thing is allow user to uplode video as he wants so that if he wants to uplode his video only on reels not in post he can bring back these two options back,1
"Hi team Instagram, i have updated my application and done every possible thing to get swipe quick reply caption available on my account.. please help me to get this options available as soon as possible Plz solve it aa soon as possible.",1
"App completely broke down. I reset my password from PC and couldn't log in from my phone due to a black screen. Reloaded the app, cleared cache, re installed, rebooted the device. Nothing a completely black screen.",1
"""Can't continue editing"" and you're left with no choice but to scrap the post you were trying to share.",1
I have been using this for long but My Instagram is showing nothing except 'can't refresh feed' and 'community guidelines: when I click ok it is not coming and when I looked other device it shows you have been logged out and when I tried to login in it showed something like there is an error and i don't hoe to contact operator,1
My 1st experience of using Instagram is very bad I am unable to react apart from like on any perticular message & also unable to use the feature of slide and reply on message. This all feature is working on another accounts.,1
Useless update.....every time i open insta...same problem ...loding... loding...& loading....please solve this problem....,1
"Cant use the app anymore and have not been able to for over a week. All it loads is a black screen upon launching (sometimes shows ig logo). I uninstalled it, reinstalled and its still the same.",1
This Review is only for story length. It Should be 30sec. Few day ago we were able to share reels of up to 30secs directly in the story but it's now back again to it's previous version. Afterall Story Is Most Used Feature of Instagram and It Should Be long enough to describe something.,1
Instagram was only promoted that video shoot in DSLR camera but normal phone camera videos was not promoted and not viral when we have very good act but no response in Instagram app so please generate the guideline only accept video DSLR camera otherwise don't use this app please please generate this guideline on Instagram nobody can use Instagram when he have not DSLR video,1
"Don't know whats wrong with instagram. All my drafts videos disappeared . Though i didn't deleted , i was seeing in the afternoon also. I didn't found any video that too latest in the evening. Too much disappointed. üò≠",1
I can't see videos and photos that others have sent to me even though there is nothing wrong with my Internet connection please check out this problem and solve it ASAP. Now the app keeps closing down and getting out of my accounts!!,1
"My account got deleted. When it said I had 30 days to reactivate it, I did the whole process only to find my account deleted. Now my username and info doesn't exist, so stupid.",1
"Support for Instagram is non existent. It's had a bug for me for several days. Having reported the issue i was hoping to hear back from the support team, but alas no. If you are trying to be like TikTok, then perhaps you should start by replying to your customers and fixing their problems.",1
"My instagram account was hacked .The hacker changed everything like email, phone number or password.I have my own photos in account.Please fix it as soon as possible.",1
I hate this app because when we see stories it gives lots of ads and when we see the post or video of them whom we followed it give lots of suggestions which I don't want,1
"not u suspending my account because it somehow ""didnt accept terms and conditions"" when you didnt even show them to me. this happened on my computer too. if you keep doing that theres no reason for me to use your app if it keeps doing that. stop this from happening please otherwise its jut a waste of my time",1
"It kicked me completely out of my main account on Instagram and every single time I try and it says ""Unadle to complete your registration please try again in a moment"". It's been about 2-3 weeks now and I've been trying and it still won't let me log back into it",1
"Sometimes the first photo in my feed will just disappear. When I try to find them through ""following"" feed, it'll show much older posts first. Sometimes it won't even show the pic that just disappeared. Bugfest.",1
Hello Instagram Team my Instagram chat swipe reply feature not showing. please fix it as soon as possible. Thanks.,1
"I can't log in , in my account .. After filling all the log in details it is showing 'error there is problem passing your request' and after several attempts I am unable to log in back in my account .. Fix this issue as soon as posible ... Not expected this issue from a decorated socail media platform ... Fix this issue so that I can relogin in my account back",1
It neither sign up nor got me logged in! It's becoming a worst application day by day. Please fix it! üòí,1
Are you forget developers to add the download option while share other peole post to the story and have there a option to download the clip.,1
Not working properly. It takes much time for buffer. Also while doing any hashtag on post gives troubles...,1
Its nice but the recent new feature is a mess all options of name disappeared when i tried to send videos and reels to send it i have to search everytime its such trouble to search every single time only the option of add to story is available,1
Pathetic app Unable to signup either through Facebook or by number... Same message pop out everytime (Please wait a few minutes before you try again) Ridiculous üò°,1
Tecently the app stopped working on my android (after working for years) and keeps crashing. Multiple times I've deleted and reinstalled the app with nothing working. Seeing as I use it for work and events this is unacceptable,1
Such a worst experience. Everytime I'm facing the same problem. Im not getting any feeds and also dm. Once logged out and re login even uninstalled and reinstalled the app still facing same problem. I even changed password for many times still no use. Even I reported a problem but I didn't get any response.,1
"I'm having trouble logging in to my account. I tried several options by resetting passwords thru email & mobile number. I uninstall & reinstall the app but still not working, it says ""Sorry there was a problem with your request"". What the heck? Please fix this issue!",1
"I ask Instagram to improve the Instagram application more broadly, because for me the device I use is the Oppo A12 (Android media version and below) there is a bug when using the dark mode feature, the location of the bug is when I open the link from Instagram and return to the application Instagram again there is a bug that bothers me (device users with android media version and below), and for upload quality on scrolls, stories, post photos/videos, try to fix it for the better please:""",1
This is a waste app no one responding my report in instagram. my Instagram messenger is not working properly.i can't send emojis on chat and there is no themes .,1
"Uhmm hello?? Do yall even look at these reviews?? Something is wrong with the app. When you log in, there's nothing but a blank white screen, if not more ACCORDING to the REVIEWS! I am not here to bash, but if you're going to have a certain expertise in a certain field that requires technology; I'd think you'd you all have the courtesy of even stating to us there's been a glitch or so like you do everything else Online. . But I ain't said nothin. Fix the arising issue, please.",1
I am facing so many problems... even i can't update it....where as.. there is a update version of it.... i can't see note option in my account.,1
It's been a month and I am trying to install the app on my phone. It installs and when I open the app it's a black blank page. Idk how long it takes IG to fix this bug. I am very disappointed,1
"Why do you force us to follow everyone and show us nothing of our notifications ? My notifications consist of follow 300 people that I do not know or had a conversation with or seen there photos but I can't get my own notifications about who liked something on my photo or profile follow , anything would be better then to see every single person on Instagram I'm suppose to follow when they will not follow me .. If I did that all I would have is people I follow with nothing for me",1
Instagram music is not available is your device. Maximum times I face that problem in the reels. Fix this. I watch 90% of my insta reels without sound. Why sound is not supporting in my device?? I am using an Android phone which is expensive.,1
SUGGESTION (1) Sort by date followed latest earliest not working (2) Please give an option to select only recommended posts stories reels videos from selected accounts among the followings Please give an option to hide followings from followers,1
"it was the only social I use to like, but one on 2/3 post is now sponsored, and they recently added payed membership.. This suck, bye Instagram we had a good time. RIP",1
What is worng with instgram why I am not able to upload the reel on my story. Fix this problem it just keeps showing loading nd nothing else,1
"I want the old instagram, the current instagram is very silly and troublesome. I have to uninstall and install multiple times in the same day and it always loads. I remember that only my Instagram is like this but after I read the comments on the play store, it turns out that everything is the same. please fix it as soon as possible",1
"The new feature on DM is really annoying. We got stories on timeline, and now this.",1
Too many crashes lately and the version has degraded it seems. I have deleted and installed again several times and still this is happening. Very bad experience.,1
It full of scammed people looking for gift and money a lot fake profits I was blackmail it shake me up they never done nothing to help. I delete it some good people there mostly fake people,1
There is no way to contact customer service when you have been hacked and totally locked out of your account. Won't even let you delete the your hacked account or get access to your pictures. Need better customer service. One on one contact. You have to make a new account & start all over. Easy goodbye to all your pics. No access what so ever,1
What's wrong with my Instagram music? I can't find songs that I want. Please check & fix it. Thanks.,1
White space in my pic. No matter how many time I adjust it. Its crooked to the side and white space.,1
"Pretty bad at the moment. Not getting my notifications for messages, until sometimes when I go into the app and I get them all come through at once. Please sort this out. Have logged out and uninstalled already and no change",1
"It is not working in my phone.....I have already sent a feedback to the Instagram customer care service but they have not fixed this problem yet.....what are they doing....I am unable to play reels, stories and etc. etc....so fix this problem otherwise I will uninstall Instagram.....",1
When we blocked account.... beside the delete one...is very irritating and automatically chat will be deleting......it was a big problem with instagram... Updated version is not nice..and change' the options.... unblock to delete.... delete option will be chat out side.... don't keep it beside the unblock acc.....üò°,1
It has so much bugs and Instagram won't fix it!! I cant see my recently deleted stories!! I'd give it 0 if I can!!,1
"Instagram not work properly . Data is running very slow, message is not going through",1
"App will randomly reset the home screen to the top, so you will forever lose anything you were watching at that moment. Actively promotes doomscrolling by starting to show you posts by people you don't follow after it thinks you have seen all new posts on your home feed, making it hard to find older posts again (That's what the discover section is for). Bad algorythm for discover section (either all the same or irrelevant content) Too many irrelevant ads. Full of: Bots, Spam, Scammers.",1
"I'm just being honest here. I used to like this app but now it's becoming a knock off version of tik tok. Now when I post my own pictures with music, it now keeps saying ""song not available"" but yet it still shows in my recommended. What a shame. This app is also heavily laden with glitches and bugs that (may) not ever get fixed. And this is why only one star still remains. I wish I could give -1 star.",1
When I first started using it it worked great. Now a serious amount of advertising. Ignoring that I can't post anything the last few weeks. Keep sending error reports and still no response... I'll be shopping for another way to share my photography.,1
Instagram please help I love the app everything had been great until a few weeks ago when I logged out and a black screen popped up and would not let me log back in I've tried everything literally and it's still not working and come to find out it's not just me.i can still log in on Google and other phones but it's like mine had crashed.PLZ FIZ THISS!!!!,1
"The reels editor is so bad, not very user friendly and my videos always lag while editing, despite having a full wifi and data connection and cleared cache/storage, as well as an updated app. I follow people but never see their posts, and my followers never see mine. In an effort to compete with TikTok, IG is ruining the one thing that defines their brand: photo sharing.",1
"i cant log in or sign up. the screen is turning white, so i decided to uninstall and install it to see if it will do something but it just made it worst. whenever i open my instagram all i can see is white, i also restarted my phone couple of times, and clearing some cache but still, extremely poor performance from the app.",1
The app has a random mind of it's own for auto refreshing my feed and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to turn it off! It refreshed as I'm actively scrolling or if I return to the app even if a few seconds pass.,1
"Prior to me logging out of my accout last week, Instagram was working fine. I have cleared cache, cleared data, powered off then powered on my phone, uninstalled then waited 72 hours to reinstall only for the mobile app to continue showing a blank/white screen when I attempt to open the app. Please fix.",1
"Horrible support experience. Technically there is no. They omit all contact details so you only have help articles to go off, which are as unhelpful as they get. Can't login on mobile with error message telling me to wait a few minutes, but still can't login after 3 days. But have nowhere to go to ask for help, so awesome.",1
Since the update I am unable to post stories here...if vdo is for 18 sec then the next story part automatically gets deleted it shows an error occurred for every single time...don't update the application if you can't carry out it properly just go with something normal rather than going with something extraordinary without looking out for it..also I'm unable to open pictures in dm why is that happening...just getting worse day by dayüòêWill you fix the problem? Stop turning a blind eye!,1
"The recent update made the app worse. I am now unable to post multiple photos from my recent photos. For whatever reason, the app doesn't even recognize my default camera folder anymore either; I have to look for it in ""other.""",1
"What's wrong with the new update? I can't use Instagram at all. I can't refresh my feeds it shows blank screen. I have tried reinstalling, clearing caches and also turned on/off phone nothing works and now instagram is showing this message "" Just a moment while we set up English ( United Kingdom ) "" and when i set it up to English ( US) it still doesn't work. Please fix this issue asap! Really dissapointed.",1
"I am an influencer and run several accounts. In Jan22 the bubble that lets you edit video duration, that appears in the lower left corner when you add clips to reels, disappeared from my Instagram. I reported this issue several times, after 7 months it remains broken. Making Instagram content is my job, and I really loved the app. But when this remains unfixed it forces me to only make content for Instagrams competitor's. Its really unfortunate that they value new users over their existing ones.",1
"Took a break from social media, re-download the app and its a black screen every time you try to open it. I have tried everything and have Uninstalled it and reinstalled it many times over the last week and still isn't working.",1
"Somethings going on, I cannot view my archived stories. I have tried uninstalling, clearing the data and cache, and in several locations with known strong wifi/data coverage. However the archived stories fail to load each time. Please help!",1
"Its not working properly anymore! It crashed, same as the other reviews whenever i open my instagram app; it only shows me a black screen. I tried to uninstall/install the app and its still the same! It's not working! So annoying.",1
It needs High speed like 4g(full coverage) or wifi. We can't find network everywhere. It consumes more data and battery power compared to other apps. It has mostly with Hindi songs. India has so many languages and try to add atleast evergreen songs of other languages.,1
"I deleted the app a few weeks ago to take a break from it. Today, in a moment of weakness, I decided to reinstall the app, but when I open the app all I get is a blank screen. Thanks for helping me to keep my resolve, Instagram. Also if infinite scrolling on my feed was able to be disabled I would not have deleted in the first place. I want to see posts from people I follow, but before I know it I am scrolling through posts by random people, fueling my addiction.",1
"It's ridiculous to tell that at first I wasn't able to add music to my posts and stories + last when it lagged and I re-downloaded It's showing white screen it's been a month now.... After that when I loaded instagram lite it worked, but it also is now not working... I can't open my dm's ...useless.. I reported problem many times but I never got response.... Bad service I don't even want to give 1 star üòëüòëüò°üò°",1
"For over a month the apps not worked. It's just white screened me. I've unistalled, and then re-installed and restarted my phone. Done this both on WiFi and on the mobile data. Ive updated my phone, ive waited for Instagram to update and I still doesn't work!!! Driving me insane.",1
"I never write reviews, but this app has become a joke. I moved abroad 2 months ago and ever since then Insta has been horrible! How can an app claim to be one of the top social media's when it takes me over 10 tries to load and enter the app... I've been using Insta for years and it's my main communication app back home but lately I can't even use the app for scrolling past 5 photos. This app needs a serious overhaul.",1
"Since 30 days whenever i click picture on Instagram ,it makes picture to full exposure of white shade and brighten up a lot. I did many possible things but not happening.this is clearly Instagram bug and in updates too its not working. I have stopped using Instagram camera .Thats major failure being a Instagram end user as insta camera is very perfect but now its not upto the mark",1
"....same as the thousands of people who can't use the app and are experiencing a blank screen no matter restarting, redownloading, etc. This has been happening for users for over a month. Figure this out Instagram developers!!!!! Very annoying.",1
"There is a bug, the app crashs if we try and open the ""Seen"" of stories, if we try to open a profile of anyone from the stories reshared. If we try and open a page from any post, it would keep buffering the posts, opening some DM would crash the application. Over all touching the app would just make it crash.",1
WHY DO MY REELS KEEP FAILING??? Everytime I try to create a reel with trending audio it glitches and tells me there's some error. It'll refuse to upload and won't give me a reason why. I keep trying to make more engaging reels but this bug won't let me. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND ANNOYED BY THIS. FIX THIS ISSUE PLEASE!,1
I can't post images from my camera roll?? I have multiple accounts and I can't post multiple images from my camera roll. I can only select 1 at a time. The only options I'm given in the app are to post from my Instagram gallery. Why tf would I want to do that?? What kind of weird feature is this. Also hate the new feed. Just show me who I'm following by default - it's why I follow them!!,1
"Deleted my previous review, changed to 1* this app is horrible, trying to be tiktok #2 when the people who built this app when is was small PHOTOGRAPHERS are being hidden and pushed down the feed in place of reels. I'm hoping for a new competitor app just for photo sharing and stories, no videos at all.",1
"Like most others are experiencing, the app is going straight to a white blank screen upon login. This is very frustrating and needs to be fixed. Update, just downloaded instagram again to check and see if it works and it has been fixed.",1
"I am not sure about this update... But it sucks! I am a small business owner and I have to post daily! I can't upload, refresh or even do a stupid reel, like they want! My posts never load and when I retry, it's not saved in my drafts, I have to do it all over again for it not to upload again. What is going on? INSTAGRAM IS NOT TIK TOK!!! I love talking pictures, I love looking at pictures! Let's keep it that way! And by the way the customer service, blows, I never get a response back!",1
"My app hasn't been working for four weeks. Every time I open it, it's just a blank white screen. I've deleted and reinstalled it many times, changed my password etc. Nothing works, it's really affecting my business and it's extremely irritating.",1
"Instead of trying to be tiktok, maybe focus on fixing the damn issue of not giving us the ability to ACTUALLY USE IT. Ever since 9am, July 29, 2022, I haven't been able to text, post, comment, like or view stories. Not to mention i can't refresh anything. Fix the damn issues, insta.",1
The recent update is very buggy. It crashed my OS in infinix note 10 with Android 11. My phone keeps on getting restart by itself. As soon as i uninstall Instagram it gets back to normal. If I reinstall Instagram and run the app it's starts again... Now I m using Instagram update version dated before 15 aug 22. Now it is working fine... Kindly fix this...,1
"I have used this app for YEARS never have I ever had such issues. Recently, and to Current day I cannot access the app all I have it a black screen. I have followed every step and process stated to override it and still a black screen. Highly disappointed being this has been an avenue to leverage clientele",1
"I have notifications issues lately about the direct messages. Sometimes I don't get notified until I check the app by myself! This app is just getting more complex, more confusing and pretty hard to manage. A lot of useless new featurings.",1
"This app is just so stupid, Some of the filters don't work properly, it glitches and slows the app down when you use them and when it comes to posting stories, it takes so long to post or doesn't even post at all, I have to Uninstall and then reinstall the app over and over but that too doesn't solve it, very pathetic of Instagram.",1
"After removing ability to send pictures to few people at the same time after making that pic, insta dropped from my top 5 Daily used apps (avg. screen time 40-60 min per day, I used to have days of 2h+) to 0-3min per day. Insta is just worse snapchat/facebook now.... Algorithm is okish, but again it will prioritize showing you random stuff instead of pictures made by your friends even tho you have not displayed them. Removing good features does not fare well for insta future",1
"This app makes no sense when it comes to the edit a photo and sharing someone else's video and/or photo directly back onto Instagram as I've just discovered today. I'm just astounded at the moronic avenues one must take in order to do what should be a quick and simple task. Wow. If I must jump through stupid hoops to do it, it's not worth my time. I suggest you find someone who knows what they are doing. This review shall stay until this entire process becomes smart. Good day.",1
"Before Instagram was really good, everything was alright, but now it's having so many errors, when I open my account it's only loading, when I refresh my account page the changes doesn't show. The messages I send took too much time, even I changed the data and wifi nothing works.",1
swiping is not working for replay I've been using Instagram for a long time now and noted that the updates aren't been happening properly on my device. The DM's aren't properly working on my insta. I can't reply or react to a message that's sent to me. I tried uninstalling and installing the app and also tried updating. Seems none of them worked. The tech team has to work on the app efficiency and remove the possible bugs present.,1
"Buggy, clunky, riddled with ads for things you have no interest in and rarely see the people you actually want due to the aggressive and irrelevant algorithm. Constantly crashes, and full of bots messaging you which they don't seem interested in stopping by banning the actual pages behind the bots ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1

Currently still have bugs when u try to edit using Instagram and post as story and the result turn out very bad and all the wording cnt read at all...",1
"Don't sign out with this new update. Youll more than likely get a blank white screen. You can try and reinstall the app, doesn't matter. The blank white screen won't go away. Update phone, still wont update. Update app, still won't work. Seems like the quality of people being hired at meta is declining.",1
"Unnecessary Blank space in bottom has appeared and footer is came upside so screen is become smaller since months, after opening photos in dm, send and other options are gone and must close the conversation to send text. Vanish mode is not working sometimes. Reported many times but it is not fixed till now",1
"My word. Instagram has died. I mean, lost its soul, by being TikTok, putting adverts, to think you are on YouTube. And now trying to compete with Microsoft by creating their own version called, Black/White screen of death. Having to use the browser to access the App, when the App itself can't function on its own. Baffles me the most. I'm not holding my breath though. Looking at the comments left by others, this might take months to fix.",1
"Privacy concern: Contacts exclusive to whatsapp are showing as suggested and this app has no permissions enabled. The send to list is messed up, with a completely random order that keeps changing. All Facebook apps are terrible, it was just a matter of time before this one was ruined.",1
"Uninstalled and reinstalled but it won't stop crashing. When it does open it keeps reminding me I can do things that I already know (mention others in stories) or that I would never want to do (cross post to Facebook), or trying to make me link messaging with fb messaging, which I absolutely do not want. Stop trying to be TikTok or force FB interactions & just work, please!",1

"Some times, the message of mentioning someone doesn't reach the mentioned person. Very often, they are unable to repost the stories in which they are tagged in.

When i press the button""contact if you don't see the code"",the page for claiming the ads ac back (if it get stopped accidentally) pops out. I must have the ad ac to ask a question. So what should i do when i have a problem with the paying method while i haven't get an ad ac??",1
"Not sure why it keeps saying it can't be installed on my device when it also says that my device is compatible with the new version. I keep trying to download it and it got downloaded but when installing, after awhile, it's failing. I've been trying so many times now in different times and it's been a week or so since I tried first time. I have it on my older Android device. And this one is having a hard time to even install it properly. I wonder why?",1
"App not working correctly. I've restarted, reduced my saves, made room and cleaned out storage...nothing has helped. Nothing else on my phone is acting up so it's definitely instagram. It doesn't update and load things correctly. Just spinning and trying to work but not working",1
"UPDATE: Pixel 6 Pro and Instagram do not work together. Lag, distorted video uploads, videos uploading upsidedown, blown audio, and now constant crashing. If you use Instagram (ESPECIALLY FOR WORK) do not buy a Google Pixel. Original: Insane front camera lag on Pixel 4 XL. Been like this for weeks. Phone has plenty of memory. No issues with other apps utilizing the camera. Why!? Tried reinstalling. Nothing.",1
"Unfortunately, after a long years of use I am getting many troubles with mostly voice recordings. I am not able to listen voice recordings. Even I restarted my phone but still not able to listen. Please fix this bug and then i can return my 5 star review. Device is an android.",1
"After the update, the Instagram keeps showing videos and pictures to my explore videos that I am not interested to see. Before my explore was all about makeup, curly routine and outfits but now it's all about houses and unrelated stuffs. Please fix this, I want the ig app before. This is hard for me to use.",1
"I cant upload images at all. Everytime I try to post any pictures it simply says unable to load. Ive tried restarting my phone, clearing the cache, changing my network. Nothing. Apprently this is happen to other users on many different levels because of the new update. For the love of god take away this update the app is literally unuseable.",1
Never ending list of issues. Constantly there is something not working. Today the app all of sudden does not read the memory or so card. Then locked out . Then tagging removed . It's really difficult to also get support. Avoid if possible,1
The app crashes after a few seconds when opened. this happened after an update of the operating system to android 12. app has been reinstalled on the device. confirmed that the same issue is reproducable with multiple other users that also use android 12 on their phones.,1

I've used this app for years with little to no issues. Until today. My app updated and now I cannot upload pics for posts. The pics are in my phone but the app will only access my Instagram album which are pics I have already uploaded. Not cool when trying to send a shout out to a small business for the fantastic item I received.,1
"I own my dog's page and whenever I'm editing a reel, the app always shuts (it happened 5-6 times) and even if i edit the reel video in some other software and add audio through Instagram there's always this buZzz sound (it keeps coming) before the final upload.

"Android is an afterthought... If you post something with less than stellar network connection it stalls for ages. You can't even know if the post is going through, or what is happening. You can't even cancel a post ongoing. Incredible poor quality across the board from one the biggest company in tech. Unbelievable.

"I have been a huge time Instagram-user compared to other apps. But I have been facing a lot of issues lately. I have even complained to Instagram via feedbacks and other methods and yet no improvement. Lately I've been having tons and tons of issues. Today I haven't been able to use Instagram properly as the all either lagged , or kept closing. I restarted the phone, reinstalled the app, nothing helped.",1
"Whenever I click the app to check my ig, it shows nothing. It's a pitch black screen. I have restarted my phone and also deleted the app to re-install in hopes of getting the bug fixed but it didn't work at all.",1
"I had some issues with the app, I decided to uninstall and install back. Once I did that, the app doesn't take me to the soppost page, which is the login page, but rather it keeps showing me a blank page and there is no way to fix this. All this happened once I updated.",1
"I am unable to post on the app, will only let me post an option of photos I've already posted on Instagram or only one photo at a time if I go onto any other folders. Algorithm is also very bad at the moment bearly shows anything but reels and almost no content from the people I actually follow.",1
"Great! Now I can't upload any videos on my story and it shows ""couldn't upload please try again"" each time. So annoying. With every new update coming up, it's getting worse and worse! And the glitches are so frequent. THE MORE THE UPDATES, THE MORE IT GETS WORSE. PLEASE FIX THIS",1

"I have had a very frustrating experience with this application ! I have 2 accounts out of which one gets all the new features and updates. However, my main account remains redundant and does not improve visually or in terms features at all ! For example, the new story posting layout, which was released months ago, is still not available on my account. What sort of an app is this ? Not even giving a uniform experience from user to user !",1
"Why do you have such an emphasis on reels but then won't let me post any! For 6 weeks I've tried to post a reel and all I get is ""try again with a faster connection"" or ""reel can't be posted"". WHY NOT?! I've not got the fastest connection no but 20mb/s down and 2mb/s up is plenty for this. Fix your $h!t. Edit: I've now tested things on a stronger network 100mb/s download and 30mb/s upload. You're wanky app still won't post my reels, and now you've made all vids mandatory reels I can't post!",1
"From last 7 days , I'm having problem with uploading reels, whenever i post reel video goes tilted or now new problem when I'm attaching audio from Instagram noise comes from it rather than the audio... Please solve it as soon as possible. Though i send feedback and report a problem still nothing happening.",1
"My instagram isn't working for the past few days. Whenever I open it, it's showing a blank screen and I tried installing reinstalling again, clearing cache, data. Tried every possible way. But it isn't working. Very disappointed with instagram and it's services.",1
Problems with stories. Posted some stories from a concert. Woke up the next day and they're all gone??! According to my feed I don't have any current story posts but other people can see them. They also won't load in my archive. Updating the app didn't do anything. Seems to just be a problem with my account :(,1
"What the hell is going on? This used to be my fav app, now it's unusable. I can't even open the app, it's just gonna close on its own the moment I click on something. This has been going on for a few days now. I have tried everything. Clear data, reinstall the app, EVERYTHING, the issue is still there. Please fix ur all quickly or else it will die very soon.",1
Tramendous constantly annoying bug which Instagram has with Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus device (and more Galaxy devices from what I've read): When my smartphone configured in Hebrew and I define Instagram in English ‚Äì The app just doesn't remember it ! Everytime I get into the Instagram it shows me the language of my device. The problem is not with Samsung but with Instagram. It's about time to do something about it. Please fix it !!! üò°,1
"Since the Monday update there has been nothing but issues with the app. Reels won't post audio/songs, just distorted static. Can't view insights as it crashes the app every time. It also keeps disconnecting from the relevant FB page.",1
Extremely pathetic üò° all the time some sort of issue keeps occuring .. I'm not receiving notifications for a long time not i have updated it tried installing again and what not .. but still it's not working sometimes app get slow .. doesn't load the feed .... It keeps hanging ... Quit itself .... üò°üò°üò° Feedup of all these problems,1
"It's not working properly. Problems differ as I log in my account from different devices , sometimes the latest updates aren't available, and sometimes the app does not work properly. Things are all messed up here even the desktop version of Instagram is worse . Do something with this application or else it would be proven as waste of money as many influencers trying to reach their dream fan-count .",1
This is such a disaster. So many bugs are there which is not countable also. With Every updates these bugs keeps on increasing rather than decreasing. And 60 sec story feature I have not got yet. I would suggest to use instander in place of this app. Free of bugs and with many features. This was not expected from apps like insta. Improve your services.,1
App is garbage. Constantly not adding my videos and force closing. It also degrades Android photos and videos while not doing the same to iPhone pictures and videos. And I have a pixel 6. Which has a really good camera. AND THIS APP IS THE WORST TO CREATE CONTENT ON. CONSTANT GLITCHING,1
"Way too much advertising on this app! It used to be ads-free and now you got greedy! Also it's full of fake profiles everywhere, instagram has no control over them... And I keep getting added to group chats by random fake accounts over and over with no option to deny getting added to group chats by people not in my followed or following lists. Furthermore, the new look which forces me to view random people's posts instead of my older post by default is terrible",1
"A lot of bugs, i will address some issues in this app. 1. Photo quality gets terrible after posting, looks very pixelated. Reels has the same problem 2. Black screen when I try to login or sign up for a new account (still ongoing and the most annoying, UNFIXED bug.)",1
"Trying to be a tiktok clone. Between the suggested (mostly promoted ads) on my feed instead of chronological feed of photos from people I actually follow, focusing on videos instead of photos Instagram has now become a secondary place to dump your content for that little bit of extra engagement. Facebook is the place where 2 week old twitter memes go and now Instagram is the place where 2 week old tiktok videos go. You can't keep copying your competitors and be surprised you're second best.",1
Instagram is simply getting worse with each update. Upload speed is incredibly low. Had an awful experience today where my vid got stuck for hours. Had to uninstall n reinstall again. Now it's just a blank page. And there are way too problems to count on this comment.,1
"The best social media app... ... until it became a black screen, app doesnt work when i open it. had to resort to using Instagram Lite and using chrome but both are alot slower and with less features. PLEASE HELP to fix the issue (i have alr tried to restart my phone, clear cache, reinstall the app but the problem persists)",1
"Let me start by saying that instagram is my choice of social media, and I would otherwise give it 5 stars, I only give it 2 now in the hope that it may get some attention and someone can help resolve my issue. Last week the app started to crash upon opening, it would flash up the feed then just shut down it did that about 5 times now it just shows a black screen. I've rebooted, u installed and reinstalled... just keep getting the same black screen. Reducing to 1 star as no reply and app unusable",1
"Problem with only ONE account (my other one is fine) - it started playing up yesterday. The only thing that works is my notification bar. -home feed will not load, it is completely empty, including stories. - my desktop app has the same issue -all my DM conversations disappeared, can't see if someone messages me. -cannot edit my profile Help me solve this issue. I've restarted my device, reinstalled the app, relogged, changed password, cleared app cache, no result.",1
Hey guys! Ever since instagram crashed a few days ago I‚Äôm unable to use instagram at all. When I try to start the app it just shows a black screen. I‚Äôve tried everything I could find online. My phone is fully updated. I‚Äôm using a Samsung galaxy s22 ultra if it matters. Do you guys know any solutions or is anyone else having the same issue? Thanks in advance!,1
"List of bugs 1. Reels blocks every time ( at half of the reel or at 2 seconds ramained from the end) - Frustration dor the user. Replicates 4/5 times in a row. There is no work around (close app, reopen reel won t work). 2. Photos in groupchat over 5 persons loads really hard or dosen t load at all. On mobile date loads photos slow. On wi fi dosen t load at all. It dosen t happen usually, it happens from time to time. Lets say 2 from 5 photos send have this problem. Huawei P30/ latest os.",1
"Nothing is working... Its down for 2 days now. Im not able to send any messages and im also not able to view any messages. Its just showing ""sending"" but is never getting sent. Im using insta on chrome. But im not comfortable with using it on chrome. Please fix the problem on my app. I reported the problem too but i dont know when it will get fixed",1
"It was a good option for free time a time ago but suddenly something happened and I got only black screen after opening the app still got the same issue of black screen, Get it resolved ASAP. I have also deleted it again downloaded multiple times but nothing happened, Kindly go through it and try to overcome the issue.",1
"I have no idea if it's from the new update or what, but I can't even open the app anymore. It doesn't load, then crashes and closes. I've never had this happen before in the 6 years I've used the app. Absolutely unusable in it's current state",1
I want to give half star rating only but there's no option to do that. Because the latest updates are causing me to unable to post any video recorded stories & couldn't capture any pictures/photos using the instagram's camera itself. I could upload videos & images from another app to stories but couldn't record/snap pics directly from instagram's own camera. Whyyy??! Can u pls fix it really99√ó soon??? Im getting tired with all of this bugs/nonsense. Been using igs since 2015 alrdy,1
"Unusable. All I get is a white screen in the app. I've Uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted my phone, tried every other troubleshooting suggestion online. Nothing. Been this way for months. Incredibly frustrating and embarrassing while trying to use this social media to network.",1
Arrow to post photos will not work. It says processing and then doesn't go to the next page. When you try to click arrow again nothing happens. It will not save as a draft as well. Still waiting for the Ashby filter to come back,1
Very pathetic. My Instagram has been logged out automatically and now im not able to open Instagram on my one plus 8 android phone. I dont know why its happening on my phone. I have reinstalled Instagram app many times but still its not even opening on my phone. Only white screen is showing after tapping on Instagram app after successful installation. Pathetic app. Do check and resolve my issue.,1
"I'm very much disappointed Instagram. The features sometimes doesn't work and most of all pictures don't get saved in my phone's gallery like before, stories are getting saved without music. I dunno what's wrong.",1
"I was locked out of my account, and I followed their process to do the ""video selfie"" to get it back but the video fails to upload every time. It's been a week of trying, and there's NO WAY to reach out for more support. I guess I'm just not going to use it anymore then. I wish I could get them to delete it, but I need to log in for that.",1
"While Instagram used to be my main social media app, the new algorithm has completely ruined it, starting when they switched from a chronological feed. I use Instagram to follow very specific interests, but now due to constant suggested posts and ads I rarely see the PHOTOS I want to see and am instead wasting my time with useless videos that for some reason Instagram thinks I want to watch. Every app does not need to be tik tok",1
"This app is so disgusting. After uninstalling I can't login to my previous account, I can't even create a new one. I think Instagram should solve this problem as soon as possible. I have tried all methods to login but none worked. I've given the right password but they are showing (error).. I mean WHY MAN?!?!",1
"The app is faulty when you want to create content. They make it difficult to understand why your videos get restricted or how to prevent it, and it is not clear how to follow the process to recover those videos. The design is full of dark patterns.whe you start the app and see a content you want to read, it quickly dissappears.",1
"When I click on a reel on the discover page, it brings up an unrelated different reel. The actual reel I clicked on will be below, when I swipe up, but it's besides the point. I'm being forced to see content that I don't want to see, that I'm not clicking on. Why? It's stupid.",1
Very disgusting app. I'm not able to reply individually to a text while in a chat. It's from the beginning. Hold to reply option not seen. Reaction on a message option is also not seen. I uninstalled it and re-install but isn't work. Pls fix the glitch.,1
Someone hacked into my ad account for my business profile and I've tried to verify it's not me but they refuse to do anything and now I can't boost my posts. They also don't have any customer support or contacting system which is ridiculous. The app also crashes every other day on top of everything.,1
"Recently the experience is very very bad.. Instagram is not responding and when I tried to use it, the app get closed in few seconds ... I removed it and installed it again as a result again it is also not responding , a notifications is coming that Instagram is having bug... Please fix it...",1
"Very boring, repetitive. Instead of seeing new posts from people I follow it's nothing but suggested posts and ads. My timeline is basically the same thing as my explore page at this point and it's not enjoyable anymore. I never see content I follow people for. Everything is brands and influencers and it's exhausting and boring.",1
It's useless...there are no options to reply on specific messages... I guess its been more than 3 months and i even reported problem about that... but you guys didn't fix it.. its useless... would like to give 0 star... You should delete this app form play store... üôÇ Even some musics are not even available in my region... Such a waste/ trash app... hey please fix my issues.... why you don't understand.... I am frustrated now......,1
This app used to be really good but lately it doesn't work properly anymore. For example there is an error and it kicks people out of the app randomly and lately it doesn't even let me log in anymore no matter what I try. Quite dissapointing.,1
The app keeps clashing. Reinstalled and not able to log back in. Made a video reel and the music is not available after publishing. Such a disappointment. Why did you allow people making reels with an unavailable music in the first place?,1
There are too many bugs in the app after update. My followers count gets stuck and I have lost track of the increase vs what shows in the app. Very sad. Specially when are focused on it from a business point of view.,1
"Awful app with a broken algorithm. I see hardly anything from the accounts I follow, while my feed is filled with knock-off tik toks that I have zero interest in, all using the same three audio clips about how much they hate reels. My own posts get shown to 5% or less if my followers, even friends and family don't get to see them most of the time. There is nothing ""social"" about this app anymore, it's turned into a garbage content mill that serves as an ad delivery system.",1
"Really disappointed... Keeps on disabling my account, I can't upload captions, my captions keep on disappearing and insta keeps on taking down my posts ... Seriously if you're enough stressed and frustrated don't go down this path ... I have never been stressed and let down my whole life... Please Instagram do something about it.. Help us with the problems instead of giving more stress.",1
My Instagram application isn't working from past few days... it's motionless and a black screen is viewed always... I'm unable to use Instagram in my android though it's showing the version is up to date and works on this android.I have tried number of times restarting my mobile and also uninstalled and installed the app many times...but it's of no use ... Please look into this issue and let the users know some information regarding this issue.Hope you consider this.,1
"The app is brillaint but the latest problem is that I am unable to login to my accounts as there opens a blank screen and then I am unable to login in any of my account. No login windows appears, nothing. Please fix this issue as it is important and urgent. I have seen alot of people are facing this issue while logging in. Tried clearing cache, reinstalling application, even checked my internet connection 100 of times but all go in vain. Please suggest a way out to this and fix this issue.",1
"Used to enjoy it Used to use the app to share my Arts n crafts with friends & family, plus new people that share same interests, until app became unstable. Will crash several times on opening the app. If you get on, ADS galore! Scroll through 5 ads before seeing 2 posts from those I follow. When trying to post multiple pics of work, can only choose 1 and like it... Providing the gallery opens. Now I am forced back onto Facebook where I get a lot of rude comments and jump through hoops.",1
I m just fed up of this new update. It is full of bugs. I can't see DM's & reels are not opening. There is a continues buffering. I have uninstalled & reinstall the app atleast 10 to 15 times from past 4 days & still facing the same issues. I couldnt even open storries from my connections. I couldnt search any account or anything. I didnt even get the 1 minute story uploaded update yet. Notes update is also not there.,1
"Instagram is a need so we use it otherwise this app is full of glitches and errors the system works slow , they have the reel feature but for god's sake you can never edit your reels from Instagram directly because it won't succeed, please please ,do check onto this matter or else you will lose passive video editors .",1
"Slow (message loading), unoptimized (high battery consumption), buggy (feed, profile can't load sometimes, reel creator is breaks at times, and the same is true for story creator) application. Just trash. Invest time in optimization and bug fixes for a change.",1
It has lot of glitches.... I can't see my Dm's nor can i seach any account... My reels are also not opening... I cant see or upload any stories.... I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app around 7-8 times.... I also have restarted my phone so many times.... The update has made this app so annoying.... Very very disappointed....üëé... Hope the company will sort this issue as soon aas possible...,1
"I have not been able to use the app for weeks because everytime I open it, it is a black screen. I see other reviews for the same thing, please fix this. I have tried everything, reinstalling it, restarting my phone, etc. Nothing is working and I need to be able to communicate with people. This is not fair to the people who don't have ""the newest phone"". Fix this!",1
"Horrible app. Filled with ads, They put way too much emphasis on reels and the feed algorithms are the worst. If you're a photographer, do yourself a favor and just use Vero. So much better.",1
The app keeps crashing. I tried to reinstall and i couldn't get into my account. Tried to logging it via facebook and it doesn't work. Tried to forgot password AND I DIDNT GET ANY EMAIL! I have check the spam and there is none! the support email team doesn't help at all.. sooo frustrating..,1
"instagram was very good but now they have limited who can see my pictures and consequently it's not helping my business grow very much. There's no way to contact them except by reporting the issue but even when you report nothing happens anyway Update I've downgraded my review from 2 to one star, all I get now is a blank white screen. No way to contact instagram, a truly rubbish app, tiktok and Facebook are much better",1
Bugs with reels. I don't have an option of reels play in the menu bar anymore. The pause/play button has also disappeared from reel. I can play or scroll through reels only if someone has shared it on their story and then too i can scroll through similar reels only,1
"The updates and support for Galaxy fold devices is not good. Very glitchy, video reels crash and change the aspects ratio. Idk how to explain it with out being able to attach a photo but it's all around glitchy. Update: still trash for fold series.",1
Totally garbage!!!! If you're being dependent on this disguisting app... Let me tell you plzz don't save your videos/snaps in its draft section in the hope of using it some other time... You'll never get those back ü•∫ It don't even give warning or disclaimer before cleaning up that.. Ihv lost all my drafts (memories) which i saved from last year üò≠üò≠üò≠ This is such a rubbish app... I'm just done using it... üíî,1
These past few days Instagram doesn't work smoothly for me. I tried to reinstall it but the issue still exists. Photos are not loading even the ones in my page. Most of the reels are not playing. My internet connection/speed is perfectly fine.,1
"I m not happy with this app as it does not provide the feature of swiping message reply n reactions for messages particularly in my instagram account as other people are enjoying this feature without any issue. I updated , reinstalled the app n reported this problem too but there is no change at all. Its really disapppointing!!",1
"Totally changed from when I first started to use it. While I don't mind the odd suggested post, I'm seeing more suggested reels and photos than ones from people I follow. As a result I'm using it less and less.",1
"Afret using this app for such a long time i should say that they didn't even bother fixing the problem of bad quality of pictures and videos in the stories in android devices! Imagine taking your time and taking high quality pictures and wanting to share them with your followers and after seeing your pictures with that awful quality, you just become SPEACHLESS... wow! I have nothing more to say. It's a shame for this huge company to not take care of this issue.",1
"it's worked near perfectly for the past three years, but just the past couple weeks I've been met with crashing, dms being reset, etc. and today it isn't even launching for more than three seconds. it's unusable at this point.",1
"Update 2022 - Now it's a more instrusive app that didn't recognise when is used from a new smartphone and continue having annoying bugs, definitely doesn't respect user directions. Also doesn't protect users from profiles plagiarism (only huge public figures). Seems to be more like an intrusion app with a photograph facade. Definitely not for privacy, useful for big data and profiling. Now unilaterally they close my account for no reason or warning. Sadly but I have to uninstall this app",1
Instagram is a spying application. It posts advertisements based on what we speak with other people. There is a function in the app to hear and record nearby sounds even if we disabled the access to microphone in the application settings. This is so bad.,1
"Lately Instagram is working horribly... It has so many bugs, it's slower, it makes me loose so much time because it has so many errors in the reels sections, post, adds... Everything. I really hope you guys do something to improve because it's very frustrating",1
2022/09/22 - Unable to upload any videos & absolutely dislike the fact that posting of a single video requires it to be posted as a reel - it changes the aspect ratio so would much prefer it to be up to the user as to whether they would prefer to post the video as a post or a reel instead of having it forced on you. With these two issues it is lucky that we are unable to give less than a 1 star rating as I surely would do so.,1
Please move the save button back to where it used to be. I do not like it near the send button because I do not want to DM someone a random video I am trying to save. That was a really terrible idea to implement into your already poorly run app.,1
"Horrible twofactor security, and mindless algorithim for giving you content. I never got content I actually wanted through the stories or explore page, feels like a chore. After I got a new phone to replace my old one, I had no way to confirm my identity besides uploading a video of myself. This failed twice, and I'm still left unable to login to my account. What's the point of two factor verification if it's so hard to get back into after proving identity. Gonna delete my account at this point",1
"It is very frustrating and time consuming that you remove the voice from my videos after you accepted them for several months .And please dont tell me ""copyright"" because i am taking the music from YOUR library(instagram library where we chose the music for our reels).Until solving this problem the rating for instagram is Zero !because i dont like to spend my time doing videos and after a couple of months i find them muted",1
"This app was the best but then it started showing a white screen everytime i open it, i waited for hours but it still doesn't go to the normal screen, i even cleared my ram and did EVERYTHING, but it still shows a white screen,. There were 2-3 updates after that but it still shows the white screen i even reported it but nothing changed., PLEASE FIX THIS!",1
Actually I have been using Instagram from 3 years. I have never faced any issue but now I can't even open the login page. I don't know what's wrong in it. It's been 1 month I have been trying but nothing sorted out. When I open the app it shows a blank screen!!,1
"App keeps malfunctioning. Most recently, it will not load posts and videos and message. When I open the app, its all in black screen and no way to see anything. I have Uninstalled and installed it back. Restarted my phone as well. Terrible app. I'm using an android.",1
"My account has been locked out for reasons unknown to me, and the email address it's trying to send the email to is not my email address. After many hours of searching the only ""direct"" contact I can get with support is via the developer contact listed here, and nearly 2 weeks later there has been no response email, not even an automated ""we have received your email"" one. Nothing. The developers don't care about their users unless you have a big impact on the app. Would rate 0 if I could.",1
"Update: They decided to start breaking things that used to work, and call it an ""upgrade."" Now suddenly in group chats I can't reply to messages and my only reaction option is a basic ""like."" QUIT. BREAKING. THINGS. UPDATE 2.0: I had to install messenger to restore functionality to instagram, which is highly annoying. Why do I have to install a second app to make your first one work properly, especially when it was working fine without messenger yesterday? Leaving the rating at 1* for that reasn",1
"Apparently, neither the Chrome or Android versions of Instagram want to work right at all! The videos and reels on this app have a lot of awful glitching and lagging to it, and I am not grateful for either of those things! It needs to be fixed right now! Especially on my Chromebook!",1
"A few days ago the app stopped showing my recent photos from my photo gallery. I finally figured out how to acess the photos, however it will only allow one photo to be selected, not multiple. Something is wrong. It was working fine last week.",1
The app itself runs smoothly and I rarely come across bugs. I detest the new algorithms and would like to see a commitment from the app to provide options for those of us who only want to see the content from the pages we have chosen to follow. I don't care about corn hole. Why am I seeing corn hole reels?,1
The app is updated n all but I don't get any notifications at all. Idk what's wrong. Very very disappointed.,1
"I'm unable to react to a particular message with any other emoji but ‚ù§. I'm even unable to reply to a particular message. I've been complaining regarding the same along with the screenshots, time and again but I'm not getting the issue resolved. Instagram pays no heed to the problems I report. Hence I'm giving a 1 star rating as my voice is not heard.",1
I just upgraded from the Pixel 4XL to the Pixel6Pro now my Instagram app won't load. Like it shows the Instagram logo then goes to a black screen because I'm in Dark mode. I've uninstalled app restarted my phone redownloaded app still won't work. I've restarted my phone multiple times uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I've gone in and reset the app cleared data cache and allowed all permissions restarted phone. Still nothing!! Now I can get into Instagram through Chrome but not the app.,1
"Feed isn't working after updating the app. No response from the email support as well. Stories aren't loading. Search option works, a few settings work, few don't. Own profile loads. Bugs are there in the latest update. Please resolve my issues.",1
"I ‚ù§ IG except for this week. It will not work on wifi. I have done all sorts if troubleshooting and have reinstalled three times on two different devices. After reinstall it works one time and then goes haywire again. I am in NYC, and have two friends who are experiencing the same problem. Please fix whatever us happening at the source. I think I saw there was a recent security update. I bet that is the problem.",1
"This app has gotta kinda bad. I used to love this app, I used it more than Facebook. But for the past almost year or so when I go to post on my Instagram story and put any song I type in over it, it says the song doesn't exist. I've tried updating it and it just made it worse. I'm thinking about just deleting the app altogether. I love using it but it's just gotten worse over the years. üòî",1
"It‚Äôs been three months since the last time I used this app. I uninstalled it before because of the bug which is everytime I open the app, after the instagram logo scene, you can only see white screen. It became my routine for the past months to uninstall and install it again but up until now, it only shows white screen. What‚Äôs the problem?",1
"Terrible app, App closes suddenly after few minutes of usage lost of bugs in the appüôÑThey are not providing proper update everytime they implement new things some or other problems will arise in the App , and one more thing from one week it's not opening at all i am getting blank page reinstalled many times and even restarted my Mobile. Awful experience with thisüòë",1
"I updated the app 2 days ago and now I can't be on it more than 10 minutes without it crashing! And when I x out of it and do other things on my phone, I get a notification that says 'something went wrong' twenty minutes or so. Very frusterated.",1
"In my opinion, Instagram is technically the worst video platform that has come along. Why do you need to change the video download algorithms and the user interfaces of the images to the usual one. Video quality is a mess compared to competing video platforms.",1
"I was making a reel that has text with white backgrounds, but the actual reel took away the white background on my texts, which made them EXTREMELY hard to read. Maybe add more e2e or unit tests for reels feature on android Samsung S20 devices by your next release? I am not happy because of this bug and I hope it gets solved ASAPA",1
I'm so sick of the music working and then NOT working. Then when you use music on a post it says it's blocked or can't be used. Why do you have the music for us to choose in the first place? This app grows increasingly WACK and I don't even time to mention all the other glitches.,1
Bug report:- there is bug when someone mentioned me in story or reacted on my story that message is not opening. Evertime i tap on the message application crashes. I have followed the basic trouble shooting steps cleared the data uninstalled the app but nothing working Check it once. Thanks,1
"Ever since I updated the app it's been a mess. For the longest time I thought my phone had issues with instagram to a point where I'd hop on other apps just to check if the problem is the app or my phone - only to find out everyone is having the same problem. Uploading stuff is frustrating, IG lives are lagging like crazy and Reels are so difficult to put up. I swear just get discouraged whenever I feel like posting something cool on the app.",1
People I follow will like the same post I like and then moments later it'll disappear. I'll see the comments but the like will just disappear. It was working fine until last week. Now I'm no longer able to stay connected to those whom I follow. I've reported the issues several times through the app but nothing has changed. I've uninstalled and installed it again. Still nothing. I'm changing my rate to a one until it's fixed,1
As you can see here are many people complaining about the blank screen and I do have the same problem but Instagram isn't doing anything about the problem. I can see people complaining about it for many months ago. I am curious that even Instagram is checking the reviews or not? Even if you are checking then at least reply about fixing the problem. It is waste of time for us to trying to get the app if you are not willing to fix the problem.,1
I have to manually tap through stories because it constantly freezes. It sucks!!! I used to be able to watch stories with smooth transition from one story to the next ... not anymore. Instagram fix this! üò†,1
"Worst experience ever, like seriously how come Instagram being messed up like this. After this new update, I am unable to load the feed, it is smashing on continuous basis. I am trying to load the feed, it says couldn't load every single time. Stories, profile and everything else is loading but unable to load the feed. Useless update Meta!!! Worst experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"I have some draft videos and when I post those videos after 1 day it gets posted but if when I try to post them after 2-3 days it doesn't get posted, rather it's give a pop up message like ""your video didn't get posted, please try again"". It's happen most of the times in morning or afternoon. Please fix this issue As Soon As Possible. If there is chance of giving one star i would have give that",1
The app is not loading! It was stuck to a black feed and nothing is loading at all! It's been days! I'm pretty sure I've exhausted every troubleshooting steps. Don't fool me! I work at a customer service and I know how to troubleshoot a tech issue. Please fix your damn app INSTAGRAM! you have a really poor customer service and nonexistent one! I don't even know where to contact. You deserve a nothing star!,1
"I logged out because when I'm trying to post it won't even post, takes more than 45 minutes and trust me it's not my wifi and once i logged out, i can't even log back in, when I open the app all i see is a blank BLACK SCREEN, i tried to reinstall it and nothing. I even emptied my storage thingy and restarted my phone. And nothing! Still a freaking black screen, Instagram need to fix this, same with the stupid post glitches, this has to be fix quickly.",1
Everything was okay but once i changed my account's password through my desktop. Afterwards i was signed out of my account from the app in my phone and since then whenever i open the app instead of login page black screen comes. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times but still the same problem. All the other apps apart from Instagram are working completely fine (my phone has 6gb ram) and also Instagram lite too is working fine but not the main app,1
"I've been having trouble logging into my account. I sent messages asking for help. But no response. It takes time loading, says error. I don't want to start a new Instagram page. I have all my pictures, friends family, co workers etc associated with my page. I loved Instagram before, but now I feel different about it. At least facebook answers your messages and helps solving any issues you may have.",1
"What's wrong with this instagram?? Too many bugs, to many update issues. It has too many issues now I just want to view reels not a green screen. Whenever i trying to watch a video screen turns green screen. What's wrong happening here #worst update ever. I don't get DM's, till i seperately search or refresh them in DM section. I keep uniinstalling and installing instagram too many Times but it couldn't help. Please fix that issue ASAP.",1
"Trying to create reels but the app is unable to render and process high quality/pixel photos. Just blurs them out which beats the purpose. Since reels are highly promoted, I would expect better. I keep taking down the reels since they are unclear once I've posted them",1
"Please make Instagram the way it was before, PLEASE LISTEN TO US USERS! We miss the photo-sharing only platform! Everything became worse eversince reels came.... I tried editing reels with your app but it's very buggy and taking me a few restarts to make it. Please, please make Instagram the way it was before.... PLEASE!",1
This app is absolutely terrible. It acts up a whole lot. I can't see the number of views I have on my Instagram stories. It also tends to slow while I am trying to put my reels together. There's a lot improvements this app needs to make.,1
"So, I had to get a new account because IG messed up my old one (not letting me post/interact), but even in my new one it won't let me sent photos/videos and its just forever saying ""sending..."" but it doesn't. I don't have any internet issues so this is honestly a bummer and I've had to move to other social medias just to let me send a photo or video. Very inconvenient -- UPDATE: its very difficult for me to create posts because its now saying there's ""something wrong"" when its not clear of what",1
"The reels editor is so awful. The number of hours I've wasted editing videos over and over again which when I hit publish end up with corrupted text, images, audio or missing audio, is ridiculous. Needs sorting out!",1
"Horrible I'm facing a issue science last 1 month and I've tried everything but not able fix it . on Instagram while chatting with people the system is taking automatically screenshots which I'm not authorised, it's happening very frequently . how it's happening God knows, I've sent n number of mails but not getting any response from anywhere. How it is possible and how I'm gonna fix it don't know please help me to get this done.",1
"The application has started make a block on everything and for no reason. You only communicate with my partner. No one will help you. I will delete it, because there is no way to follow, do not allow to download a story or post, I made a second account but the same problem and no one help to fix the problem.",1
07.15.22 - IG is NOT working!!! I uninstalled & installed last night bcuz it hadn't loaded/updated my feed in 10+ hours. It worked temporarily but now it's worse. It's stuck in a blurry screen looking like it's loading but it's not. I just uninstalled it again & decided to look at reviews to see if anyone else is experiencing the same problem. Sure enough I'm not the only one. Please fix! 08.14.22 - Still NOT working!!! Why hasn't it been fixed??? 09/19/22 Still Not working. Unreal!!!,1
"its been a month since i last used Instagram as usual, i've been trying to download it till this date and when i open the app, it shows a blank screen. this issue started after updating the app. in the beginning, i've tried reinstalling, clearing the cache, rebooting my phone etc. but it's still the same.",1
"I've been stuck on a white screen since August 15th. Whenever I try to open the app, a blank white screen is displayed. I have tried all the 'solutions' and attempts at fixing that I found online and nothing seems to work. Instagram please fix this issue.",1
"Since Yesterday I cannot open My Instagram account. The app is showing black screen when opened, nothing else could be done. Have uninstalled and installed the app several times. But still there is no response from the app. Kindly help, as I am missing out posting contents on regular basis.",1
"Blank white screen for the past 3 weeks when I open the App. It works fine on the computer, but I haven't been able access the app since early July. Weird how Instagram has zero support to help with the issue. Zero customer support.",1
"There shows a blank space while opening my instagram app. All I could do was install instagram lite. It gets uneasy and less optional using the lite version. I dont have any other option than stop using both apps before getting bored of instagram lite. please do something, as I have seen many reviews regarding the same and seems nothing has been done so far.",1
"Uploading interface is absolute trash. App doesnt let me upload multle photos from gallery, from main upload screen when clicking on multiple photos it instantly crashes. On computer it tries to upload post but either freezes or shows that post upload is completed but no new post visible and no explanation provided.",1
"App keeps crashing, can't edit comments, reels drafts never save properly and when you add captions MANUALLY on your reel it's all wonky once it uploads. I miss when it was only a photos app üòÆ‚Äçüí®. The fact that it also force follows people without your permission is concerning.",1
"The same blank screen problem that has been going on with everyone has struck me too. Re-installed the app for the millionth time, but to no avail. Instagram customer service is unavailable. These people really need to get on their feet and fix this!",1
"I can't even get past the log in screen even tho I already have existing accounts since 2019. I can't get any help on this situation and it won't even let me create a new account. I've tried Uninstalling then redownloading, as well as I have tried restarting my phone. I even waiting overnight and still nothing. I am frustrated and wish they had better support for these situations.",1
Every update they make the layout look and feel worse. Occasionally your preferences for your explore will completely reset with no way of reverting it. 90% of all posts on reels are accounts that bought likes to trick the algorithm and are not good content.,1
Horrible lately. Doesn't refresh. Emoji reactions to DMs doesn't work. Nothing loads though network is good and app is updated. Randomly removes music from past reels. Why even make the music available if you are planning to remove it once we used it on reels.,1
Disgusting after updating the app it has really become troublesome for me I am sick of its issues. I am unable to add the music to the post I am sharing and it is misbehaving and not uploading properly though after reporting for the same the issue is not being resolved till now if the same goes on then definitely it will loose its position.,1
"I am not able to see anything on my feed, i can't send anything I'm not able to receive any message, I tried restarting the phone I tried to re login & uninstalling the app and installing back but same issue I have report this issue as well but no response from your side I used to enjoy it so much but now it's very irritating üò©kindly fixed this asap!",1
The latest update sucks. The app crashes every freaking time. Other apps are working perfectly fine. Everytime I receive the notification that Instagram has crashed. Also I can't even watch one reel properly. And posting reels has become so difficult.,1
The unique thing about Instagram is that it was all about the photos. Instagram plz understand it's 100% ok for tik tok to be the videos... You don't have to do everything/flood the feed with random videos we didn't ask to see. That's another thing actually. Why has my feed become the discovery page. If I don't follow it - don't show me it.,1
"A new update is causing crash. When I launch app, and open stories, a pop up is shown saying ""Now you can like stories"", and app crashes. Can't navigate through it at all. It was working a couple hours ago.",1
This app only gets worse with time. Devs seem interested in copying other social media platforms rather than improving what the point of this app was to begin with. Now it feels like a lesser version of all the apps it's borrowing ideas from rather than being its own thing. It also crashes often.,1
"I've had this since 2017-18 and it keeps crashing and kicking me out, I can't hear stories part of the time and all my chats disappear until I reload it so I'm not getting message notifications 99% of the time either. A few days ago it kept kicking me out instantly after opening it",1
"The stuff it recommends glitches out so much and gives me junk that I have no interest in looking at. I have to go through and selected everything to hit not interested and wait a day for it to fix. Now, I can't even open the app because as soon as i do, it immediately closes itself or freezes my phone.",1
Good for advertising yourself but the app has alot of issues & there is many times I've had to delete the app just to get it to work. Lately Instagram has been having networking issues because it takes forever to load but all my other apps work just fine... Instagram keeps getting worse and I'm not sure why,1
"All day long it's been crashing seconds after opening. I've tried forcing the app to stop, clearing the cache, Uninstalling and re-installing, and updating the app and it's still doing it. What good is an app if you can't even open it?",1
I don't like Instagram. I can't get it to pull up my gallery albums that I want to post so there's no way to post any of my pictures. It's bad enough you can only post 10 at a time but now I can't even do that. Facebook is so much easier to use and post pictures with. But everyone uses Instagram now. I wish Instagram was easier to use and more like Facebook. Please fix this.,1
"Everytime Instagram removes any useful feature instead of adding on something to the list. Saving the story when you share some reel on it was a useful feature but as always Instagram removed it. Instead, it added absolutely useless feature of share your thoughts..it was not needed at all..we can already share our thoughts over stories and posts",1
"Not working all of a sudden! Justshowing a white plain forever! I did all you can imagine, deleting the catche, all data, exiting from beta program, reinstalling.. everything you can possibly think of it! Please help me on this! I even can't take a crush log out of it! Nothing works out of the blue!",1
"I'm having problems opening my app it's been like this since 8/9th I keep getting a white blank screen. If anyone can assist me with fixing this issue? I tried everything even uninstalled it, rebooted, made sure my phone was updated, and deleted pics/docs to make sure enough memory. This needs to be fixed I do business on there also.",1
The reel editing sucks. Why is it so inconsistent? I can't adjust the lengths of certain parts of the clip? The over simple down ui they have going on is anoying. I want drop downs and exact selections to trim and resize. Don't even get me started on templates,1
"My experience is the same with the previous reviews. All i can see is the blank screen everytime i open the app. I already did clear the data and cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but still the same, blank screen.",1
"Hi, I am unable to use app at all as it gives me blank black screen as soon as I click to open it. I am facing this issue since recent update came a month or two when once Instagram was down for sometime. Could someone please look into this issue and help me with a solution on priority??? Please fix the bug at earliest so that I can revise my rating.",1
"If I try to post multiple pictures, I can't access my folders. I can only post one picture at a time. Based on other reviews, this seems to be an issue with the app on the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. My wife is not experiencing this issue and she has the S22, not the Ultra.",1
The videos I'm trying to watch keeps buffering. The actual video would buffer but the audio would play like normal. So there's a delay in sync. It's really annoying and I can even use this app u til it gets fixed.,1
"Showing I have no stories on my end, when I do and friends confirmed they can see them, and it won't let me highlight story posts right now, and my highlights won't open. I Uninstalled and reinstalled, got stories back but not highlights. Force stopped the app in settings and now im back to have no stories. Get your s together instagram.",1
"Buggy and slow. Following a recent update, filters I have used comfortably for at least six months all suddenly stop working/crash the app every time I attempt to use them. Weirdly coincides with the launch of the new iPhone ü§∑ Shocker! UPDATE: it's still horrendous btw üòõ",1
"I've been trying to log into my account for the past hour and a half. At first it said incorrect password (even though I haven't changed it recently), then it wouldn't let me change the password. Now I managed to finally change it, and it still says Incorrect password or Can't connect to Instagram or Error - problem with your request. What is going on? I want to continue to use the app, but you're making it hard to. Please fix whatever is wrong, and give me access to my account.",1
"When I post it doesn't keep my caption for some reason, and when I try to edit it never saves, despite good wifi connection it claims im not connected, im not sure why its acting so buggy, I wanted an Instagram for a while but if this how it acts on the regular then im probably gonna drop it soon, only thing that works for me is saves.",1
"It'd give less than 1 star. The app is buggy, doesn't play videos, stories or reels, it just gets dark and every time it happens I have to restart my wifi and mobile data, erase the cache and force the app to close like 3 or 4 times so it works ""properly"".",1
"The constant spam and bots on this app is one of the most frustrating things I've had to deal with while using social media, it's the same things constantly and it doesn't matter how many times I report or block, more just reappear and you don't do anything about it? You police the type of pictures more then you police people on the actual app!!! Between the spam bots, the excessive sponsored posts and the app wanting to be tik tok, it's become total trash.",1
Instagram on my phone is not opening. It's just black blank page. Not even log in option is there! Sent them a mail but no response. It's been more than 2 weeks but there's no resolution yet! The website and kite version work fine but the App is wanted!,1
"When I open it, it shows me a Black screen. I uninstalled it and reinstall it again many times, but without fixing the problem. Kindly fix this problem. This problem since 2 weeks, and I waited till another update become available, and finally found a new update today, but also with the aame problem .",1
"I keep story on my Instagram account before 2 days ago. As per Instagram service, it will be vanished off after 24 hours but, after 2 days it is not deleted now yet. I am using a latest version of Instagram but then and then also this issue is happening with me. I think it's a technical glitch or bug. But it's making mentally harassment to me. That's why I am not concentrating to on daily life work work properly. And that's a very bad thing.",1
The application got crashed üôÑ on my vivo z1 pro phone and i am unable to you it like from past a month now . I want the support to see this as soon as possible ..... The problem is to send a bug report or problem too we have to do some stupid shake to our phone and then it will give us the drop down menu...... But the problem is this can only happen if you have login to your account but in my case i tried uninstalling and re-installing the application as written in your guideline so i can't,1
I've been sending reports to ig for ages saying one of my accounts isn't doing well lots of features are missing I'm sick of sending feedbacks repeating the same thing again and again...... Crucial features are missing like swipe right reply feature (most important among all cause if I want to reply to a message in a chat and if it got lost I have to scroll all the way up then I have to copy and paste it in my message bar like c'mon) themes and reaction feature is missing too... I beg u ig,1
"I uninstalled the app. When i reinstalled the app it only shows a blank screen when I open it. It's so frustrating!!! Please fix it as I can see from the reviews that I'm not the only one experiencing this issue, many users are facing the same issue!!!!",1
"It's been 3 months, I am unable to open this app, As soon as I open the app the screen becomes blank. I did everything possible, updated the app, re-installed, restarted the phone etc.etc. I am able to access the Lite version of the app, but not this one. This is pathetic.",1
"Used to love Instagram, was the best app, seeing photos & artists and in chronological order, was perfect. Now all i get is video's of people i dont know doing stupid stuff! Where have all the photos gone? I dont think the hundreds of accounts i follow have stopped posting photos, just Instagram for some reason thinks (wrongly) that i dont want to view them anymore. This app was way better before meta purchased it. Used to recommend, not anymore. On the look out for a new photo sharing app",1
This app doesn't know how to handle dark mode. Blocks and sections turn white where there would be white text or white icons. It's like holes in the app. And it's been like this for years and in different phones too. Very disappointing from Meta. They can't seem to fix it? Are they aware the app becomes unusable when this happens?,1
"I've suddenly been disconnected and am now stuck with an error message that just says ""there was a problem with your request"" when trying to sign in. My account is enabled, I've even been able to change my password, but I still can't sign in, and there's no way to get any help or contact support !",1
instagram is good but I had a problem. My account got disabled for NO REASON and if there was a reason they should state it. I told them it was a mistake and they did nothing about it. I am very disappointed I also lost the friends I was following on that account as well as saved info. Very disappointed AND ANGRY by this.,1
"I just can't access my account. Trying to log in from so long, even tried changing password. Nothing is working. Just few weeks back my instagram got crashed and now this. Fed up of app update too. Clearly not having any good results. Unfortunately i'll rate it 1. If i could i would've rated in minus. Please fix this bug asap.",1
"Worked very well til the most recent update. Won't let me access all of my photos when trying to post multiple images. So I'm limited to one image at a time now. Also, images posted to IG take a long time to show up in my saved IG folder, and then all of them get deleted at random times. Edit: One more recurring issue is that sometimes IG will only display a limited number (15-20?) of my previous posts. Also more ads than posts fromw accounts I follow. IG is going DOWNHILL.",1
"This is the worst app ever, I'm a pro photographer and it doesn't even let me post multiple pictures, when I select the icon for multiple pictures it only gives me the ones on my Instagram whitout the option to select from my gallery. You can only post one picture at a time. Please sort this out....",1
"My Instagram explore's messed up. These few days, It keeps showing random nature and animal pics which are not relevant in my interested posts before (anime, street food, Japan, etc.). I hope it will be fixed as soon as possible because it's not comfortable at all.",1
"Notifications for stories have not been working for 30 months, will be more soon, have not received a single answer from support ever, there are a million different bugs that have been there for years and the list is so MASSIVE that I would need way more than 500 letters to list them all AT LEAST fix the stories notifications please, even if its worth pretty much nothing by now E:32 months without a fix for anything",1
Have unistalled and installed multiple times to see if the issue would resolve. Works for opening twice and then see nothing but black screens. This is beyond ridiculous. Has been happening for over 3 months!!,1
"I tried logging into my other account yesterday but it won't work, i thought it was just because of my internet connection but when i checked it, it works just fine. I tried logging off all of my Instagram accounts to check if it'll work but then it only showed a blank screen, i uninstalled the app later and i can't log into my accounts anymore, it's just a blank screen, i tried restarting my phone and all but it still won't work. Pls fix this",1
"i just wanted to log in another account and even after pressing log into existing account it would show me a blank screen, so i re-downloaded the app and my whole ig is just a blank screen now, thankfully i remember the passwords but please fix this, there's no email address or anything to contact for help and before this the experience i had with the help center was also really bad.",1
"The app slowed down after updating it . Later while reinstalling the app , have been receiving only the white screen and cannot login through the application since past 30 days. Also received two new updates for the app but it still doesn't seem to work. Please help.",1
"Horrible. It just keeps crashing and exiting the app. I restart my phone, remove least used apps and even uninstall and it still crashes! It worked for a few months but now, it is just straight up broken.",1
"DO NOT like the way you changed video posts. They automatically post as reels. If I wanted them as reels, I would post as such. I prefer video posts over reels as it gives my intended audience more focus. Needs to be an option again...not just auto ""reel"" even after posting as a ""post""",1
"For a company that has a monopoly on social media. You have a responsibility to give a working service as a moral obligation. In the past 12 - 24 months there is always a problem with uploading, just doesn't work as in doesn't open. It's not like I have a bad phone. But maybe instagram is for rich kids now. A app that only works on the latest 500euro phone. I try to use instagram as a business. But it's nearly useless if the algorithm is for reels and I can't upload simple reels.",1
"Like many others, I cannot load any newer photos to post. It only shows old photos I've already posted. If I go the round about way to find them, it doesn't let me do more than 1 at a time. Fix this issue!",1
This App used to be my favourite but it's full of bugs now. I have been trying to post a reel for days. Followed all the advice of clearing cache/ restarting etc... still posting it upside down. The time wasted is so annoying. Instagram please go back to being useable again.,1
"My app keeps showing a black screen even when I try to access any other feature,then tells me an unexpected error has occurred. This is highly disappointing since I've tried to contact the support team but to no avail!",1
"earlier i tried to find my photos I've took from Instagram but can't find anything, i wondered what happened and tried finding the album since I never did anything nor delete anything in my photos, if i do so i would find it in my recent deleted photos but no, it just magically dissapeared and now i can't access or find it anymore, all the photos, videos, memories, gone in an instant. Man i hope you guys can fix whatever happened if this is the apps problem please fix it",1
Search Algorithm is worse. Always show too many uncomfortable video when I click on search icon. Please either remove videos/reels suggestions from the search or improve search Algorithm. I try to click not interest in most of the reels but that type of reels or account still showing when I click on search icon.,1
What the hell is going on. I am trying to open Instagram but it is not opening. When I open it all in sudden a white screen appears and Instagram closes and I am not able to view any posts and reels that were saved by me and I am not able to use the app.,1
"its not the app but the ads for #chinning that i absolutely hate. There is a deep hatred for that specific ad. i hate the face of the model, as well as her demeanor, a glimpse of that ad drives me insane. and i would do anything to never see that specific ad ever again....",1
"Used to be great but now it randomly refuses to open for days at a time, delete, reinstall, ok for a while then repeat. Not to mention the algorithm changes and forced content...just isn't worth the trouble anymore.",1
"The app hasn't worked for 2 days, when I click on the app it just loads a white screen. I have deleted, reinstalled and turned my phone on and off so many times...Still won't work. So annoying.",1
WORST APP EVER DON'T DOWNLOAD it was fine for 2 or 3 weeks than it stopped working everytime I open instragram there would be a big blank page saying message status failed I tried reinstalling changing accounts and then after a month or so I found out the problem they said that my account has been deactivated and they won't tell me the reason why I don't upload any thing I did not do any bad comment and yet they just deactivated my account,1
"The app is not working properly, its loading for long time, my profile is not showing. I did restart my phone many times but the problem is still the same.

"I've been hacked. The hacker has enabled 2 factor authentication. I managed to change the password so the hacker can't log into it. At the moment I have the password, the email, the phone number, but I can't pass 2 FA. I am also the owner of the Facebook page linked to the Instagram account, even though they have the same content posted. So disappointed Instagram team doesn't want to help me recover my account back. And there is no contact email to whom I could send all the proofs I have. üòûüòû",1
My reel button isn't working. Numerous messages sent under help. Received no acknowledgment or any message back. So sad that a huge company like this can't solve this issue. Numerous people having same problem. Still having a problem with my other account with reels. Don't know what's happening,1
Cannot save songs videos as it saves without audio then have to download it from a different website. What is the whole point of coming on Instagram? Moreover only once it will post 30 sec video then it keeps breaking into 15 sec which doesn't make sense...,1
"App not working at all after reinstalling, which was the recommended action with all videos always freezing. Now only getting a blank white screen, can't get on the app at all. Have tried all the possible troubleshooting.",1
"Well, I thought it was just me but seems others have the same issue, Black page that goes nowhere. No access to my account. I've tried uninstalling, clearing cache etc but nope, just black screen of death. What a shame!",1
"Also having the issue of not being able to access my full gallery. Have to get to my photos in a weird round about way, and even then, I can't post multiple or videos. I've not posted anything for awhile because of it. Hopefully leaving a review will catch someone's attention so it'll get fixed.",1
"Instagram algorithm sucks. Music is never available in my region. Updates makes bugs even worse. Seriously, do something abt the algo. Buggy as heck and keeps glitching. We should be able to pin more than 3 comments and there is a need for edit comment option.",1
Every time I open my Instagram it just loads so in able for me to use it I have to uninstall then download then uninstall then download ( because if I exit it goes back to being just a white loading screen that's why I have to uninstall then install again and again) it's very frustrating. I hope you guys can fix this issue.,1
Can't even logon after repeated attempts -- minor security snafu's on their part are wasting my time and preventing me from seeing my kid's sport pictures from school. Can't leave it installed either -- keep getting annoying unwanted notification that they are evaluating me and cannot control notification except delete app. What a mess!,1
Unusable at the moment. It's not linking my photos properly so I can't choose the photos I want because they dot show up. I can access them in a round about way but only one at a time. App is basically u unusable like this.,1
"An app primarily made for photo sharing, which has divulged so much that it's doing everything except making photo sharing easy. What's with not supporting multiple full scale wide angle photos in the same post. Facebook/Meta has ruined it.",1
"Really frustrated, when I try to post a single photo it comes out fine but when I try to post multiple the photos become pixalated and the colours are distorted? Tried putting in a bug report but I can't find an option to do so.",1
"it's been a few days i already add captions before upload my post, but when it uploaded, the captions didn't appear in my post, then I edit it to add captions again, but it doesn't work like at all, Instagram just tell me if they're error and ask me to try again, then I tried like many times still not working, can you fix it?????",1
i can't get into my other 2 accounts - the app says that they basically don't exist when i LITERALLY FOLLOW BOTH OF 2 ACCOUNTS that i am currently trying to log in to. they are very much obviously active and they do exist. i cannot even reset the password because ‚Äúthe password you entered does not seem to fit an account.‚Äù PLEASE FIX THIS BUG.,1
"So I'm an artist/designer on Instagram and I've got a following for which I have to post more often nowadays because of the algorithm, my experience was totally fine before I came across this new ""White screen"" error! I don't have access to any of my accounts anymore and all I've got now is basically nothing!! Dear developers we don't want the new 9:16 feed or any other new feature added, we just want a pleasant experience with no bugs which is now hard to imagine when it comes to Instagram.",1
Completely unusable since the update. Can't access my camera album through the app and can't share pics to the app from my camera album. Literally no point in having this app anymore as I can't access any photos to post. Worst update you've ever rolled out. Hope it gets sorted soon.,1
This app was good but from few days I'm not able to see all the photos and videos that were being shared on dm. And also the post and reels shared. Just few recently shared loads and even they are mixed up. This bug is now irritating a lot. I thought this update must have fixed this bug but it's still the same.,1
"Hi team, facing new issue from morning, unable to add the songs for reels. When typing in search column for the song automatically complete insta is closing. Shutdown... Kindly check the bug error and fix it. Thanks...",1
I dread posting anymore cause once I finally have my photos edited and the caption ready it either says it can't post or the app shuts down completely and I lose my post. It's been happening for months now. It takes me 3-4 try's to get my photos uploaded without the app crashing,1
"This app is horrible on my Chromebook. Will not expand to include more than a tiny percentage of my screen, stays like a tiny tablet screen (so you can't see anything; posts are cut into tiny slivers). Horrible. Meta, you can do better.",1
"Bring Instagram back. I'm sick of all these unsolicited reels from people I don't follow, nor do I want to ever see. I want to see the photos of my friends, people I follow, artists showcasing their hardwork through their camera lenses. Not some useless creatures pretending to dance in front of the phone. Instagram is not tiktok. Stop trying to make it be.",1
Not pulling photos from my gallery. Only pulling photos I've already posted on Instagram. Just started happening this week. I'd like to be able to post new photos. I've tried everything to get it back to normal and nothing is working.,1
"Keeps crashing. I actually love IG, it's my favorite app but lately whenever I open it the app crashes right away. Don't know why because my friends aren't experiencing this. Also the guidelines are horrible, they will give you a warning or hide your comment if you use certain words.",1
App hasn't worked for over a month now. When I open Instagram the logo shows up for a second and then goes to a black screen and never opens. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling it a few times a day. Using the awful web version currently. - Google Pixel 6,1
Shame this app is become more and more like other social platforms instead of sticking to photography. The focus om video is also extremely apparent due to the many bugs in the app while trying to post photo's. Also getting sick of seeing content I have zero interest in from people or companies I don't follow.,1
I am unable to add songs in my normal post it's only available in stories and reel....I have updated the app also but didn't work. So I Uninstalled and later reinstalled them and now reaction feature in direct message is also gone...... it's the worst app I have experienced till date.,1
"After logging out yesterday, I cannot open the app already. I've tried uninstalling and re-installing again, tried to switch from wifi to mobile and restarting my phone several times. When I open the app, it's just a blank screen. I tried to open my account from another phone then it's working. So there is a problem with the app in my android phone. What should I do?",1
"With the latest update I cant even use the app anymore and the browser version is terrible to use. Edit: it got better but now it started crashing all the time. Edit: Instagram has gotten bold with the ads, probably 95% of the time I open the app the first post is an ad. So over Instagram.",1
"I honestly would love to rate more than just a star, but i am having some troubles using Instagram. Like ‚Äî when i try to open the app and login, it just shows a white screen, it doesn't even lets me login. I tried to uninstall it, clear the data but nothing happened. It works fine on my dad or my mom's phone. But it's unfortunately not working on my device. I would be really glad if you guys could help to know why this is happening, and how can I use it again.",1
You must make the app compatible with folding phones it's just so bad to use the app on aspect ratio for normal phones and when you make it on full screen it's cutting down from the content so just please support the folding phones then we can use it longer and better üòÄ i hope you read my review and make action.,1
It was a good app. But now after update it is worst. The new update about post videos are shared as reel sucks . This is a very bad idea . We guys want our videoas post not as a reel. Fix this ur make it choise that rather user want to post a video or a reel . Thank you,1
"Please help!! I own a iQOO Z3 and I have not been able to open Instagram for the past five days. Every time I open the app, it shows a blank screen and refuses to budge from there. I tried everything including uninstalling & reinstalling the app, updating the app, clear data, even tried installing an older version but nothing works! Please fix this issue immediately.",1
"Instagram is just getting on my brain. App crashes without any valid reason. Before pointing on my device malfunction, I am using redmi note 11s and i think it's capable of handling this app. About the services , I don't know where does those otp reaches, and on top of that loging in the account shows some unknown error. The services is quite unsatisfactory for me, and i am not being able to recover my account, why, just why?",1
"Well, where shall I start? It blocks my account every few weeks, it's from Facebook, it asks for my phone number, I cannot hide who I follow from people who should mind their own business, I get an error message or block when I follow many people in a short time, I can often not see the stickers and images I sent to someone earlier, the 'following' number is wrong, it crashes now and then etc. etc. :-(",1
"Why is it that the app is not giving you any option to send the authentication code or the back up code to your phone? I even tried my email, and still nothing! Yes! I checked the spam and junk! So I had asked for additional help from the support team and they send me a code that I have to take a picture with and they did not accept it! They actually sent me 3different codes to do it with and they still not accepting it! I followed everything they asked for!!! SUPPORT TEAM SUCKS!!! FIX THIS!!!",1
"Was great, now it won't even open. Been waiting 10+ minutes and just a blank screen. Maybe if they spent less time and money pushing ads and actually worked on thier app it would work. Too bad they can't even create an app that will open on a Samsung galaxy s10+.",1
"I once uninstalled this app due to shortage of storage. But after that when I reinstalled it, it didn't open rather it is showing some black screen. Really disappointed with this. If anything can be done please suggest.",1
"Instagram is a mess. Can't login AT ALL via web browser on my PC, and can't access business insights via the app. When I try, just keeps telling me to login to Facebook, and then doesn't let me. Beyond frustrating. This needs to be fixed!",1
"Awful updates. No longer in control of content or accounts to follow, and worse, it's more full of ads than ever. I'm going to take a backup of all my historical content then delete everything and install it. What a shame, used to be my social platform of choice, now I can't wait to leave it.",1
Initially it was working properly but suddenly issues appeared every time I open it a blank screen appears I wanted to add an account thus I logged out and now after opening it a blank screen always. No window for username and password appears. I uninstalled and installed it so many times but no progress as there is no internet issue it's only app's problem. Kindly fix this issue pleaseüôè,1
"I no more believe in technology... All thanks to u Instagram. Recently there was a glitch in Instagram on 22sept 2022 and after the glitch got resolved by ur team, all my reels which were present in my draft has been vanished. There was almost 600 + reels. üòîüòîI am very very unhappy. I'll never trust technology again - Someone did mistake and others got punished,its not fair Instagram. Kindly, give me back all my reels in the draft.",1
It's impossible to delete an ad post. Mostly every single scroll is to another ad. They constantly push nsfw content to me when I requested not to. Their reels show up more than actual creators. They refuse to assist me with any problems. I would never recommend this app to anyone. Actively avoid using this app.,1
I've had this app for awhile now not had any problems with it till now. It doesn't want to work properly even when I have a Wi-Fi connection it says that I have no connection to the internet. If I delete it then go to re-install it on my phone it says it needs a update every say like half hour it's just doing my headin atm makes me wanna delete it permanently from my phone,1
The app keeps crashing and stopping all the since the second-to-last update. The latest one made it better but then it came back. For some reason I still can't answer directly to other messages but everyone else can. :(,1
"Pictures posting is bad.. app in general is not better than fb. To add now, all of a sudden instagram deleted my accound without explanation or any email notification. And there is no one I can contact for assistance. Since there is no person who is actually working there..",1
For 2 weeks all I have is a white screen. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and installed the update. What the heck guys!? Frustrated 2 weeks down and not a single response. As a digital marketer not being able to use Instagram is an absolute hindrance to my work and my clients! What will it take to get assistance?,1
"I also have the bug where instagram only displays a blank white screen. I haven't been able to use the app in over a month. Reinstalled multiple times, cleared the cache, constantly checking for updates, and nothing has fixed the problem. Meta is the worst tech company.",1
"I can only ""like"" messages now (as of yesterday) not choose my reaction and in order to record a voice memo I have to hold the button instead of just pressing it. Way to take away some of your best functions.",1
"Like most software, they pushed out a redesign a while ago and ruined everything. It's a terrible user experience. It's embarrassing that the best way to fix your app is to just undue all your terrible ideas. The more you touch it the worse it gets.",1
Worst app in case of features.. Most of the mentioned features crash or doesn't work in different phones and different android versions.. Released without proper testing. Recent example is collaboration of reels.. Unable to accept reels collaboration from new android phones,1
Everytime I open the app it show a white screen and say couldn't refresh the feed..but my internet connection is perfectly working for all other apps..and when I open my account with Google..I can use it properly..but it has limitations so I want to use it in app..please fix this problem...terrible!!!,1
"While watching reels, the video gets paused after 1 or 2 sec of playing and I've to reopen the reel to watch the same. And this problem persisits with every reel or video. The visual gets paused after 1 or 2 seconds of playing.",1
If only there has been an option to give negative rating Instagram it sucks Not able to search any songs for the Past couple of months now it just keeps on searching firstly i thought it's network issue but then I switched to wifi mobile data hotspot but the music won't apper whenever I want to post a story with choice of my music it's absolutely pathetic.,1
"What the hell is wrong with this app !!

Every time I want to use the app it just show me a blank white screen ,.. I really don't know how to figure this out Can you help me",1
"I reinstalled this app and it seems like I've installed an older version of Instagram, because there's no option to reply to messages, no option to react to messages, everything is in the same place from back In the 2018 versions, I don't know if this is a reinstallation bug but PLEASE fix this",1
"Endless ads everywhere. Oh, and the forking reels for imbeciles. Can't turn off sound on stories after recent updates. What an utter stupidity. And interface buttons change their place when switch accounts or restart app. Developers seems to be using heavy drugs",1
Hi Instagram team Until last two days back my account was running perfectly fine. But don't know what's the issue now I can't see any story nor message neither any posts. I'm logging in and it's just showing blank page with only profile and my posts. I'm frustrated with this problem again and again even after reporting. I request you to please solve ASAP. As I have very important work on Instagram requesting again. I'm totally disappointed,1
"The message is not sent on time, only 'sending' is written. After some attempts, the message is sent, then there is the same problem in 'unsend'. Find solutions to these difficulties quickly.",1
"Garbage app. Everything goes through extreme far left censorship, and the functionality is pathetic for such a big company. Crashes every day, won't refresh, wigs out and doesn't show the like buttons or comments, randomly scrolls to back to the top when I'm trying to scroll down, etc.",1
Thanks for deactivating my account without any notice whatsoever. Yes I don't use it / login to it as often / daily as most people do but at least have some notifications if you are going to permanently deactivate someone account. And yes I have tried to request a review but it got auto rejected as it has gone past the 30 days or gone past your review. Again no notification to the legitimate email attached to the account so I was never been notified the impending deactivation is coming.,1
"A lot of the videos and images are really great, but there's been a glitch where none of my reels have any sound except obnoxious static. This has not been addressed despite my 3 different reports on 3 different videos",1
"HELP. I can't see my feed, messages, comments, stories NOTHING. I'm still getting notifications, but I can't like or comment, either. New stories & attempts at messaging disappear. Would really appreciate a STABLE app rather than all these changes users don't want.",1
"After the recent update whenever i get a new message the app sends me notification of all the messages i have already seen and it keeps Doing that sometimes, just randomly send me all the notifications of the message i have already seen . please fix this , it's really annoying!",1
"Everything glitches, no one has fixed My business account which has been restricted for 2 years now! As a business I need to be able to run adds. I want to give you money for adds! Also now won't post to my Facebook. I also can't accept collaborations. It's a complete mess.",1
Instagram app is not opening. If I open the app it is showing black background. It is not working. I have posted the issue to instagram help center but no actions has been taken. Too disappointed with Instagram. Try to fix the bug as soon as possible.,1
"PLEASE FIX THE FOLLOWING ISSUES ‚ö†Ô∏è 1. Please fix the view story share option. It shows the story from start. Only show the story that my post is shared. 2.

The blank space at the bottom, it shows empty space at bottom when its used with full screen mode. 4. üÜï Followers count glitch( its stuck its not changing)",1
"This app was really good but It's afew months now that lots of bugs appeared and they are really really annoying. Messages don't work, sent post links don't work, there is no reply in msgs, story views need lots of refresh to show and lots of other bugs. What are you doing in there exactly if not fixing issues?",1
"Insta app is doing wrost day by day. When it is in dark mode it automatically get light & dark rest all blank, which I used to reset to dark mode again and again. Ads on insta are so much that it appears after every single story, reels and post.",1
Cannot post new photos and only gives me an option for photos posted in the past. Had to go around the settings to only try and post 1 photo because it won't allow me to post multiple in that setting. Super frustrating and makes me want to delete app.,1
Absolute worthless experience since I updated the app recently. Messages are not visible in chats although I am getting notifications for it. They aren't deleted by the sender as I can see them after 5-6 hours. Reported this 3times but still remains an issue. Pathetic service.,1
"This apl gets more bugs with the passing of the time.. When I receive a message, I can only see it from the notification bar and when I open the app the message doesn't exist and I have to open it and close it again and again. Please fix it..",1
It has been few days we are unable to upload any kind of picture since the last update. I have uninstalled the app and installed it again with no results. I have a business page and it's frustrating me. It's blocking my work.,1

"Worst app. I've blocked reels of a certain content 50 times but it is the ONLY content I see on my reels. I do not interact with any of that content but it keeps showing up no matter how much I say I'm not interested. I will not use the Recommended tab anymore. Also tags are so filled with spam and art thieves I cannot find content I could like. The bookmark folders are also so broken and very difficult to use. If I could give zero points, I would.",1
"Very bad update! It changed my website link to old website, songs not found (NOT EVEN THE POPULAR SONGS!) I recently switched to a small business account from creator, now I can't add songs! Then why add it in the first place? üò° Instead of adding lots of useless features, try fixing the hundreds of millions of bots, spammers, and options!",1
"Doesnt load much now, cant send messages most of the time. UPDATE 9/18/22 the app is still bugging, nothing loads, nothing sends on time, half the time i cant even see pics ive sent as it just shows a blacked out spot, this is ridiculous what happened to this app? I wish i couls give it 0 stars as its been 3 months and still the same issues",1
User Interface Terrible. Trying to do anything with this app is horrible because things are always being moved around. Makes me want to throw my phone at the wall all the time trying to find things because everything on the internet is outdated by the time another update comes out,1
"Ive been on here since 2015, and it's nothing like it use to be. This app is an absolute dumpster fire now and is trying to be three different other apps at the same time. It's overrun by ads, you barely see anything from people you actually follow, and it's not about fun photos and edits anymore, it's like the Great Value version of TikTok. They recently added an option to subscribe to your followers, and they make you pay to do this. Please just stay off this app, it's not worth it anymore.",1
"there's been so many bugs with the new update. it won't load any of my saved posts. it says ""couldn't load posts. last updated 1 day ago"" and then 2 days, 3 days, etc.. it's frustrating and I just want to see posts I've saved to send to friends later. please this has to be fixed",1
My Instagram isn't opening. When i open it all i can see is a white screen. I tried clearing cache and data but it doesn't work. Even after restarting my phone it isn't working. I hope you guys fix it as soon as possible. Thanks,1
No technical support my account has been broken 9 days. I am unable to follow any accounts. I have checked status of account. No breaches clean. I've cleared data and cache I've deleted the app and reinstalled it. Nothing works. I've reported this issue at least 40 times with no response from anyone at instagram.,1
"There is a kind of bug in the app. When I play any reel the video sticks sometime and the audio continues to play. I replay the reel for 10 to 15 times, only then the video continues to play. I am really irritated with it",1
"09/15/22, This app is still unusable! Constantly being told ""Couldn't refresh feed"". Slowly or never loads anything. I've tried leaving beta channel, clearing cache, uninstalled, and reinstalled. Same. It's been like this for about 8 weeks. Please fix!",1
For a social media platform that suppose to mate up to Facebook it does a terrible job of it. Won't post to platform automatically most times. I have to unistall and reinstall way more then anyone dhould have to just to keep both accounts connected. Just terrible for a billion dollar company. Update: its getting worse!!!,1
"What is this app anymore? Everything is videos! The algorithm is trash! It's a Tik-Tok wannabe. As a photographer who uses Instagram to share my work, connect with other photographers, and collaborate with others, I am extremely disappointed in how Instagram is presenting itself. Could we at least get some photo/ video moderation? Time for me to find a new social network. üëç If you're looking to push people away, you're doing a fantastic job. *round of applause* - Download Vero Instead!",1
"please fix the app and bring the old Instagram Where we could save reels and posts through story There's also a bug or some issue, when i save the photos I clicked from Instagram it doesn't save it just keeps showing ""processing.."" or it doesn't load at all But from my other account it works perfectly fine Why is it that?? I want to save it from my main account, PLEASE KINDLY FIX THIS ISSUE OR IM DONE WITH INSTA",1
"Why'd you guys get rid of the camera/collage making feature after you take a photo? Where you can take another picture and overlay it over the original. That was my favorite feature, I used it all the time, and now it's just gone? What reason? What was the incentive to remove features people like? You guys haven't removed any bots or hackers, yet you remove functional features? Very disappointed.",1
The app was working until yesterday and today every time I open the app all I can see is my profile picture everything's black screen and it says it can't connect and I can't refresh anything or search anything the app is like down or something it's really weird I've already tried installing and reinstalling logging out and logging back in but it's not working.,1
App won't fix itself. Constantly keeps crashing on me. My phone has updated software and has plenty of storage. I never had an issue untill recently. I prefer to use IG over other apps. Now I don't think I will.,1
"Very bad üëé update stories get blured, reels get blured sometimes very slow working , as I have reported some issues and bugs did not get response in back , I can't swipe my messages or even can't react to a particular messages, did not get a quick and fast response by Instagram so I had to post my problems in reviews otherwise overall its a good public platform....",1
My Instagram is not working from last 1 month.whenever I open the app the black screen ia appeared I don't know what happened here.but this problem is can't be tolerated any more . For resolution I reinstall the app many times and clean or reboot my phone but the problem is not solved yet and I have to tell that this problem sucks please resolve the problem as soon as possible...no doubt the app is good but the problem is big and irritating so give attention to this problem...!!,1
It has stopped showing my favourite things to scroll in the reel section. It has become generalized search rather than my preference. This has happened in the past two days i hope this glitch is repaired. Other than that too there are some issues.,1
"I have been using my account since 2013. It got ""temporarily locked"" and there is no solution that is functional on their help&support. I have friends texting me regularly on that account. Email and their Instagram page does not get you any response. Will probably stop to use it at all, since they still have all of my content, but I cannot access it. Also I somehow can post to my locked account but cannot access it?",1
"Very, very bad! I am so disappointed! All I get is an endless white screen where I suppose to login. Of course, I have tried LITERALLY EVERYTHING and still not working. And it seems no one bothers from Instagram help team to actually help. .",1
"I was trying to make an account, I do it and I haven't even LOGGED in to the app yet and immediately suspended. No profile picture, a casual username of a formula 1 driver and suspended for no reason. I try denying it and it doesn't send rtext ,essages or emails until over 30 minutes later. Pathetic! I log in on another drive and fails every time. Maybe it would be better if it didn't crash 24/7 or disallow people from logging in. I am on a Samsung.",1
"I haven't been able to add up-to-date music in over a year. I can only add Instagram ""default songs"" to my stories or reels. I've updated my Instagram app, I've deleted it and reinstalled it and still nothing!",1
Copy of Tiktok app now. So basicly only garbage. Art and good content (photos) is not being showed anymore. Also when opening the app it show something you may find interesting. But he sort auto refreshes again to the top. So it it forcing you to scroll.,1
I can no longer post a one minute story (instead it reverts back to the obnoxious old 15 seconds for each story). That's truly annoying because i am not notified about the abrubt change (really out of sudden happening). Please fix this issue immediately!,1
"I uninstalled Instagram for some personal reasons. Now after installing it again, I am not able to use it. Whenever I open the app, it just displays a black screen. I've uninstalled and installed the app many times, clear all Instagram cache, and everything. Nothing seems to work. Please help me to use my Instagram.",1
"Takes forever to send messages sometimes. It's super inconsistent. Sometimes shows older posts upon loading, but refreshes immediately, happens too often, I see a post that interests me, and boom, instant refresh, gets annoying. Addition for 22/09/22 insta keeps crashing",1
"Support from Instagram is sh*te. Just because I haven't logged in for a while the Instagram thinks my password has been compromised and is trying to force me to change . It hasnt been compromised and would be a massive pain in the backside to change it. Of course I cant do anything about it cos I can actually send an email to them, utter cr*p!!!",1
"THE EXPERIENCE IS TERRIBLE!!! Instagram is such an important app to me, but when I installed this app right after removing my other Instagram mod Honista, everything changed. Now I can't even login Instagram bcos there's a blank screen and it didnt redirect me to the login page. Somehow, my tablet don't have this issue, and still can login into my account normally. I dont know whether it is my phone's problem, but please fix it! üòíüòë",1
The screen is removed automatically...so improve ur policy Nd the followers are gradually decreasing n when someone sends me request it is not adding up in followers list and in the video call it's showing only black black... while Nd it's showing some community restrict and itzz not showing the active status and last seen on the people and the Instagram is getting automatically off.The previous messages are not showing.... it's a humble rqst to change instagram fix ur bug immediately !!!,1
"This app was really good tbh, but now from the past 3-4 days whenever I follow someone a Pop-Up, pops up saying ""We limit how often you can do certain things on Instagram, like following people."" Even though I haven't followed that many people, like this thing is so freaking annoying, just fix it.",1
Instagram. You're a god damn photo sharing app. People go to you to share photos because not everyone likes to make or knows how to make videos. You've been a go-to photo sharing app for years. Don't make this change. It's a huge mistake. You'll loose most of the app's audience and force them to other places like Tumblr or Twitter. Stick to what the people want from you. Don't change the way your app is.,1
"Why the glitches? Every time I try to pick an audio for my reels, it crashes/closes and my drafts are all GONE! Where did they even go?? This app has become ridiculously frustrating to try and use. Update: Almost a month later, still can't use the app",1
This app has become completely useless since around May. The timeline is a complete mess now. I've lost all my views and likes I used to have. They keep trying to be tik tok when they never will be. Half of my friends accounts have been hacked in the last 6 months. And the final nail in the coffin was banning Andrew Tate the top G. I'm deleting this useless app.,1
I always love using insta in uploading my photos but its been almost a year since I started to struggle posting photos. Whenever I try to upload a photos some are blanks and can't even choose the rights photo to post since its not even visible...already deleted the app and reinstalled it but still didn't work. Like pls fixed this issue?,1
"Lost my feed and now its full of pictures of nature and aesthetic photos. I tried refreshing the page multiple times - didn't work, tried logging out and back in - didn't work, uninstall and reinstall the app - didn't work.",1
Instagram you really need to get it together. I can't even request or follow people and every time i try it gives me an error and unfollows the people i request. Its annoying and needs to be fixed asap. I am still having problems with this app. It keeps glitching and shuts down. It keeps giving me errors. At this point i do not even want to use the app anymore.,1
"CONSTANTLY CRASHES! In all the months I've had this app on my phone it has never ran properly. Even on my old phone. It sometimes won't open at all. My storage is no where near full, cache is cleared no issues on this end. Bloody useless.",1
"Can't get to the posts of my friends because of all the suggested and sponsored posts. (No matter how often I have actively chosen not to see a suggested post.) At the moment it looks like this: One post of someone I have subscribed to, one sponsored post, one post of someone I have subscribed to, one suggested post. It goes on like this. 50% of the posts are pushed into my feed and are of no interest to me whatsoever. Instagram is utter rubbish. Good bye.",1
App is not opening... I have unlimited data but the app is taking too much time to start. After starting i am facing the same problem while loading images and videos. I believe that there is bug problem in Instagram. Either you Solve my problem within a short period of time or i will uninstall it forever.,1
"Currently unable to post reels. Tried several times using all the different methods to post one. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app, logged in and out so many times to try and get this to work and still nothing. Reported an issue using that feature on the app and no response from devs. If it wasn't the main source of communication between me and my friends I'd have binned this app off ages ago",1
Been experiencing an issue where app crashes and refuses to open again. I've uninstalled and reinstalled probably 6 or 7 times in the past 2 days. It always fixes the problem but it seems to be happening more and more frequently,1
"Got a new phone and cannot login to my account on it. Cannot reset my password. None of the resources to resolve this work; they all say there's an error and cannot be processed. I keep getting a response that there is no account found with my acct name or email, which is false. My account is just fine. I'm still logged into it on my old phone. So.... app is bricked for new devices?",1
"After i updated the app, it goes blank on the screen and i can't see feed or comments. Before i updated the app there is no problem and it function properly. I try to reinstalling the app, restarting my phone but it does nothing. It's useless. Please fix this problem",1
It has been one and a half month that my Instagram app is not working. Whenever I am opening the app a white screen appears and that's it. It is persistent. Have tried with install uninstall.. Checking phone memory everything that I could do.. Please look into this matter ASAP.,1
Very bad as my 1)app is crashing and crashing every time I am trying to but it is crashing (2)when I made my first account in that i can't react i can't reply like other people do but when I made my second account it can do everything. Instagram do you have this feature that in first account we will not give we will give this feature in second and third account üò°.please fix it (3) when I try to give stories it takes minimum 3 minutes to load please fix that thing it's very boring.,1
I already uninstalled and install it but nothing changed its still loading and it's all black. I can't even use it to be honest. It's always like that everytime I install it again. Then when I uninstalled it all my pictures from Instagram vanished in my gallery. It used to be a good app. Sadly there's nothing to see there because it's all black and always loading. I even try to report it but still nothing happens and sometimes it's just loading so I end up not reporting it.,1
"I logged out of my account and now it shows only blank screen. I cleared cache, deleted it and reinstalled it many times but nothing seems to work. It's been a week since this happened and I'm still not able to use it. Only a blank screen pops up whenever I open this application",1
"Trying to use the app for business. Won't allow create a new account (blank screen) re started phone, no luck. Uninstalled/reinstalled the app and updated everything. now I can't even get it to open a page let alone log in again. Useless. Just a blank screen.",1
"Instagram used to be great, but now it trying really hard to be something it's not(tiktok). And it creates an environment where the people that built the platform(photographers) are pushed to the back.",1
Pointless having an app solely based on posting images and videos when it doesn't show any of your images or videos in your gallery when trying to create a new post. Been an issue for me for the past few days now. And I have uninstalled and reinstalled.,1
"I would give zero star if I could. Absolutely useless, not able to upload any video (even not a 3 seconds one). Error message coming up about internet connection (200 Mbps upload speed), than stays on the screen until I delete the app and reinstall it.",1
"I've got so many issues whule accessing my 2 accounts, the account automatically links with an unknown number, even If I've changed the number it again show the same number, I had been trying to get the confirmation code after I changed the number that is linked, but it show that the code has sent to that number that I don't even know. This really sucks, I've been trying that from hours but still the same issue, I think I've lost access to my account and it has so many bugs and glitches.",1
"I take back everything nice i ever said about this app! I have been trying to log into my account for hours now and it is showing error in that. This is the 2nd time it happened... I'm seriously fed up of this app. If I can log in next time, I'm CLOSING MY ACCOUNT and going to done with this once and for all.üëé",1
"Hello Dear Instagram Team I cant even open the app anymore. Everytime I open the app, it just shows a black screen now. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling a few times, but it didn't work. Same thing happens to reels, only difference is that if I scroll down and back up Please Solve This Issu",1
"From the last couple of days the app doesn't work properly. Everything is black and blurred until i clear the data. It goes better in the first run agter it, but from the second run onwards again its black, blurred and not working.",1
To much glitch. I can't add the audio to my story. No indian audio is available. Only english songs are available due to some glitch or anything else. I have done report as well but there is no response. I have been facing this issue since a month.,1
"Edir2: still no change,same old spam accounts and scam advertisments. Edit: Cant go one day without seeing scam ads No privacy at all. No response from instagram about this. All followers will se your activity and no way to change it. Aside from that theres lots of bugs which makes it unusable at times, used different phones, same kinds of problems. Sent feedback but nothing changes.",1
"Recently my instagram is not working well everytime. Its not crashing but the feed is stuck up from loading! Wifi is stable but my instagram feed is stuck from loading! I tried to force stop or clear data to settings but its not working! I tried to uninstall and install again, it works at first but if you quit browsing the app and when you try to open it again, its stucks again from the loading feed! The app is updated to the latest but idk what is wrong!",1
"Everytime i click on a link advertising something I'm interested in the page won't load and if I exit it and come back Instagram fails . It turns white and says "" unable to refresh "" . App won't give me notifications and videos keep playing after I've already closed the app .",1
"Reels are uploaded upside down. This sucks, i tried reinstalling, clearing cache, clearing data. Have done everything possible. This is worse. In world so focused on reels it's frustrating to see this not working out.",1
"I really don't like all the new updates. Moving around the functions of the notifs and post, even the search bar, my tags don't even work so people don't see my posts anymore. It's become a hub of stolen tiktok reposts instead of original work from content creators. This used to be my favorite social media app, but it's quickly losing its original appeal: the simplicity of photo sharing. Not to mention my news feed, I dont see posts from people I follow anymore. Everything is just a mess now. :(",1
"Deleting this trash until you fix it. Cannot select certain folders now under post for multiple photos. Only shows select few folders and when I find the right folder, it won't let me select more than one photo that way. Ps your algorithm sucks.",1
"Its been almost 2 weeks since ive tried using instagram and whenever i run the app it just shows a blank screen, I've tried troubleshooting it but i think the app's the one's at fault. it doesn't redirect me to the login page whenever i run the app. when i open it it just shows the logo and then it goes blank.",1
I can't make use of filters or effects when I want to post a reels and my message section doesn't have the multi coloured chat and I can't reply to a message bye swiping the specific message I want to reply to the right it made me to delete the app for more than 10 times but it's still the same. Please what is wrong?,1
So frustrated with this app. I can't even get into it anymore it's just a blank screen. I see several other users are having the same problem. Are you going to fix it IG? This is ridiculous. I've been waiting for over a month to see if it would get fixed. Uninstalling and reinstalling several times with the same issue.,1
Annoying glitches - app keeps crashing when posting photos. The restriction on only able to post 10 images sucks. The fact one can't edit the size of the images separately prior to posting needs to get fixed. Please do something about it.,1
"Can no longer access messages, even after uninstalling and reinstalling the app. It crashes and doesn't even tell me why. Now the app is useless to me since I only used it to keep contact with some friends and not for the dumb content anyway. Please find the time to investigate and fix this.",1
"it has been few days this app cant function, it still goes blank everytime i open the app. i've restarted, reinstalled many times, clear the cache and data, but it still show the blank page. i've sent an email for asking a help, but there's no reply.",1
"Making a new post has now become the most annoying procedure. I can only access photos I've already posted on Instagram unless I choose 'other', in which case I can only choose one photo. Horrible! Wondering if Meta plans to make posting content so tedious that the only content on the platform is advertising? Is it so hard to make a platform that allows us to easily and seamlessly publish content? Isn't that its entire point for existing?",1
I've been using Instagram for literally 10 years. When it first came out it was a lovely app to see pictures of your friends. Now you scroll and 2/3s of all posts on your feed are from accounts you don't follow. I find myself spending less and less time on the app because of all of these things that their algorithm pushes to my feed that I never asked for.,1
"I hate that you can post/share multiple photos if it's a story, but not to your wall only one. Even then it won't show me my current photos only ones from before the last update. Sucks if you are trying to use social media to boust your small business. It's changed too much to be useful. Time to find a new app.",1
The app that doesn't have any customer support.. what's the use of using this app without a particular help desk.. how many times that i have tried to report but there is page which shows the instructions but not right page to complaint about the issue.. i am waiting to connect with help desk to raise my issue... But that won't happen I think..,1
"I am not able to post multiple photos in one instagram post on my feed .Photos gets blurry and fuzzy .Tried multiple times posting it ,however problem remains the same.Not sure how this can be solved .Pathetic update of app,contains many bugs. It's a shame !",1
"Since the past 3 days ive been having issues with instagram which renders it completely useless. Everytime i get on the app it immediately shuts down itself. I cant answer my dms, cant post stories, cant scroll through feed, cant view stories cant do anything in a nutshell. It keeps closing itself no matter what i did. I tried everything and nothing works",1
"Instagram was fine throughout the years I've used it until now. No matter how much I restart my phone, when I open Instagram nothing loads and dms won't send. I know it's not my wifi or data as all of my other apps work. I just tried unstalling and re-installing bur now it won't install again.",1
"There is a major problem in the music section. Whenever I am searching any of the songs but I'm not able to find anyone of it. Lack of songs , only lo-fi , frustrated. You need to fix this bug ASAP.",1
"Uploading photos has always been a hassle on Instagram and it just seems to be getting more difficult. I can't even upload posts or videos to my feed anymore, on my ipad. It is only allowing me to upload photos. Plus the algorithms make it impossible to get any reach. Without paying that is.",1
Absolutely worthless. After reinstalling the app opens in a white screen and I've searched and tried every possible solution available. Instagram doesn't reply on my bug report and it seems I'm not the only one with the issue.,1
"*UPDATE. It's pretty much become unusable. I don't see anything from friends anymore. Over half of the posts are from famous people or people I don't know. If they show one ad I report or say is too repetitive, they just show something similar. It's all ads. Ads ads ads. I've got a lot of great photos there but I'm almost at the point of no return, absolutely unbearable. They don't care about their users.. They need to start listening because everyone has their breaking point.",1
"I am a photographer and i was happy with this app few years ago until they decided to be the new tik tok. I am so disappointed that original photo content is not important on Instagram any more... Especially after they have added reels.. I have faced significant dip in reach and exposure. I hope to see Instagram, Instagram again",1
"1. Still no ""reply to message"" functionality on Android. 2. Algorithm failing to keep the feed relevant. 3. Ads prioritised over other content. 4. App is stuck when uploading a story. 5. Failure to sort the story viewers by any kind of logic. 6. Web version unable to update in real time, lacks basic features. 7. Facebook is dragging another good app into the social media graveyard with it.",1
"From the time I have installed the app in this handset it is giving problem to the phone. After using or while using the app, the phone gets hang for substantial time. After that it reboot itself. Otherwise also phone goes for reboot at any time specially when on the call. If the app is not opened for say 5 days, the phone has no problem during this period. Problem starts on using this app.",1
"Instagram really, really, REALLY needs to add an editing option after you've posted a comment. I've forgotten how many times I've posted a comment, reread it and realised that I forgot to add a word or misspelt something and instead of holding down the comment to edit it, I've had to delete it and rewrite it. This isn't 2010, it's 2022, Instagram is the only Social Media app that doesn't have this option. Update your app",1
I been experiencing a problem with my camera. It's showing everything very thin if we hold the camera vertically and vice versa when it holds horizontally. I swear. It's not about my phone camera. This keep happening only in ig camera. Please fix the bugs or whatever that is,1
"It's getting worse and worse...it used to show the number of views which seemed ok for business pages but now likes are shown on its feed. I'm getting disappointed with it completely and prefer to try another app...also, reel is a terrible idea...",1
"There are lots of bugs in instagram app for android. When we share any photos directly from gallery to instagram stories, It shows errors. Sometimes its start and sometimes not.. it starts hanging. When we switch to another account it says you cant switch while uploading even i am not uploading anything. Fix the errors please.",1
"I used to love Instagram, it was a great way to share my love of crafting with other like minded people. With various updates I see fewer of the posts I want to see, more advertising and reels. And now I can't post anymore, it's not linking with my Google photos account so I can't choose photos to post. Sadly I'm being forced to give up on Instagram.",1
"Broken app. No longer allows me to post more than one photo at a time from my phone's gallery. Will only allow me to post multiple, if I take the photos while IN the app. Huge downgrade. If this isn't fixed I will switch to another place to post my art, and delete my Instagram account.",1
"I cannot use this app at all. The moment I click on it, I have 3 seconds before it kicks me out. There are times where I'm lucky enough to be in the app for longer than 3 seconds, but the moment I swipe to see my messages, it then kicks me out. Its so frustrating.",1
"The most recent update is awful. I cannot upload photos or videos as a post, reel or story - which is the whole point of Instagram! Without the ability to do that the app it literally pointless.",1
"ever since june 29th, every time i open the app all i see is a black screen. i've uninstalled and reinstalled the app, cleared the cache data, and restarted my phone more times that i can count, and nothing has worked. please fix this.",1
"Good UI but it's mostly advertisements. This was once a good platform but 95% of what I see when I open the app is poorly focused advertising. This is no longer a medium for art and photography, it's shameless money farming. It's hardly even social media.",1
"Everything was going good but suddenly I am not able to share any status . I even try with my other insta profile but it doesn't work , I also try uninstalling and reinstalling but it doesn't work. And now I am not able to post anything or share anything with my Instagram friends. Please do something or, if you are not able to fix my problem then please tell me the reason why I am not able share any status, post, reels????",1
"Fundamental change in the wrong direction. This used to be a fun way to see what you're friends were doing, see their photos and who you wanted to see. Plus you'd see posts in the order they were posted. Now my friends don't see my posts and i don't see theirs because my feed is cluttered with recommended reels, posts, an unbelievable amount of ads, and accounts that I don't care about. Easily the worst social media app now.",1
"When ever I change ids, it glitches, I get white bars, disappearing text, it happens in dark mode. I have to restart the app to run properly again. It also happens when I switch app and come back to ig. Crashes instantly when opened. Your app sucks.",1
"It is showing person online even though the person is not online. Also, it shows person online even though perosn stops using app and sudden it shows last seen like active 10 minutes ago. Thats means within seconds persons status changes from active to last seen 10 minutes ago. Need to remove this glitch.",1
"I still do not have the ""add yours"" sticker after it has been removed for some reason, even though i tried everything, from reinstalling and updating to the most recent version of the app to switching to professional account, and still no sticker. Meanwhile, my secondary account, @the_mwma has it, but i barely use it. I have to draw the sticker because i want to use it, but i can't acces it. I do not understand why was it removed from the account",1
"I would rather give negative stars... Because from the last month this app isn't opening at all.. Whenever I try to open it ,it shows a blank white screen... I tried every single way to sort it out but nothing happened.. I uninstalled it but nothing changed ,the same blank white screen get opened everytime..",1
"Very buggy, crashes alot, being solicited by not real people, when submitting reports there are no responses so there is no way to appeal when algorithms go wrong, the damned app is still crashing which is most frustrating. Bring back OG Instagram that was more user friendly, and not trying to be tiktok.",1
"Well my former issue (not being able to post a picture) was resolved by uninstalling and reinstalling the app. However, now it won't let me log in to my second account. The account that is linked to my Facebook profile? No problem. The other one? Nah. Get it together, Meta. The account exists; I can even log into it on my phone's browser!",1
"Recently I'm facing issue about draft reels. once I make a reel then I Dave that reel into draft. But whenever I opened the insta app that saved reel is no more available,the draft folder disappeared automatically. i don't know why it's happening. So please fix bug asap.",1
"Since Instagram decided to be TikTok wannabe I hate it. I hate using it, it's completely not user friendly, I never see posts from accounts I follow, posts are not in order, there's more ads and sponsored posts than actual stuff I wish to appear on my wall. On top of that forcing to make reels, which in most cases are shallow entertainment. IG lost the quality and being photographer there feels oddly painful. If there was alternative app I would already swap to it. Disappointment of an app.",1
"After this last update, I can post anything from my photos! Come on people, get it together! Don't bother contacting customer support for anything as they don't care. I've had 1 account hacked and they never did anything. No phone number to call, only email. That account that got hacked, gone forever! This is just bad all over!",1
"Whenever I'm tapping on reels section, I'm getting this error ""We're sorry, but something went wrong. Please try again."" on black screen. I did clear cache of the app, restart my phone and even uninstall/reinstall the app. There is no solution.",1
"For the past few months, this app has become unusable. It takes forever to refreshand to load the page. Slow all around. You're constantly having to close the app. Un-installing the app also doesn't work.",1
Worst app. It is testing my patience level. I can' t search my fav songs while I add my story. All time i see no results found. What the hell it is. So many bugs are there. So difficult to use this app. Each day any one of the problem will occur.,1
For anyone dealing with IG loading a solid black/white screen when you go to log in!! I finally just figured something out after a month of issues so maybe it will help you too. Go to log in on browser and reset your password (even If you dont need to) and then after you reset it your email should automatically open the instagram app with your account!! Only downside is you can only be logged into one account but it beats the browser version! Hope this helps someone!! üíñ,1
"I don't know what's happened but I can no longer post multiple photos if I want to choose new photos. Instead I have to choose photos I have already put on Instagram? Or choose a singular photo from a different album instead of all my options coming up as soon as I open the ""new post"" like it used to. Absolutely rubbish",1
"Horrible. It used to be good but it's horrible now. I can't even open my direct messages. People send me messages but I only see them in notifications. Instead of doing all unnecessary things, fix these bugs. It's so disappointing",1
"Worst app developers ... every while should happen the white screen bug ... never been an update without bugs and problems... unfortunately am using it, soon will stop using it forever ... its been 10 days with the white screen bug without any fixing ... my work and business ruined so i will never trust using this application anymore and will start build up my account on different platform.",1

Already updated, uninstalled and reinstall many times. Please help!!",1
It used to be a good app but recently when i tap on the app it can't load the app and all i see is a black screen so i can't log in and use the app but if you log into your acount you won't face this problem again. So please fix this bug.,1

"Glitches are horrible and security is awful. They never maintenance anything properly. Just locked me out. I reported the issue they refused to respond or fix the glitch. I think its hacked but they won't look into it. Brief update : I was able to log in but now stories won't work. Face the fact. It's a bad app. At least it's free and now, rather than actually improving the site or how it works they literally force you to use an buggy unsafe app.",1
"Loading gets longer despite the good connection. Older history was useless, post repeating; forever not able to scroll back to where you have last seen, annoying advertisement and profiles that you never follow is getting more which leads to news feed keep refreshing and the posts unfinish scrolled, post repeating when loads older post, post that you have never seen falls to older post. Instagram is stepping back.",1
"Like many people mention, when I go to post Instagram only allows me to see a portion of my gallery. This is a new issue that has happened since the recent update. I refuse to post 10 photos from 1 night in 10 different posts!",1
"My instagramnloads very slow, can't refresh like ""last updated 10 hours ago"". My internet is good can watch 1080p video WITHOUT buffering, phone is pretty fine too. Update 20 September 2022; - Same issue like my previous reviews. Instagram feed won't refresh. I can't even go into the setting, it gives me blank screen only.",1
"It won't even let me upload photos and I get constant errors Update August 2022: it's even worse now. Eventually I got photos uploading, but nowa anything stored in my drafts is deleted once Instagram is restarted. It constantly still gives errors and crashes too. Honestly just sucks which is surprising, you would expect better from a big company like Meta",1
"Dear Instagram I like the longer version of the IG story video thing, but the down side of that is everytime that i do a IG story video in the middle/the end of recording a video it keeps bugging or not smooth flowing video kinda thing?! if that makes sense?!, So i like the 4 clip video IG story thing better than this latest update soooo PLEASE INSTAGRAM FIX THESE PROBLEMS üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª.",1
"Absolutely no support for hacked accounts. Absolutely ridiculous. IF I ever get my account back I'm deleting it. All of my information, photos, contacts, etc. have been stolen from me. And there is NO customer service available to help. The ""help"" center is a joke and the steps to recover accounts on there do not work. Extremely disappointing. Now I know why everyone is leaving this app.",1
"I want to tell you all that...my all friends have the right swipe options to the dms, can't react to dms\ reels , can't like others story and I have reported the complaint more than 2 times but you all are not working on it.... I know that you will fix...it....but please help... it's not easy to chat on Instagram without the right swipe feature.... please solve as soon as possible",1
"Whatever you've done Insta, I can't connect and upload photos to Facebook via Instagram connection, I can't see my entire gallery to even post, I have to go the long way round. I really don't know what you've done, but it's a bug.",1
"My account is incorrectly suspended for violating terms which I have not done. When I try to appeal it, I recieve an ""Error"" message which makes me unable to submit the appeal. There is no contact email for help, so I have now lost all my photos for no reason and there is no way to contact Instagram. This has been almost 3 months now aswell and the same error message of ""Sorry, there is a problem with this request, we are working on getting it fixed"".",1
App will not load!!! App is freezing and I can't even scroll or see my messages in my DM. I have turned my phone on and off so many times to reset the app and it still freezes. The last 2 days the app has been useless!!!,1
It is the worst update that have ever occured. It looks like we are only allowed to send the reels and other images to the facebook friends and we have to search for our friends on a new dropdown menu and above all we cannot share it to only a single person which made the update worse,1
So many bugs I can't even count them all. The most glaring one is a reel straight up not working. The audio plays but sometimes the video just freezes and refuses to play even when you restart the reel.,1
I has been using Instagram for quit long. But all of sudden it stop working. I had tried to many thing resolve this problem but it won't solve. also I had download this app more then 10 time but still this app is showing black screen. Please solve this problem as soon as possible,1
App isn't working. It's been 2 days with a blank white screen. I've uninstalled & reinstalled and it's still not working. I have an Samsung phone so I'm not sure if this issue only applies to that or if iPhone users are having the same problem.,1
"hey instagram, what's happening on my instagram? Every time I click on multiple photos from the gallery and then next to the editing, the photo that appears in the picture is blurd with pink instead of the original photo that appears from the gallery, why is that? does it come out too blurry with pink? please fix this instagram now!!!! I've been mad for a while now!!!",1
"Instagram decides what others see not you. The algorithms down grade the reach of still images meaning only a small number of your followers will see your posts. You can get audience reach if you post a moving image that an algorithm decides is interesting, funny - make a idiot of yourself on camera, that'll do it. Bug ridden. Regular crashes. Tiktok dumping ground. Failing at everything, under the marketing guise of an improved user experience.",1
"It's a pretty good app, very useful and fairly easy to use. The problems start when I get my notifs late, I can't see full reply threads and it will often refuses to send my messages. Fix it, they are continuously piling up",1
"I continue to see Instagram pages that I have blocked. No matter how much I've reported them or hit ""Not Interested"". I've complained. I've tried to email. I've sent notification after notification. No change. I just deleted this app yesterday for 24 hours to see if maybe that would help‚Äîit did NOT. MAYBE if the devs actually looked at all the one star reviews, they'd see how much this app sucks now. With every minor ""improvement"" made, A THOUSAND bugs/issues are added too.",1
"Endless ads and irrelevant content. Make the app less and less enjoyable. It's no longer your friends who are prioritized but rather an algorithm and sponsors. I'm just tired of having stuff forcefully presented to me. It's like you're constantly being harassed by things you don't care about it wasn't to see. I just want it to be about my friends, that's it.",1
"This app use to be great, however your heavy sensor ship has gotten out of hand, we as Americans have freedom of speech, you are triggered by certain topics but others you turn a blinds eye to. In addition some of your features don't work properly. Only keep to keep in contact with topics around the world & certain friends/family!",1
"Received a notification that my account had a temporary ban on it due to content that I've posted... bear in mind I've only posted my profile pic and couple other pictures that were anything but explicit. Tried to ""appeal the decision"" which I did and now I have not been able to access my account for several days now, tried every account recovery option and that was completely useless. All I want is an easy solution to this issue, apparently that's too much to ask for.",1
"It's so unreliable. I can't post anything, constantly crashing, freezing, just closes by itself. Not to mention that I keep getting notifications for password reset request when I haven't!!! Just keeps getting worse.",1
"I can't open the app!! whenever I open it, it just shows the logo and then goes black. I did everything I could but it's still the same. Please I am so frustrated to the point that I dreamed that I can open the app already, I thought it was real so I woke up and checked the app, but it's still the same. Please fix this as soon as possible, I badly want to story and post pictures huhu :(",1
"All adds get reported as spam or inappropriate, until majority of adds get cut back. The huge amount of them are all spam. Please Cut back on the large amount of adds",1
"When I got on Instagram today, my account has been suspended for unknown reasons and now I am stuck in a loading screen. My account was perfectly fine yesterday and it says I have been suspended even though I didn't do anything to go against community guidelines!!",1
Hello what happened to your apps ?. I can't open my story ig. I can't watched my previous stories. I refresh the feed many time. It's same. Please fix this,1
"Cannot login after the last update, always says ""Cannot complete request"" yesterday it was fine before the update and now can't even login after re-indtalling the app",1
"Trending reel audios appear as a general audio on my account! I tired reinstalling and logging in again, but same problem appears time and again. None of the trending reels show on my account. This is hampering my account's reach and engagement. No matter my hardwork and efforts, Instagram just drags me down the spiral. Instagram is getting toxic by the day!",1
"Bad, idk if its my phone problem but I've try with all my other phone I still got the same problem, everytime I watch video on my reels its always get lag. Honestly ruin my experience",1
"It really makes me crazy, I just keep it because of lovely friends I Have otherwise I would deleted forever.... It constantly messages me ,your app stopped, I can barely post stories...",1
"Why is my account being susoended? It was working fine all the while. After update to latest version, then my account being suspended without any reason. Pls help to fix the issue.",1
"Why do you guys keep making unnecessary changes bruh, and, why are my reels all weird, they used to be so fun, but now it's just things i don't even care about, liking anything or ""not interested"" nothing works to let the algorithm know i want the other stuff",1
Dear instagram team; I have an issue with chatting massages swipe massage reply is not working in my Instagram account pls cheak and reslove this issue as soon as possible üò£ üòñ and most lagging and bug files in this app üôÉ Thank-you.,1
"Huge issues after the last update. Freezes instantly, app doesnt respond and jams the whole phone!",1
"Basically stopped working a long time ago. Pictures upload pixelated, videos won't load at all, can only see up to date feed when connected to WiFi even if I have full signal. Occasionally I think I've managed to make a post but Instagram shuts down just as I'm about to finish, often crashing my phone.",1
Often difficult to upload photos/videos. Various problems that I've reported and never get an answer or a fix.,1
I am try to watch reel and sms but it's buffering too much and all other site working freely except Instagram. It's happening after this is update.,1
"Way too many ads. And selecting ""not relevant"" or ""not appropriate"" doesnt actually get rid of the ads. Also now requesting a copy of official photo ID, supposedly to verify age, but feels incredibly invasive when Meta already has access to your entire life. And now they have deleted all my data and information. If I try to log on the app crashes",1
It's shows that I received a text from someone but didn't show it after I touch on the chat icon please fix the bugs,1
"The app isn't working with the new actualization, notes aren't appearing and I reported but nothing at all, the worst experience.",1
Too many adverts and sponsored posts - almost every other post is an advert. The sponsored post are terrible - I don't want to see some loser with irrelevant content who's paid for sponsored post showing up on my feed.,1
"I JUST CAN'T LOGIN üò§ it keeps saying that the username I've entered doesn't seem to be available when it actually is, I'm able to login from chrome but i can't with this app",1
"This app disabled 2 of my accounts for no reason. Absolutely 0. They said they ""suspended"" my main account but then completely deletes it for saying ""wuss"". They suspended another account for a ""cuss"" word without any warning. And after 3 days its suspended still. They don't care about their customers and ignore them when they need help.",1
"All of a sudden, I can't open other user's LINKTREE links. The app takes me to Instagram feed, and then my chats are all white and non-responsive. I tried uninstalling and then reinstalled the app and that didn't work. Anyone else have this issue? Issue resolved. Making Reels is fun, fyi.",1
"""audio unavailable"" is what I see on every single post. This used to be a video app, but more or less it's now just a ""motion picture app"" because there is absolutely no sound at all. Every single song, every single sound ever captured apparently is too offensive for the Instagram app to play to your sensitive ears. Let's all go to TikTok and leave this Zuckerberg mess for good.",1
I was suffering quite a lot of bugs so I decided to Uninstall and reinstall and now I cannot reply to specific messages and also the latest and earliest option for followers doesn't work so instagram has just gotten worser,1
"Cancel the last ""tiktok wannabe"" update please. I'm constantly unistalling and installing the previous version because for some magic reason it keeps updating to that annoying 235 version! And yes, I've checked and the auto update is off! Update: Still 1 star - The app keeps getting worse and worse. Lots of updates, zero changes. Now I can't even use location tags properly on my stories. The transparent tag gets all messed up.. how's that even possible?",1
I dont receive any login code. I can try again and again from 4 days but no message can receive. Other message can receive easily but intagram login message not receive please fix this error for me.. . pakistann country....using ufone network simcard,1
Drafts no longer save even after hitting save. I've reported the bug but no one has done anything to fix it,1
"I've had so many issues, mainly with Reels. You have to use Reels because ""that's what the algorithm favors"" but it never works. They take SO LONG to make, the text it always mixed up, and for the last 3 days they've all been posting upside down?? I don't know what's going on but there are so many issues with it its ridiculous to use.",1
"Used to be really good. They're making it very unfriendly to use in attempt to compete with tick tock. Barely ever see my friends posts in the feed. As soon as there is an alternative platform, which has the functionality of the old instagram, I will be moving to it.",1
I recently updated this app after it is not working this application messages and updated reels not working my internet is good please fix it..,1
"Shadow banned for no reason , 3k followers and 100-200 reach max !! Unfortunately there's no real competitor , can't wait to switch if I find anything better.",1
"It's such an embarrassment to see instagram turning to a disgusting app. The filter doesn't work, My dms aren't working when new message arrives to me, just fix it please! And while i watch some people story it just close. It starts to stuck and be black kind of things. And now it just stoped working. Literally sttoped when i open it its all black. I uninstalled and installed it again but no change. Its just lame. I updated it and still not working.",1
This app was good at first but now they ask me to change my password and when I try changing they said it's incorrect whilst I have a screenshot of my password and it's correct so why won't it work,1
You failed to recover my hacked account and when I tried to call your customer service they said they couldn't help me due to shortage of costumer service.and then when I make a new account you randomly disable it. Terrible app and trash customer service.,1
I can't receive any confirmation code from Instagram. That's why i don't use it properly. My account has been suspends and block then i need the the confirmation code,1
"When posting multiple pictures in a post, all posts except first one get cropped inspite of setting it in wide frame.",1
"It is a good app to use but unfortunately the promised 1 minute length of the story video has been reverting back again to 15 seconds. And also please fix the bug of the story where sometimes it stucked in the past few hours... For example, it should be passing 24 hrs already, but still it shows there 12 hrs ago.",1
Stories are now completely broken and they immediately switch off of any story that doesn't have audio or video attached.... Unless they're ads. Convenient! Thanks for literally force feeding me ads!,1
Everytime I go on the app it freezes and my phone will do a hard reset it used to be a great app but not now I'm thinking of deleting it and not to use it again,1
"Reels is the most garbage thing out there. I posted the same video on multiple platforms which was staged. Instagram is the only app that took it down. Restore it. I know the only reason u guys removed it because it hit 2.7 million views and you don't want to pay me for that. *****new update my account was removed for no apparent reason after the update i just lost 13.1k followers, brand deal messages, And memories i had of my deceased father that i have archived.*****",1
"i'm actually really annoyed with this app. it constantly crashes and i was not able to refresh the feed, so i deleted and reinstalled it..and it was same after reinstalling and the new update, it annoys me even more. it is flooded with reels and videos and i can't see pictures or any posts. its really annoying...",1
App not functioning. Can't log in my instagram account. It always says error log in even though I input the correct username and password.,1
I have reinstall it...now it's buffering and hanging within 2 seconds of opening the application. Very disappointed,1
Not able to acess notes feature after the latest update. Waste app. Issue not resolved even after reporting.,1
What's going on Instagram! Again my videos are buffering and it's all updated.. I'm seeing things from 3 days ago instead of current stuff.. really sucks!,1
"the messaging side of Instagram is trash! I don't even know how to explain it, but it gets really messed up. some options disappear and you have to restart the app to fix it. it's really bad, been happening for years without a fix!",1
Ads have taken over. You now open the app to an ad and see one every time you scroll. Not gonna waste my time.,1
"The app has a lot of bugs, the features doesn't transfer properly to multiple account users. I've been waiting for almost two years for the messenger feature to work on my newer alternative accounts, yet it has never appeared. The app also likes to strike/shadowban users for the littlest of things. I'm honestly dissatisfied and a bit disappointed",1
Don't know what is happening but when I open my Instagram my internet stops working... It's very irritating I am not able to open my Instagram since last 2 days.,1
My Instagram is not working properly! It showing repeating post again ! In my insta feed... Please fix it ! There are no response to queries or complaints !,1
"Team Instagram, The reels are not being played, when I open it to play it becomes a black screen. It's been 7 days since I have been facing this issue and complaining almost every day! I am not able to watch anything! I am using a Realme 8 and this problem has started since 7 days ago. Pls fix it asap. I have given a bad review about Instagram on Play Store and 0 rating, I will change it if you fix this issue at the earliest.",1
Please update and upgrade more because.. I find that Instagram at the moment are having so much glitch as for example my ig following is increasing without my knowing and it can't be reduced by unfollowing others.. Then it also have a problem to see others stories as it kept being swiftly turn to other ig story.. So that we can't watch it properly.,1
"This app uses languages from different countries. But why Bengali language was not used.üòíüòí This app is used by most people in Bangladesh And it is having difficulty using.If Bengali language was used, it would be easier for the people of this country to use it. So I hope in the future the app will come with the use of Bangla language.",1
"Disabled my account for ""violating community guidelines"" which I DID NOT. I followed the instructions they gave but still didn't solve or addressed the problem. No chat support or email support offered. I used to love IG but this experience made me want to regret using this app.",1
I can't log in my account anymore üòë changed my password but yet i can't log in! Tried by mail Mobile number and recovery code.. kindly look into it and i request to recover my account as soon as possible,1
My account got hacked and I've been locked out I tried using my cellphone number to unlock it but still since my Instagram is synced with my Facebook I have trouble will all social media accounts because they are synced and if one is hacked then all won't work thanks a lot Instagram for ruining my social life,1
Worst app ever...not letting me create my account...when I create my username and click on next nothing happens...also have reinstalled app multiple time but facing the same problem..,1
I've been sending reports for 4-5 days but there's still no response. My insta isn't working on wifi even tho my wifi is working fine all of my apps are working just fine on wifi except for Instagram. It's getting very annoying now as I'm not able to send messages or do anything on this app anymore and i spend most of my time in insta this is very disappointing,1
"I can't send message often , its just stuck on sending while using wifi and while on data too its happening sometimes.",1
"The app isn't working properly, taking too much time to load. Last two updates of Instagram isn't working properly on my phone.",1
I'm facing problem with old version as I have reinstalled so many times and reported my problem but no actions were taken due to which I'm facing problem to the peak. Please help me Instagram,1
"Bloody awful. Posting a reel is an utter nightmare. It distorts the pictures & videos, zooms in unnecessarily, limits saved songs to 20 even if you have more, it forces itself to use data while inactive& inserts an unwanted green lines on the videos and photos like there's a corrupt file. The security is shambles... hackers are getting away with it. GET IT TOGETHER INSTAGRAM?!!!!",1
"This app is getting worst in the further updates...used to love instagram once...but now,the app is a waste of time...too many bugs ...my pH is also getting stuck while we use this stupid app",1
"Sometimes when i look for my friends active now, it doesn't really active now and it says active now, i dunno why Instagram need to have bug. If don't have bug will die!!! üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°",1
"Pathetic App 1.Notification don't come on main screen,you will have to go in the app to check. 2. And now I am not able to send any messages it's failing again and again. 3. The memes which I am sending to my friends it's showing 2 times the same reel in the chat screen. 4. You keep on updating the app but still the problems remain same. 5. As of writing point 3 and 4 (while editing) one new update has came .",1
It's unbelievable how poorly optimized this app is uploading videos that were taken at 4k 60fps drop the quality to the point you can count the pixels Watching a video on the feed and scrolling down the slightest will glitch the video to its thumb nail but will continue to play the audio And clicking the video won't open the video after its glitched This app is falling behind so bad its becoming clear as to why TikTok has gained more support This app is out dated buggy and poorly supported. S22U,1
"After searching, the song is not coming, this problem is coming since one month, now when will this problem occur, please give me a solution for this problem.",1
"The hell is wrong with this application. It won't load, won't update feed. I am kinda very pissed with this app. Why so many bugs",1
"I can't access all my photos. The ones it is showing as ""photos"" are all Instagram photos I have already shared. I can go to ""other"" and eventually find them but I can only select one. If I say I am adding multiple photos then the ""other"" option completely disappears! Please fix.",1
"this used to be great but recently on my new pixel, it keeps freezing and stoping and is glitchy... keeps throwing me out...üôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅ",1
super frustrating! I make a post and it looks like it posted but my post disappears! it's been like this for 2 days! I do have 2 Instagram accounts and it's only happening to one of them! I've reported the problem now twice! Edited...the app won't even work on my phone. I've uninstalled and re-installed it and nothing,1
"Absolutely unusable. I, as a person who literally just came here to read comics, is insanely disappointed. I've created multiple accounts, and only one of them works, at least it worked until now. There's this weird glitch that prevents me from doing literally anything, it says ""couldn't refresh feed"" and then throws me onto a white screen with an error message on top.",1
"Not able to login Instagram. ""Unexpected error"" showing even after clearing cache and data .Also tried to login with Forgot password.That also not working.",1
the suggested posts are very annoying! I just want to see my friends posts and everytime I feel like I'm forced to see posts of people I don't care about! I don't like to check instegram as usual anymore.,1
"It's really disappointing the negative spiral Instagram has gone down since being acquired by fb/meta. In Instagram's prime I enjoyed the chronological order in which people's posts were displayed, that it wasn't overtaken by ads, and that it wasn't overly censored. It's also funny the timing that Instagram prompted me to rate it because it had just glitched out on me while I was trying to post multiple photos. I had to restart the app 5 separate times ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1
Like other users I can no longer access my recent photos to create a post with multiple photos. When posting videos the sound is out of sync with the vision. I used to use this app regularly but it's becoming unusable. Listen to users and fix it!,1
My Instagram activity (where I view and reply to comments) keeps auto-scrolling to the top. This has been happening for more than a year & pretty stressful as I have to scroll many times to reply comments. I loose many comments that I should have replied to. I've searched the internet for a solution but none. I'm also never able to see my ads insights on the app. It keeps saying there's an error & we're working on this. This has been happening for over 2years. I'm beginning to dislike the app,1
Something awful happens with Stories since last update - they're living their own life and constantly scrolling back and forth. Please fix it ASAP!,1
"For whatever reason, I cannot and have not been able to open the app at all in 4 days. When I try to open it, all I see is a white screen. I have done all of the troubleshooting methods like reinstalling and clearing cache. Nothing works and this sucks because I promote my business through instagram. Thanks a lot",1
My Instagram page just vanished. Showing 'user not found'. And I didn't violate any terms. I need my page @chrisiji.art restored please.,1
I'm still using instagram but there is a problem.It is not active and i think that would be internet connection.For a long time it is not active.Now I goona try to take photo by updating this one.Thanks.,1
"Not working properly,not refreshing,can't open any features since last 10 days , pathetic experience,i don't know what to do.",1
Someone stole my Instagram account don_hellsworth.34 a person with wessels in their Instagram ID. I have tried everything but no help from Instagram and I've posted on Facebook aswell and I'm getting no help whatsoever,1
"Used to be great. Now it sucks. On some accounts you only get very limited music choices and searching doesn't show up, and the songs that do show up are songs that most people don't even know or are from like before 2000. Please fix it.",1
"Not a safe app! Ignorance towards nudity content. The scammers with fake accounts lure men into their website for money. They post nudity into theirs stories, it has been reported numerous times and no action has been taken on behalf of Instagram.",1
"Opens to a blank screen. Same experience as many others lately. Tried to install, uninstall, clear cache, restart and troubleshoot with multiple suggestions. Still no fix. Meta, is there a plausible reason why this has continued? When will this be fixed? Incredibly disappointing.",1
This app is just becoming too bad day by day idk why it does not work smoothly at all if I want to share something then I can't share that by 1 time I have to try repeatedly to post that why? I don't like this app at all... 1 star is too much I guess geez,1
"Genuinely deleting it now ,can't go on my feed without people getting killed or porn showing up ,rlly need to get a grip of this app used to be decent, now just a disappointment.",1
"There are too many problems now a days . I can't use any type of location system in this app. Any I report too may time but nothing changes. Still same issue appears üòï. The old version is better than this I think so, that version not having this kind of problem but version having too much problems. And know a day it's draining to much data aslo and some useless features are in new update but ,the good features aren't working properly first fixed those issues then add something new.",1
"Experience getting worst .. sound save nhi horhe, option hi nhi show horhi.. worst.. so many bugs ,so many glitches.. filter not working. Sound doesn't get an save option.. Instagram getting worst day by day",1
I wish IG will go back to the old ways I hate the new set up I never see my followers can't post trim videos without it being made into a reel see the same exact pages every single day I never see any of my friends anymore IG has really change for the worst,1
"I have a black screen when I opening my Instagram app and it won't even let me login for a while now , for several days , maybe more than a week, I've had to use the website and it's not the same at all...many other people have the same issues, we've installed the new update today and still won't work , it's a black screen upon clicking the app and it stays that way.... Please fix this issues. Thanks .",1
I have problem with insagtam login. Every 2-3 days automatically logout and can't log in with Google save passwords. Plz fix it as soon as possible. Fanks,1
My version of Instagram is not the same as my friends Its like they have or receive an update and i don't. its not cool that we don't have the same version.,1
Terrible Android integration. Takes me about 30 minutes to figure out workarounds for bugs.,1
"I can't see ""see translation"" in my profile no more. I use another language such as Japanese and the people who speak that language can't translate my bio. Because that option isnt there!!",1
"My sons account has been deleted he's not done anything wrong on it as I look at it, even though he's 17, 3 times now he's set up a new account only within days its been deleted followed all instructions every time noone has ever got back to us with advise or to reinstate it, we are both disgusted with customer service and disappointed with the app, If anyone has any advice to stop the account from being deleted after a new one is set up could you please advise me Thanks",1
"Too many ads, and you have to fight constantly with the app for tailored results if you're a heterodox person. Many scammers message you directly for phishing. update: they added cartoon avatars. Meta is a truly incompetent company.",1
"i actually cannot add another accs, it keeps sayin that the username isn't exist or error when the username and the password is totally rightt. tysm.",1
App connected to share all stories to other apps and now wont let me disconnect. Says I need to update but using the latest update already. Infuriating!,1
Won't let me adjust photos in a post if you have more than one to adjust! Ridiculous for a photo app!!,1
"1. The following-follower mechanic causes conflicts among people. 2. Requires too much internet bandwidth to load media. 3. The UI is just confusing, the UI for posting a story is just unusable. *Update* It doesn't even work anymore(lol ü§£), it displays white blank screen on startup and stays like that forever.",1
New update has so many bugs. apps keeps crashing. I can't stay for 20 seconds in app!,1
"I'm seriously getting irritated by this app. I don't get any notifications for messages, and 80% of the time I don't even get the message! It's takes like 3 days to recieve anything!!! This is seriously problematic for a business owner who works with clients I have a business account and it keeps setting my account back to a regular one and I have to re activate the business settings. Fix your app Instagram!!!",1
It should have a separate search button without recommendations below it & there should be option to disable reels if someone want to.,1
Instagram is showing that I have no account with my username. But I do have it. It's not logging me in neither the app nor on any browser. Look into this matter please.,1
Are you kidding with this new update? Shopping tab? Who goes to instagram to shop? Most of the ads are scams anyway! Also swapping it with a conveniently placed (and used more often) activity button to the top of the screen?! Dumb. Now videos can't be viewed in landscape anymore either?!,1
"i'm actually really annoyed with this app from yesterday. it constantly crashes and i was not able to refresh the feed, i dont even see anything it just get black and loading thats it so i deleted and reinstalled it 3times and the new update, it annoys me even more. it is flooded with reels and videos and i can't see pictures or any posts. its really annoying....also bring back the old layout, it used to be user friendly which the new one is not.pathetic experience from yesterday ü§¨ü§¨",1
IG is becoming unusable. It's only tik tok reels and ads. I don't see any of my friends' content and they don't see my content. The only thing that would save the platform is bringing back the chronological timeline.,1
"I haven't been able to do anything on the app for about a month, I accidentally logged out of my account and instead of a log in screen it's only showing a black screen and I'm not able to do anything. Yes I've tried restarting my phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, looking for updates on it and nothing seems to help",1
Am facing some issue in the app all the storys or pages are not getting refresh ... Please suggest .. There is no any update showing.. Bad experince,1
"1) Adding captions are trash. Looks fine while editing your clips but once posted your first sentence will stay on screen with the rest of the captions overlapping it. 2) Why, after spending time coming up with a witty caption with suitable hastags, does Instagram post the pic/video but decide to not post the caption you put time into?? 3) instagram, you're not TikTok, snapchat or any other social media platform. Return to what made you great in the first place and stop trying to copy others",1
"The most recent update change the UI for no reason. App is completely unstable, crashing every time opening DMs or looking at someone's profile. Had to clear my cache and storage for insta. Now I can't log in to my secondary account. They also removed the ability to react to DMs. The app is completely unstable and unusable right now",1
I post regular content but loosing my followers continuously. I have recieved so many bugs while login and also the reach of my page has drastically droped and now i am unable to login my account.,1
"This is the second time my account has been banned over nothing. It's the only form of communication I have with several people and it's my connection to the outside world. Give me my account back,this is ridiculous. I hadn't even been on all day and when I got on I just had a random suspension.",1
I don't know why they changed the app so much. I hate how many reels there are like what happened to Instagram having just photos. It's like the app lost its sense of uniqueness and is just becoming like tik tok and that makes me so mad. Also the fact that you can choose the size of your photo just takes away the Instagram feel *AGAIN*. Also why don't I have the option to block recommendations on my home page for 30 days anymore. Its so annoying. PLEASE get your act together and fix the app.,1
"Hey Instagram. Can you get rid all the bots? Its so annoying fr. Im afraid in the future, Instagram full of bots, not real people. If you listening this, thank you so much.",1
So many bugs sometimes reels stops and i Hear the double sounds of the same reel and i even didn't get the notes option in my id but all my friends are using it plz do something,1
After recent update. Not loading refreshing page is too slow. App not responding properly.. Why you not fixing the bug.. Everytime same issue..,1
My insta app not working properly it's buffering and reel not showing only buffering.üò† Please updated this app and fix these type of bugs...,1
"Posts and feeds doesn't load properly, search stops working and meanwhile the ads continues to work without problem.",1
Instagram sucks it's a place for all the sheep to meet together following trends and whatnot nobody or I should say very very few people are original most people around there are doing something because somebody else did it first.. and that's whack,1
Can't see how many people like a reel / video. Explore page is 90% irrelevant ads (despite clicking not interested) and videos take forever to send,1
Oh my... I can't create an account even from my PC. I just needed to contact someone who believes that this can be used to sell something. Worthless.,1
My Instagram account is correct and I'm using it for long years ago also .. but these app disabled my Instagram account... And I can't know what the reason was... My Instagram account is true not fake ..,1
It's not responding. Uninstalled and installed. It went back to an older version without any option to upgrade...,1
It's getting annoying I'm trying to plan my post ahead of time for my business and it keeps deleting my drafts! It's costing me time and money!,1
"I can't access my account and everytime I try logging in it only says ""Please wait for a few minutes then try again."" I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR DAYS AND STILL CAN'T LOG IN TO MY OLD AND OFFICIAL ACCOUNT. Can this app get any worst?",1
"Every day it stop getting refreshed I'm fed up with this app , I have to reinstall again and again. And sometimes reinstall also doesn't help.",1
"‚Ä¢add follow request even if the account is public ‚Ä¢add the option of selecting multiple accounts from our following list to be able to block/unfollow instead of going account by account ‚Ä¢add search bar to search through blocked accounts list ‚Ä¢community guidelines are absolutely useless,too much toxicity,bullying,slutshaming,defamation,nudity,going on but y'all don't do anything even when we report,yety'all censor the stupidest things. ‚Ä¢too much ads,bugs. ‚Ä¢too much kids allowed on this app.",1
"massive problems with the dm functions. things barely or never send,, pleease fix it since i have a long distance friend and it makes it super frustrating",1

Instagram is forcing me to turn on notifications with a popup that cannot be closed in another way than restarting the app.,1
I recently updated the app and it become worst . I can't get the option of music in story and reel option.,1
I am unable to use this app. It constantly showing so many errors and also keep on asking phone number and I added Everything still showing errors.,1

I just posted a photo with a music within two days they removed the music and they giving a caption that this song is not available.Then i reported the problem but i didn't get any response,1
"When I want to post a reel, it always freezes and closes itself, it's so annoying and stressful.",1
"can't disable certain notifications, this app feels like a malware if anything, having unwelcomed notifications pop up randomly.",1
My account is suspended for no reason and I don't know that my privacy is currently secure or not. This is so much careless thing and not a single message from Instagram side for consolation.,1
Since the new update it's impossible to colour the background of a shared post in my story. The drawing icon has disappeared completely and I don't understand why.,1
It's so glitchy it's unreal. Now I can't edit any snaps except the first one. It needs fixing.,1

"it won't even allow me to open the app. I can't access Instagram AT ALL on mobile, and it's a chore to use while on PC. terrible.",1
Awful. One of the single most restrictive apps on the market. Actively making the human experience worse. This app is cyberpunk dystopia in a single download.,1
I tried to re-install it on my phone and it just flat out refused to also some of the people i used to follow arent even on my account aneymore and i haven't un-followed the and they still haave the same account and the app.,1
I didn't liked the updated version because I am not able to save videos I am regretting now I liked the earlier version ...it had a saving optoin which directly saved the video in my gallery,1
"My account got hacked & deleted i didn't get an email no nothing it's just gone like that, username Amanjlit pls bring it back, there's no way for me to contact Instagram which makes it useless unlike sony or Microsoft for example",1

"If it wasn't because of my business, I wouldn't even think twice to quit Instagram. The moderators and support teams are so negligent to everything that's happened on this app. Reports on users breaching community guidelines? ""Whoops sorry we've received too many reports, so we can't do anything about it."" Reports on a missing feature despite having the latest version? Crickets! I HATE METAVERSE WITH EVERY LIVING CELL IN MY BODY FOR WHAT THEY DID TO INSTAGRAM.",1
"Unable to login from past 48 hours, login if it's happening then error coming we will review your info and get back in 24 hours but still no update... Worst app... No proper support center",1
The app used to function just fine but the last few updates are glitch galore with constant issues. Fix it.,1
"Shows you the same four posts and tells you that's it. Most posts are ads, doesn't show you posts of the people you follow. Really starting to feel like what's the point.",1

My Instagram account has been deactivated by Instagram. Even though I did not break a single community guideline. All my memories - lost. Very disheartening.,1
"I had White Screen for over a day. I fixed it by finally doing a factory reset on the phone (after backing up my files, with Instgram uninstalled). Uninstalling, reinstalling, updating, rebooting, clearing cache and data, joining/leaving beta group did not solve this problem. Only now after a full factory reset am I able to see the login page again and log in successfully. If this happened to me again I would: delete IG, backup my data, and try a factory reset.",1
"Just here recently my account was suspended but Instagram refuses to show me what caused the suspension! All they say is it's a violation. I don't post nonsense. Instagram made a mistake partnering with Facebook, as FB is too strict anyway, and their only card to play is kids could see it. News Flash: ""kids don't need to be on FB or IG anyway and if so why isn't there separate App Versions of both apps, one version for kids platform and one version for the adult platform?",1
"Every time I open the app, the first video disappear spontaneously and get replaced by another one.",1
Recently there is a bug that i can't open my followers and following list. Another bug is that I don't recive notifications for follow requests at all. I tried to unistall the app and download it again but it still didn't work. I have reported these issues more than once and nothing changed. It is re really disappointing.,1
They dont give us any option how to recover disabled account. I fill the form almost everyday and the same thing pop up tells that they can't review my form because of Covid-19? I do the same thing for past 3 month and they still can't review it.,1
"***** Still loads of bugs nine months on. Keep uninstalling and installing. Nobody gets back to you. Now not even installing. Rubbish !!! *** Not sure what has happened within last couple of days my account blacked out. Re-installed app at least six times, no joy ! Checked software up to date - it is ! Cleared cache etc etc. problem not solved. Any ideas anyone üôè",1
"Ads app. Too many ads, and you can't watch your feed without suggestion in it. Basically your feed is lesser then all ads and recommendation. I don't mind ads, but this way too many. And why do I have recommendation in my feed? When I used search I could watch it, but now I have two recommendations, for what? This app is getting worse and worse.",1
"Your last update of Instagram is so annoying , that 'note' feature is taking lot of space it sooo big i mean + i don't want to see it on my DMs page , i mean respectfully who this idea was for God sake üòë",1
How to contact instagram helpline ?? Nothing 2e can post . It just shows posting but nothing is uploading .. videos also Not open . updated version is totlly waste,1
"At first, things were alright. I could log in, post, and talk to my friends as normal. A few weeks ago, I couldn't log in to another account of mine without getting a blank screen. To see if it would fix, I logged out of all my accounts. Now, everytime I open the app, there's a blank screen. I've deleted and reinstalled, restarted my phone, and did everything thinkable to see if it would work‚Äî but nothing yet has worked. Fix this problem or I will encourage my friends to uninstall with me.",1

Been having a lot of issues lately with app keep having to uninstall and reinstall it just to see things and to have it work right for a few hours,1
Instagram is really a joke now. Can't schedule posts even on a professional account straight from instagram. It's buggy and glitches constantly. It's a joke.,1
"Instagram is controlling my free speech and suspends my account every time I say something that some entitled and inflated Ego finds offensive, while continually promoting offensive, discriminatory, and inappropriate content on the page. It looks like this platform has a problem with honesty and integrity and makes it very hard to interpret their community policy which favour only one type of demographic and one type of woke culture.",1
"Me and my friend are not able to see each other's account. If someone share his profile in chat, it is showing unable to find user.",1
"There is problem in my Instagram, i can't load stories, post, feeds , settings. I couldn't load anything. I receive messages but my message aren't sent to the recipients.

Why i can't get the Collaboration option. Very bad. I have sent the problem to you but no response. Totally unexpected. So kindly enable the Collaboration option to me,1
I don't see reels option. Why a user updates any app from play store just to get latest features but i lost the option which was already there. Please fix it,1
"Instagram keeeps freezing all the timr, extremely buggy, please add some fast internet fetching algorithms for better browsing on Instagram.",1

I do everything I'm supposed to do, post regularly, post reels, add hashtags, interact as much as I can with posts etc and still get bugger all interaction and when I look at the details of who's seen things my reels don't get seen by many people. It's not easy to make reels as an artist especially when you work full time. I don't want ads, I can't afford ads for account, I don't want half trailers I want a functioning app",1
"Very slow app, stories mostly load very slow or not even load properly even with high speed Wifi! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1

"Explore feed's messed up, keeps recommending indian reels and other stuff i'm not interested in. No matter how many times i click ""not interested"" they still show up.",1
Reel editing still can be buggy and the music selection still leaves some to be desired.,1
The android version of Instagram is always buggy. You can tell they do not care about the android operating system. Right now it crashes any time you try and load a story and it's been like that all day. Most other apps fix it within hours when it's something so catastrophic. Not Instagram.,1
"Why are the comments being displayed so randomly? Bring back chronological order, there was nothing wrong with chronological order so I don't know why you removed it..",1
Very bad experience they hacked my Instagram and took it with changing the email address and phone number and it wasn't protected by Instagram they only sent me email and i didn't check my emails that night i woke up morning with a surprise i couldn't login no matter what i tried,1

"For an app from one of the biggest social media companies in the world I'm appalled of the level of bugs on instagram on the google play store. the app is shockingly horrible. I hate using instagram on my Samsung, I wish I never made the switch from iPhone to Samsung.

"Terrible Reel System Holy smokes, it is IMPOSSIBLE to upload a normal 20 second reel on this app. I usually have to clear the cache, reset my phone or even reinstall it to get it to post. If I try using the text in the editing system, it usually comes out all wonky and wrong. It's just terrible to use.",1

"When I upload to my story, the text displays weird (it's glitchy or something, idk). It's been like this for a couple of weeks and it's annoying. It's also hard to see photos from accounts I actually follow. I'm constantly seeing photos and reels from accounts I don't follow on my feed.",1
I don't like that the gridlines are back when editing a photo and there's no way of turning them off. It's hard to tell the before and after when long pressing because the gridlines automatically show up. They're not helpful for everybody so it'd be nice to be able to DISABLE THEM,1
"I was really enjoying Instagram, being able to share upto 10 photos in each post. But after a bit if a break from the app I tried to share highlights from a recent walk and found that now I can't upload multiple images from my phone. This app has become useless!!!",1
"This app is complete trash, doo doo water, full of bugs and issues that are breaking the app. I can't believe a billion dollar company is struggling to actually make the user experience on android phones bearable, not good but at least make it WORK!! Adding features that no one asked for and not even the reply function which super helpful isn't rolled out globally after over 3 years of its release. Do your job, fix the app and make the app enjoyable again for the users.",1
"I love the app. Unfortunately recently I found it is impossible to use anymore. When I open the app it just shows a completely black screen. I have tried reinstalling it, restarting my phone. Nothing has worked to fix it get",1
"App will not recognize my phone to pull photos from. Instead, makes me navigate through apps/folders, rendering posting more than 1 photo impossible. Upon choosing a photo, the app inexplicably turns the photo sideways with no way of fixing. App has been hot garbage for the last week.",1
"The lack of proper support is exhausting. In case you are hacked or locked out of your account, there is no support whatsoever. Though you've been on the platform for as long as good 10 years. Been constantly trying to reach out for support, over a hundred requests and emails, yet no response whatsoever. Not even anything automated.",1
"I would have given 0 star if there was option for it. Instagram app isn‚Äôt working on so many devices for more than a month, the developers aren't responsing to the issue even after mailing about it sincerely. It is showing only a blank white page instead of the login page whenever we click on the official app & the developers aren‚Äôt even noticing it yet.",1
"It's not at all working...While opening app it's came like a black screen and there is no response. Tried all the way by clearing data and reinstalling...but it doesn't work. Instagram lite is working properly. Clear the issues properly, otherwise instagram will lose it users...",1
"Too many bugs. Idk if its just my account or everyone is having the same problem but the posts are unable to share. It takes so long saying ""sending"" meanwhile, I can't recieve messages or send any and then ultimately shows ""failed to send"". I've tried reinstalling the app several times.",1
This is ridiculous... Last time it had a 2 min glitch on evening on this September 2022 .. Don't know why my all drafted reels vanished... And I tried my best to recover those.. I was unable to get that.. and aslo mailed the authority and still there is no response... Can you please stop vanishing my reels from drafts.. it's the 2nd time I'm facing same issues.. and also update app to get my reels back.. and it's of no use.. Please get me back those... I recorded many memories on those..,1
They are trying to be like tik tok but are failing miserably. Unlike tik tok this app doesn't know how to recommend videos based on what I actually like and want to see instead I get dumb videos about construction or food. I get spammed with forgien content with terrible music. Using this app is just miserable now. Go back to how it was before when the suggested posts actually worked how they were supposed to.,1
"Sooooo many issues lately! Will create a reel and put in drafts. When I go to post later, it's upside down, all black or just frozen. Will put text on the reel and the text won't show up when posted. IG you are trying to hard to be tiktok and failing miserably at it!!!",1
"Its been more than two month and my screen is still blank. Did not expect this kind of thing from a huge company and for this long. Anyway, tried every possible thing but its still not working. Please fix it. Its high time. JUST FIX IT ALREADY! Your app is the worst!",1
"Instagram doesn't work sometimes. Believe me I tried everything. Clearing cache, restarting my phone, logging in and out, reinstalling the app, and nothing works. It works for sometime after reinstalling, but after 10 minutes it doesn't work again. Please fix.",1
"The reelsay the dumbest feature. Everytime I try to make one it usually takes several days as I can't be in the app editing the video forore than 30 seconds without it glitching, closing, or erasing the entire reel or duration settings. This happens literally everytime.",1
"There is some kind of bug.....I don't know whats happening whenever I try to send a video , open camera, send pictures, make a reel or just put a story by clicking pictures by intsa cam it shuts off....whole app is off . It's happening from last couple of days and I'm FRUSTRATED . Do something about it. And I uninstalled and reinstalled it and nothing is working....fix this bug its frustrating and waste of time",1
So many bugs. Wouldn't let me upload images so reistalled the app. Now when I try to login under my other account it's telling me my username doesn't exist. Even though I can login through my laptop. Also when clicking reset password an error message comes up to try again in a few minutes. But doesn't resolve itself. No response from instagram when reporting the issue.,1
"buggy mess that will never be fixed, ive been using this app for 7 years now and my account doesnt receive any of the new updates and has been slowly LOSING features to the point where i can no longer post recent pictures on my account. this issue has persisted over multiple devices, it is like you have personally taken the features from me. terrible awful app.",1
"Too many rules, too much inconsistency. Uploaded reels just cut off, if you can upload them at all. The bias toward portrait mode video is problematic. The entire platform is a mess and not well suited to business.",1
"Totally exhausted. Uninstalled and reinstalled many times, done whatever the troubleshooting i know. Instagram is not at all loading. When I open the app, it shows the first page and then when I scroll, no photos, videos visible even stories. Have been facing the issue from last 2 days. Need urgent fix",1
"Latest update is absolutely shocking. Didn't realise it was updated automatically on mine, and when I go to do a new post, I can only view instagram's media folders and post already posted items, anything new I have to go to ""other"" with no carousel option whatsoever, can only post 1 at a time. What a ridiculous update. Unless that's fixed might as well uninstall and post elsewhere.",1
"Instagram used to be the best app ever. But now, it's eventually becoming useless. It's trying to be tiktok when it shouldn't have. Everytime I post in my ig story and write something, it shows glitches of colors around the letter and words. I just end up deleting my ig story if that happens. Maybe I'll uninstall ig as well.",1
"Lost a couple of important story drafts because it kept glitching and would neither save them, send them or even let me open and see my own freaking drafts. Now, every time I open the app it crashes and won't let me stay more than a couple of seconds before doing so.",1
"this app is getting worse lol i encounter one problem after another. whenever i upload a story with text on it, the texts are always distorted amd glitchy. im genuinely concerned bc i have my settings set to high quality uploads. tried all possible troubleshooting i could think of but to no avail. it's ridiculous.",1
"I cannot access my Instagram account for days and weeks, password resets don't work, pages don't load, depsite reporting issues and sending screenshots of pages not loading and error pages constantly, no response or fixes offered by Instagram. There are other social platforms to advertise and share photos on so I am going there. 4 business running smoothly, now I can't even log in for months!!!! Fix it!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"I logged off from my Instagram account and now I am unable to log in. Whenever I am opening the app, it's just not showing me the log in page. Just a damned white screen. Tried everything from uninstalling to updating the app. Not sure how to resolve this. I tried loggin from Instagram lite and that was working but the interface is just weird.",1
"I used to enjoy Instagram, but now find it annoying. It's very difficult to reach people without paying for ads, and my feed is full of ads, videos I don't want to watch and stuff I'm not interested in. This app was much better when it was mostly about still images.",1
"The app doesn't work anymore, yesterday i logged out for some reasons but i couldn't log in again, once i open the app it shows me a black screen, i tried to reinstall it and reboot the device and clear the data and installing older versions but nothing has changed, i hope they fix this issue as soon as possible",1
The home feed now showing more content from accounts that you don't follow is very ANNOYING. The garbage popping up from these accounts is awkward and just spam. I don't enjoy the UX decision to tap the logo just to define the feed to either followers or favourites to avoid this. At the next update could you make this an account setting that can be turned off or on from the profile management and not a couple of clicks every time a user opens the app??,1
"The app really sucks at the moment. Last time the story says it allows 60 seconds, but then it changed and went back to 15sec only again. And not to mention the poor quality of the texts once it has been posted already. So annoying!",1
"So much problems in Android ig...when I make a reel with a music and save it in draft, after opening the draft later I found out the sound is gone even tho it's sill showing that I added it and it's there And also when I include text try to crop the timing of texts some of the video parts are missing to include the texts And doesn't really supports when I just simply crop or add a video after 2 or 3 times of adding and croping it doesn't work anymore ....there's many MORE of this kind of problem",1
"The app doesnt open for me. I dont know what it is but I try and open the app and it just shows a black screen. I've waited for it for 10 minutes and it still doesnt open. I've restarted my phone, deleted the app, force stopped it, trust me I've tried everything to make it work and it still doesnt. I have a samsung galaxy note 8 and I dont think there should be a problem with my phone starting up instagram.",1
"Compresses images so much you can see pixels without zooming in. Useless. Can't click any links, and can't even copy paste them. So dumb. Sends emails every single day ""Sorry to hear you're having trouble logging into Instagram"" and there's no way to stop it. I have disabled specific push notifications and the app still sends them.",1
"For the longest I hesitate in downloading this application and use the program? Finally decided to do it and OMG this is nothing but junk! App keeps telling me that it was unable to fit pictures, the feature to adjust the pieces is not working, locks up if you try anything else, like.... can you create anything else worthless than this? Impossible!!! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1
"My gallery photos are randomly out of order. I haven posted in ages because it's a hassle to scroll back through photos NOT in order. No idea why, haven't done anything to them or my phone. Also stop trying to be TikTok with Reelsü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èand enough of the celebrity and sponsored content it is so annoying. Furthermore there's a flaw where drafts doesn't show up as an option when you create from your profile but it does from your timeline page.",1
"Unusable - posts won't load on my feed or the explorer feed and reels or videos get stuck on the first frame and never load. This has been going on for months but the most recent update seems to have made it worse. Ive cleared the cache, uninstalled/reinstalled, switched off of wifi, etc etc and nothing resolves the issue. This is an app issue and the company/developers do not care",1
The app keeps crashing and glitching whenever I open it. I try uinstalling it but even that won't work and it still crashes. This doesn't have anything to do with my phone at all because my phone is extremely fast and has good connection. This is a problem that need to be fixed soon.,1
"About 3 weeks or more Instagram app don't work for me anymore, when i try to open the app it's just instagram logo and then it's just show a blank screen and don't work at all. I try to clear data and catch of app, delete and reinstall it multiple times, restart my phone, but it doesn't work at all. Fix it please.",1
"Sick of CONSTANT REPETITIVE ads!!!! I keep hitting hide/report, not relevant/see too often but they still keep popping right back up! üò° ENOUGH ALREADY!!!! üò° Settings to block doesn't help. Also, nellstricklandimre is using my pic/profile, reported multiple times but it's still there. REMOVE THEM ASAP!!! They do NOT have my permission to use my pic/profile!!!",1
"Too many problems recently. Crashings, can't upload external link on profile ""something went wrong"" message appears all the time , can't put music on reel, sometimes some amount of followers/recorded Reel's viewers were gone all at once and then went back suddenly to original number after a few hours/days.",1
"All of a sudden IG isn't allowing me to see all my available photos when posting. It also won't let me post multiple photos to my feed. Even when I go the opposite way, select the photos then ""share"", it only allows me to post to my story. What is going on?!",1
"Its so bad. Making an account was annoying because every time i went to the next slide, it fail to load it. And when i finished making the account, NOTHING LOADING. Nothing, not a single thing and it showed to same ""message status fail"" or something like that. Super annoying, i do not recommend",1
"The app cannot load my Gallery properly whether I try posting a Story, Post in Feed, or a Reel. I've cleared cache and checked app permissions. The app is also updated. The app is only showing blank rectangles and shows screenshots I've taken instead of the pictures I've taken. I've tried uploading from Gallery using the Share icon, so far this has worked for Feed but not in Stories.",1
"Very glitchy , my Instagram app isn't opening at all, it's just showing a black screen. Tried every possible way but still no result. Kindly look into it. Many people are facing this issue and it's a big problem.",1
"Worst update ever. I can't edit photos and posts, when posting more than 1 different photo, they all turn into the same photo. So weird. Also, audio sent through message can't be played. I can't see my activity, likes and comments. Worthless app",1
Like people have previously mentioned the last update made it impossible to pick from your phones photo library and you can't pick multiple photos when making a new post. Also my account for whatever reason is broken and I can't sent nor receive post comments in DMs. Support is entirely useless so good luck if you ever have an issue with your insta account because you're better off making a new one.,1
"My business account is now finally loading, after reinstalling and turning on and off my phone, but my personal still isn't refreshing, and it's just all black. No posts at all. No messages. It's showing that I've never had messages Update: my filters won't work now :)",1
"The algorithm which was working perfectly for me for years has changed for some reason and now all of the top stories are random and not of my close friends. It's amazing how much that makes the app for me, will probably delete if things don't go back to normal.",1
"Have been experiencing so many issues recently. I can't send posts , reels and even messages to anyone,it just keeps saying failed to send. While watching reels the music keeps on disconnecting. These are not minor issues so I hope these get fixed immediately.",1
"Everytime i posted a story, the text is different, all the captions error. U tried to restart the app, but it isn't work, now i still trying to upgrade the app, but the results my Instagram going cracks and slow response üò≠üò≠üò≠ i got mad with this app!! Please resetting this app for Android:(( it's going bad day by day, i hate it.",1
"It bugs out a lot. Every time I try to upload a reel, it just gets stuck, there's no way to cancel the upload and I can't swap accounts while it's in its endless loop. A cancel button would be quite a creative way to just stop the upload of a post",1
"Disappointed by the app. It has a lot of bugs for different users. Now i can't check my messages, the app closes for no reason even tho i have reinstalled the application. Others complain that they lost some futures like seeing the ""last active"" for the other users. It's a shame for such a user application to have so many huge bugs.",1
"I can't post multiple pictures because it only gives me the options for a few albums all of which show extremely old photos and nothing from the last several months. I can only access my pics through ""other"" which gives no option for multiple. Also the spam is unreal and won't stop.",1
"This app became a joke - I can't see what my contacts are doin, they non-stop show sponsored content and you don't know if you're on your own feed or not. Not only that, they changed the app and I get non-stop notifications for reels and they removed notification settings, so I can't even shut it up. I'm close to deleting the app as it became totally unusable other than private messages - I can use any other app for that.",1
"Literally as soon as I updated it yesterday it just started glitching and then I couldn't add accounts and then I tried to reset everything and the app opens up to a black screen even after uninstalling and reinstalling and it's pissing me off cuz I use Instagram for everything and I've tried everything to get it to work and it doesn't, it's so annoying like UH üò£",1
"what happened? the last time I can't switch accounts. Now, whenever I want to use Instagram, it will just turn into a black screen. I can't use it anymore. please fix this. I'm currently using instragram lite because this isn't working. I've tried clearing cache, reinstalling and restarting my phone but it just stays the same.",1
The app was working fine until the latest update. I tried making a post last night and none of the pictures I've taken over the past few weeks are showing up as choices to post. I've tried the help center and nothing was said to me about fixing it or even acknowledging that I have a problem.,1
"This app just gets worse as time goes on. Applying algorithms to the feed was the first step downhill, if I follow someone, their posts should pop in my feed. It should not be up to the arbitrary algorithm gods what I see from those I choose to follow. Now reels are being shoved down peoples throats, drowning out photos and increasing ad exposures. I guess they will erode everything for more money in the end.",1
When I go to post majority of my photos are missing. I have to search for the pictures in order to select them. It's only after I've posted the photo that they show up as an option to select. Extremely annoying and makes posting a hassle.,1
"This reels format just didn't work, let's accept this. It turned out that when you upload a video (even with 1920:1080 dimensions), it is automatically published as reels. And when IOS users try to share this reels to their stories, it is cropped as reels format, and the content just cut out. Why don't you fix it?",1
"For such a high profile app, poor. So many bugs all over the app. For an app with so many users, this is just unacceptable and unusable. Constant crashes randomly, always starts posts with multiple pictures/videos on the 2nd one for whatever reason",1
Can't upload photos from my Google pixel to post. I don't have access to all my photos to choose from and I can't post more than one photo at a time. Really frustrating trying to run my business and I can't use any photos my photographer sends me. I don't know if Instagram has some secret deal with apple but this app crashes constantly for Google/Android users...,1
"I've been using this app for about 6 years now and it's still not really improved. People use it because it's the only option, it's the only platform for photo posting professionally and they know that. The introduction of reels also heavily ruined this app, they destroyed the algorithm in favor of trying to be a tiktok clone, only pushing reels instead of photos- even though people only like it bc it's a photo sharing app. Instagram sucks",1
"Since January 23, 2022 i have been experiencing severe problems. I cannot select any emogi instead of love if i wanna like a message. Also i can't select a particular message to reply someone. These all happened after i entered into the beta version but didn't went away even after i turned it off. I'm very disappointed with such failures. I have been trying to complaint and contact for 2 months but till now nothing went well. üò†üò†üò†",1
"I feel that instagram has copied tiktoks addictive algorithim by promoting reels over pictures. Reels are not inspiraring!Theyre (rarely) entertaining. We want to see artists art, pictures of our friends. The only reason people are posting reels is because its the ONLY way to get traction to your account. If it was pictures that would get you traction, it woud be more enjoyable and people would post more pictures! Honestly its embarrassing to post pictures now because of how few likes they get.",1
"This app has absolutely terrible costumer service. People have been hacking accounts left and right and the resources to fight it are minimal. All of their help options are completely automated. You can't get ahold of anyone real over the phone nor through email. I am annoyed beyond belief. Not to mention that it seems geared to introduce teens to pornography. On a totally normal account, swiping through reels takes you to sexual content. It is simply not good",1
"Reels been posted upside down , i tried it for 5 to 6 times but same problem.. What happened to your app ?? Wow after updating app not even able to edit the clip of reel not even able to tap üòÇ who is the developer and who is tester god damn it üòÇ Hats off to them.. they fix one bug again bring the old one.. really appreciative team üëèüòÇ",1
"Sept 2022 and this app still sucks at making reels. I've uploaded videos where the sound was white noise, insta has squashed their own texts on my professional marketing videos, and they make editing videos in any way (adding music, text, etc) within it's own app so glitchy. I'm on an s22 (new!) And am getting these problems. How are they a multi billion dollar company? Branding. Definitely not tech.",1
When picking a song for reels it won't let me go past a certain predetermined amount of time which most of the time is shorter than my reel. Way too many suggested posts as well. Wasn't the discovery page for suggested posts??? Why is it on my home feed I liked having separate feeds for them,1
"App won't Work at all. Whenever I open the app, all I'm greeted with is a black screen, no matter how many times I uninstall/reinstall, clear the cache, restart my phone, or switch networks, I am unable to use the app and currently don't know what to so.",1
"I love how I'm able to upload multiple images at the same time. However, recently, I've been trying to upload pics we took, and I'm only able to upload one at a time, and I'm not able to upload from my phone, just certain folders.... let's not forget, it's been crashing a lot these last few weeks. This and Facebook.",1
"Can't access photo library - I think others are experiencing this issue as well? It only shows me a few photos that I've recently posted to IG, instead of my full photo library. When I try to navigate to the right folder, it only lets me select one pic at a time, can't do a series.",1
"Disabled for no reason. My randomly got disabled for no reason. What's worse is that I attempt to appeal, but it states I need to login to verify it's me first. I can't when it's disabled. It's a know glitch in the system with no solution for the users. I cannot reuse the username nor my email because of the state it is in. Horrible programming with no customer service.",1
"I have reinstalled the app, when I open it I am met with a black screen with nothing else. Old:It became so disgusting to use this app. All it does is shove you more and more ads wherever you turn even tho the app is full of bugs. All they want is money whilst not caring about the app itself nor it's user. Every other thing tends to crash, it resets the feed on it's own, large follower number creators get priority over smaller creators, I CONSTANTLY get ""my nudes"" spam... get yourself together.",1
Usually an OK experience and I enjoy it but now it's not letting me post photos?? It only lists existing photos on Instagram and has removed me from being able to add other photos?? I can do individual ones at a push but removed the 'add from photos' part for multiples. This has NOT been removed from my partners app. Just mine. Why how when ...why!!,1
Reels suck!!!!! We use Instagram for pictures. Not videos. Stop trying to be TikTok. I don't want TikTok. It's dumb. At least Instagram still shows everything in chronological order which Facebook quit doing. So at least I can see everything from my friends... Please keep it that way. But stop with the reels. Update: And now you started using stupid algorithms to show the feed instead of chronological order. Go back to chronological!!!!,1
"Everytime I scroll down the posts or open notifications or my own profile, the whole app closes, I've tried uninstalling it and installing it again and still doesn't work!!!! I don't know who's problem it is but pretty much it's not mine because I've checked everything and the phone works fine!",1
"Instagram reels has proven to be yet again an issue. Everytime I try to post a reel it flips it and makes it upside down. I've cleared cache, I've Uninstalled and re installed the app multiple times. I've logged out and back in. Im at a loss. Really disappointed.",1
"Reels keep changing from what i save them as. I just posted a reel and all the text was removed when it uploaded. Beyond that, there was no option to delete and save as draft, so i couldn't go back and re-add it. The workflow for creating reels is damn unusable.",1
"Used to love this for posting individual pictures of my travels easily, now it doesn't show my recent photos, only random photos from ages ago, or ones already posted to Instagram. Already posted them, dont want to choose them again. Can find the photos if click 'other' then select right section, but such a long winded process now for each individial photo makes it unbearable",1
Instagram has been buggy for a long time now. I keep being kicked out and signed out constantly without any reason while I didn't have this problem before. I can't post any pictures on my story from my gallery. I'm tired of all of the ads I see in between stories of people I follow as well. Just a greedy company looking for more money but don't give any features for people in return. such a trash app that is gonna be like facebook soon.,1
"Instagram is glitching. New photos that I have taken do not show up in the gallery section when I go to make a new post. So I have to open my files, scroll through and then I can only pick one photo at a time which is very annoying. Not worth it.",1
"At first, it kept crashing. Had to uninstall and re-install back. There's a lot of bugs, it's frustrating. After longing in to my account, I tried to log in to my other account but it won't let me. I don't know what happened to instagram. Can it please be fixed asap",1
For the past month now every time I try to post a reel it says that it can't be posted due to connection even when on Wi-Fi it's very annoying at first I thought it was due to being a beta tester so I left the beta testing program still doing it then I thought maybe it was due to an app update but the app's been updated since and still giving the same issue,1
"After latest update. I unfollowed a few people and it flagged my account as fraudulent ( it isnt) , locked me out, and password reset doesn't work. There is no one to reach out to ro fix it. It's useless and frustrating that there is no customer service AND they are controlling accounts like this with no way around it.",1
"Use to be amazing, but now, in addition to not supporting picture sharing, there are a number of other glitches - uploads not working, blank screens, scrolling lags, etc. Or seems as though they're looking to only support videos but the platform is not ready for that.",1
"EDIT: I have tried un-installing and re-installing the app 3 times now, as well as re-starting my phone, and still nothing has changed. I was logged out of my account after changing the password, and now I can't log back in; all I get is a black screen. I use Instagram for work, so I need you guys to get this fixed, ASAP.",1
"My Instagram app is not working from Last few days. I'm able to use my Instagram account on another device but its not working on my own device. Whenever I open my Instagram app blank screen appears, I've reinstalled app several times, cleared caches, also updated my phone still no change with the app. I'm able to use Instagram lite version but this application is not working at all. It's so frustrating please solve this issue as soon as possible .",1
App is not working. This is the 3rd day where I have not been able to use the app. Nothing is loading or refreshing. I can't even use the Instagram help option because the page doesn't refresh. I've tried logging out and unistalling the app and still not working. Does Instagram plan on fixing this problem? Because it's been for 5 days now.,1
"Since the update in July the app does not open on my android phone. I have been using the web version which has many issues on it's own, such as not allowing me to interact with stories and it isn't updating my feed. I keep getting days old posts from accounts I know post daily, if not multir times a day. The web version keeps suggesting I use the app, but it opens to a blank screen. Stop trying to be something you are not! If I wanted you to be like tic tok, I would just be on tic tok.",1
"there is no good reason to download this app. The most useful feature is the messaging, which can be replicated by other apps, and the rest full of ads and bad reels to keep you on the app in the hope that they can extract another half cent out of you. Don't download this app.",1
"One week passed and it's only a white blank screen whenever I open it. Same experience with other users that I tried updating, re-installing and all but it still shows only a blank screen. What the heck. It's seriously so frustrating, hope ig fixes this sooner.",1
This app gets worse with every update. The latest update has broken functionality and I am unable to upload more than one photo. I've been using Instagram for about 8 years and now it's time for something else. The push for Reels is also super annoying. I am disappointed that Instagram decided to ruin a perfectly good app.,1
"What's wrong with you Instagram?! There is always a problem with posting, editing and sharing. The ridiculous thing is about reels. I want to use filters and send to my friends but suddenly I see it is being posted. I want to post in my page and it says there is problem in editing! Instagram has been became awful and frustrating!!!!!!",1
"instagram is probably the biggest platform to get in touch with people but instagram is so focused on trying to change the algorithm instead of trying to fix bugs. Every groupchat im in, i can't delete videos, photos keep replaying after viewing, the groupchat wont delete, cant leave the groupchat etc. Reported this problem several times over the last few months and nothing is being fixed!",1
I just did the latest updation. Then after I can't see some of my posts. I don't know what happend. Some stories are loading some of the posts are loading. Anyone has this problem.? Any problem with this updation? I just opened some of pictures are error. Which says couldn't load retry again. Iam already refresh one or more times. But it's not working .,1
"Reels are the WORST! Please go back to photos only. Instagram is all ads and dumb videos now and as a content creator it has been an increasing struggle to get my posts seen as a result. Please, please, please at least create a feature to turn reels off or make them optional.",1
"This app is super buggy. There's always some kind of problem. Today people's profiles won't load for me. A few days ago, I wasn't receiving a bunch of messages. And there are a lot of annoying intentional restrictions too, like only being able to follow 7500 accounts, only being able to like/comment so much per hour, not being able to use 3rd party apps to manage followers, etc.",1
"Every time I open the app it gets stuck on a white screen, it's been like this for about a week now. I've tried all the necessary 'trouble shooting' suggestions but still nothing. So it looks like I will be uninstalling for good. Update: it's been almost a month and still the same problem",1
App won't even open after update. Elon wouldn't allow this to happen! I fixed this by logging on via the app on another device. This seemingly reset the issue on the original device. Doesn't work if you log on via Web browser.,1
I am facing a lot of difficulties in using Instagram for past 4 days. Instagram was down on 1st day so it was understandable but what about the next 3 days and even after my constant complaints no action was taken. I'm not able to view stories and not able to access reels properly. I tried reinstalling it several times and it worked too but only for few hours.I must say that I'm really really very very disappointed and not to mention irritated as well. Please do something about it,1
I've had an Instagram ady main source of social media for a long time but lately it's been crashing and when I go to make a reel the effects I added aren't uploaded to my finished version. Also sometime the filtered aren't available in your saved filters and there's no music available to add. Instagram has been crashing so much I'm gonna have to change my media platform,1
I got the app a month ago and it worked fine for me I guess because I was just using it to message a friend. But a few days ago the app wouldent work when I was trying to change my profile picture. I uninstalled the app and tried to log in but it kept on loading and even said I had a network problem but my internet/wifi was fine and was working for other apps. Just reinstalled it today and it won't even let me get to the log in page. Not happy because I can't message my friend üòï,1
"While adding music to reels, that music is not adding and there is some shhh sound at the background of my vedio... even m original audio is good only... iam using Instagram for my business. Fix that problem as soon as possible and my dashboard to not working... when I search maximum likes from insights it then coming to my home page... kindly fix this problem...",1
"Black screen with ""Meta"" logo, also look at all these 5* bots trying to hide the negative reviews! The only success I've had with my S20 is to open the chrome app and download the apk off the Play store from chrome. The downside is it only works in the secure folder(SF) that it defaults the download to. There is absolutely no way to move the app out secure folder or change the download location from chrome and a pin is required each time the app opens from SF.",1
"Like other users, I haven't been able to use the app for about 20 days now. I've tried reinstalling, installing previous versions, erasing cache and data, but nothing works. Honestly, if the most basic expectation one can have from an app is for it to work, Instagram is worth a generous 0.",1
Not designed for tablet. Forces portrait view always on a tab s8 ultra. Kinda sad that this is an issue on such a massive app.,1
Instagram is not working in my phone. App is opening but nothing is loading. I have tried a lot but it's not working.,1
Worst app toooo much buggy nothing is loading properly though I have a high speed data... Aaa serious problem with the app too irritating i am unable use the app please resolve it ASAP ...,1
"Imagine having to turn off wifi to watch a video or get an image to load. The app is buggy and the people behind it keep making changes that make it harder to use the app for what feels like no reason. Yall ain't Twitter, yall ain't tiktok, so why Instagram trying so hard to not be Instagram. Edit: using data doesn't always work sometimes ur just gonna have to sit there for 10 mins waiting for the video to decide to play. Why do yall keep moving the past likes tap omg!!!",1
My account suddenly stopped working and its annoying because I don't even post much or use it. And it was my only private account with friends and family so i am really pissed because the customer service is the worst.,1
"Used to be great for sharing photographs. I use it for sharing pictures of what Iam working on as a textile designer. Now it is impto s any relevant posts as there are so many ads and suggestions and the preferences are towards video. If I wanted video I would be on Tictoc. Huge disappointment and am moving to Vero as a static, photo based sharing platform",1
After you upload young file the quality the resolution of the file drop to almost its looks like you want to delete it!!!,1
"Utterly baffling that they are trying to ""pivot to video"" without giving users a choice in the matter. The suggested posts are lackluster, clickbaity and a true case study of how recommendation systems can utterly backfire. I see this platform to be dead or permanently changed for the worse by the end of the year unless reels are removed and users are given direct control over the ""suggestions"". This includes the bonkers approach to tags that for some reason has further ""content quality"" metrics",1
My Instagram keep crashing and I can't make reels..... When I put the video it just becomes dark n can't see n not able to edit,1
I have been constantly trying to log in my account but it keeps showing that I need to enter a 6 digit code which never came . I have also tried submitting the video selfie but it gets cancelled the mid way . Now I am completely logged out of my account and find ni way to log back in . I can't even create a new account as it keeps showing me to try later .,1
"my instgram page deactivated, i tried to reach Instagram support team but there ia no support, even i submit apeal form that doesn't work... Now Instagram Development team you tell me is there any way to reach intagram support team.",1
This is very slow app i face many problems like hanging again and again posted a story taken to much time when i am trying to upload a story is shows an errorüôÇ and story doesn't upload,1
Very bad app don't install it because it has been irritated me again & again coming ads on my screen automatically.,1
"It's been long time I have been using this but my account deleted 5 times and there is no filter option also the music option is not available. And now the reels option is not showing. 28 September, Again Instagram deleted my account for the 8th time. I'm just fade of it. It is the worst app I ever seen.",1
"The app suddenly crashed, I don't know how many times do I have to report it. I was just like enjoying my time scrolling and then all of a sudden it will just crash. I thought its just because of some minor issues of my phone but its a big ""NO"" I'm so glad that I'm not the only one experiencing some issues with the app itself. Can you please do something about it, a lot probably of your users are affected.",1
It's has become so boring won't even feel like uploading pics as nobody sees it and no one gets more likes. If the story only matters it's better to use snap chat.,1
"Can't find any sort of support anywhere. My phone factory reset itself while it was in my backpack, and I had two factor authentication on. The backup codes were lost as well because of the reset. Can't even ask about a possibility of account recovery or even deleting my account. The only pictures of me on there are years old, so I couldn't do the video verification. Must be true that they really don't care about their users.",1
"August 13, 2022 I'm supposedly taking selfies but there is an error that really annoys me. The filters won't work, only the colored filters (Sharpen, saturation, etc.) The face filters won't work. Second, my Instagram messages kept disappearing. It only shows up when somebody chats. My Instagram messages means a lot, please fix it.",1
Suddenly from a week I guess.. Most of the stories that I'm viewing are where song is added I'm unable to hear. The reels to I watch plus the reels I hve uploaded don't have the song. Uninstalled and installed the app so many times nothing works. But the same story or reel I view from a different account I'm able to hear the sound.,1
I've had Instagram for years and its LITERALLY not working at all. My messages wouldn't send until hours later. I couldn't view stories or see post. Plus if someone sent me something i wouldn't get notified. I have uninstalled and downloaded it back but its just a blank white screen so i cant log in. I checked to see if it was my internet or phone but it's not since all my other apps worked perfectly but this one,1
"its literally got un useable for some reason, app keeps crashing,i cant use the camera feature, even for open≈üng dms and sending messages i have to just try and hope that it doesnt crash immedietly. i cant open the app itself by clicking on the icon it only opens when i click on a notification and even then it just crashes and leaves me to try again and again. i KNOW its not because of my device because its not an old model & i have friends who experience the same thing over and over again",1
"UPDATE: STILL NOT WORKING BEEN NEARLY 1 WEEK...... .I have an s22plus and the app is not opening nor does it crash. It just stays completely black and no response until i remove it. I have no idea what is happening i tried turning off my phone, clear data, update phone softwarr but it still wont open and shows a pitch black screen. Please help!",1
"Currently I cannot post new photos from my samsung s21 ultra. When I go to upload a photo on the feed page by hitting + it only gives me like 6 pictures to choose from - I can't scroll through my gallery and select the photos I want to upload unless I select ""options"". However that only works for 1 photo. If I want multiple photos selected - ""other options"" doesn't pop up. If I go to my gallery and select the multiple pictures and then share to instagram - It only goes to post a story. Annoying",1
"Stopped letting me upload stories longer than 15 seconds, the segments afterwards would ""fail to upload"" no matter what I tried. Then MONTHS later I got a notification saying there's longer stories now. This lasted less than 18 hours before going back to breaking it into segments, and then not uploading the other ones after the first. It's a small thing but it's so frustrating, fix this.",1
"Since almost past 2 months I haven't been able to open and use Instagram as it is. When I open, all I can see is a black screen. Now I am managing with Instagram lite, which isn't anywhere nearly as good as the actual one. Please help. Itried all the lastest 3 updates and still no use.",1
I deactivated my account sometime back and now I can't even login for some days now. Kindly resolve this issue. App has gotten really glitchy.,1
"Instagram keeps glitching and and bugging all the time. The updates in Poland are not the same like in the US. I don't have options in chat like changing theme, reacting with different emoji, I can't send songs to my friends ect. The app works slow on both android and ios. Sometimes ig freeze and I have to reopen it or reset my phone although other apps work fine I wish I could delete it but It's one of the most popular social sites and I have all of my friends here with whom I chat..",1
"Instagram is trying to be 2 things at once (2017 instagram and tik tok) it makes for a terrible experience for everyone, nobody asked for instagram to be like tik tok, thats what tik tok is for. Not only does this hurt instagrams identity but it also comes with several bugs and inconsistencies especially when instagram is having several updates that change the UI for no reason, nobody likes 10 UI changes every month, its annoying and absolutely nobody is happy with your platform.",1
"I really don't like how the texts I wrote on my stories aren't readable. It's ruining the post. I love instagram because it changes my perspective about social media :) I learned how to post stories online with different varieties of layouts, stickers, time designs, filters, etc. Pls, insta fam, fix this :( Though I know you're not a text kinda app, it still matters.",1
"Up until about three weeks ago my explore page and suggestions were pretty accurate to my interests. Then for some reason I started seeing Bible quotes and an increasing amount of Christian content. I'm a queer nonbinary atheist. I'm into gay books, recuse cats, and figure skating. At no point have I ever followed, interacted with, or even looked at religious content to make the algorithm think I would be interested in getting bombarded with Jesus every time I open the app. Please make it stop!",1
Worst experience with this app my account disabled for copyright but I haven't uploaded anything except my pics and after that i created another account it also disabled in 1 day with same reason and i didn't upoad a single pics but reason was for copyright so i just hate that app now,1
I'm givig one star to this because when I am applying reel to my story I don't have the option to save the story in my camera roll . Solve my problem . Hurry up ! .,1
"It's not good anymore. Instagram used to be wonderful highway with no traffic signals and no ""hurt-you-algorithims"". It used to be a friendly place to still images and sharing artists. But No longer üíî now Instagram has turned into that annoying younger cousin that just wants to copy everything the ""other cuz does"" and has lost all originality. It has fallen deep into the well of ""Tiktok"" and looks ridiculous while trying to be someone else.",1
"App has been unusable lately. Doesn't load photos and videos, it's constantly loading. Tried closing the app, clearing cache, uninstall and install again, restarting the phone. Nothing works.",1
"That sum bugs are irritating that means 1. certain time giving me restrictions in i can't do anything . that's why I am giving this rating , as your team solve this problem i will definitely cancel this rate",1
I hate when you try to save your story with a sound but when you save it. It doesn't have any sound and i hate it,1
"There's to many bugs on instagram lately after new updates versions which i had to uninstall and reinstall the app just to work properly. Reels, blank screen, sending messages (it takes many minutes to be send), availability of music region in feed and in story, and everything else. + what i've been seeing too are the porno/nudity advertisement a lot of pages been working with, please take care of the action silently to remove every bots account they're being payed for from someone! Thank you!",1

The app does not work anymore...it had some crashes and then turned into a white screen. I uninstall and reinstall again for several time...and the same thing. I have a business page and this is the worst thing that can happen to a business profile.,1
Super buggy since last update. Crashes frequently. Crashes anytime you are in the shopping section for more than a few mins,1
Awful... This app keeps crashing.. No matter what you're doing. I am trying to open dashboard it crashed... Deleted draft reels automatically again and again... Leaving Instagram app for a while bcz it takes me extra time to create any videos and this app keeps crashing whatever i do.. and keep deleting draft videos... So i am done with this...,1

I have emailed the developer contact (don't waste your time btw. It just gets ignored) So whatever has been done at the last update seems to have created all manner of problems for everyone. Please fix it. Thanks",1
"i use insta like everyday, but there's 2 THINGS THAT HAS BEEN ANNOYING ME 1. ads everywhere like seriously 2. there's this thing that where you post your story there's a glitch or extra lines (green/black/white) especially if your story has texts which is VERY VERY VERY annoying i tried to uninstall the app but it BECAME WORSE. please do fix this ASAP",1
"They won't let me in to my own account - even with the video selfie (they can't verify that I'm me). My old phone screen is completely broken, so I can't get into my app/photos to see my two-factor codes and other than that, the only method to get in is for me to send them a video of me that that deny is me. There is absolutely *no* support for this at all. I'm logged into Facebook on my new phone and I can't even ""continue with Facebook"" though the two accounts are linked. TERRIBLE.",1
What's wrong with IG stories??? I can't stay that long watching some of the stories my friends uploaded And even if i tried to look back the previous post it kept on turning to the nextü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,1
Upload quality and time is horrible. Any thing you Upload has a low quality and takes for ever to Upload sometimes you need to Upload it multiple times to get it up there,1
"I used to be able to scroll and see all my friends and family. Now, all I see are ads and reels. I only use IG. No FB, Twitter, tok tok, snap. I wish we had our personal feed to be able to just see people we followed and another section to browse strangers if we chose to.",1
"Intsagram software engineers never figured out how to remove the bugs in this program. Overall, a generally negative experience.",1

"Anytime I try to click in a link whether it's in a bio or story, I get redirected to the browser version if the login page or my own home page again. It's been at least a week like this. I tried clearing the cache and memory, uninstalling and still the same. And the occasional freezing as well",1
"Pathetic app... Automatically stops responding.. Auto log out... Despite of setting multi factor authentication, it doesn't support the access code. Tried other options as well (including Text, WhatsApp, Email, & backup code as well). Nothing works. I'm not able to log in my Instagram account.",1
"The app has been much slower lately. 1 : I can't access my full Profile Pic 2: Every time I try to put my PHONE NUMBER in, it doesn't work ! 3: It started lagging even though it never done it before this App isn't the same as it was before pls fix it! üò† We all want the original Version of Instagram this had me thinking ....

"Instagram is turned out to be another Facebook, content on feed is mess (getting feed from past days which are viewed already), even though there's no interaction with any of the posts or reels, but gettings suggestions on feed. I've blocked many adds but still they appear on the feed. Correct the issues on feed. I will re-visit and update reviews.",1
Instagram keeps crashing. Sometimes I have a white screen. I have reinstalled but getting fed up of the same repeated issues of Instagram either crashing and not opening app or white screen before crashing. I'm glad I don't run a business from this app. It would be disastrous.,1
"This application is buggy and messy on my device, unfortunately i am seeing a lot of type of bugs such as restarting of my phone when I click Reels, animation freezes and delays in messages in Direct. TikTok is much more stable than Instagram, my question, what developers of Instagram do? It seems that they don't work properly",1
My Instagram app is not working from last 1 week. I am able to use Instagram on other devices and also clone version but the orginal app is not working on my device. Once I open the app nothing appear expect a black screen. I have reinstall app several times still it's not working. I am facing this first time after using Instagram from 5-6 years. I've reported this problem several times but it has not resolved till now. It is so irritating. So plz solve this problem as soon as possible,1
"Doesn't even work. I have seen posts about pictures and things not loading because of slow internet. But my internet has no issues, very fast, and I can still only load one picture and the rest is black. Nothing I do fixes this. Pretty much no point in opening the app at this point",1
Just like so many other people after updating the app it will not open and instead just shows a blank white screen now. I've tried every possible fix that I could find online and nothing solves the problem. The app was working fine before I updated it. I can't believe that the developers of this app simply broke the Android version of it and have not bothered to fix it.,1
App won't show all the photos in my phone when I go to make a post. So I only have about four photos to choose from when making a post which means that I really can't post anything until they fix this glitch. Really frustrating but I wouldn't expect any more from meta.,1
"App keeps crashing as of 9/22/22. Have reinstalled twice but doesn't help. Sound off in reviews if this is happening to you too. The more people complain the more they're inclined to fix it. Have a blessed day. Unless you work for insta, do your damn job. Respectfully.",1
"Can someone please explain why suddenly Instagram gives me a blank page instead of the login page, when I launch the app? I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling, clearing cache etc... Nothing happens. I'm on Android. I can access through a web browser but the experience is not optimal. Please help.",1
Something is VERY WRONG with this app. I can no longer post ANYTHING without the entire app crashing and completely exiting out of the entire app. It is EXTREMELY odd and frustrating and has been going on for MONTHS. I thought I was going crazy until I read other reviews. FIX THIS IMMEDIATELY.,1
"Horrible service. Randomly locked me out of logging in and after following the protocol to get my account back they couldn't confirm I was me after sending about 15 selfie videos through their system. I get it, instagram is super popular but YOU CAN LOSE YOUR ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME. And there's no way to work with someone to get it back (at least so far). I've been locked out of my account for almost a month.",1
"Instagram you need to address the issue that so many of us our having. Unable to log in, blank screen, and no response from your HELP department. I like so many have uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared cache, checked updates etc, and nothing works. I can only access the web version which is slow and really awkward to use. Please fix this ASAP!",1
"I uninstalled the app a few days ago, but now that I installed it again my Messenger app features (such as, responding to messages, reacting to messages with different emojis) are gone. Not only that, but I cannot find a way to get the update back, which seems to be a general problem since a lot of my friends have also been unable to install this update.",1
"Is not possible to rate with 0 stars, but if it was, that would've been the one. I don't know if it's just me but I've been having trouble with the app for a week now, it just doesn't load anything. I've tried everything and nothing seems to solve the problem, the only ""hack"" I managed to apply was to uninstall the app and then install it again so it would work for a short time. If I close the app and open it again, it goes back to the ""doesn't load"" mode and it's frustrating.",1
"The whole app is slow and when I sent videos, photos, or even messages, sometimes all 3, it gets even slower and I can't even use it. I no longer can add or make new accounts, even just turned black, I get backed out of Instagram when I open dms too. The entire app sucks.",1
I am unable to post reel from my account from more than 7 days. I don't know what is happening. All of a sudden m unable to do it after updating the app. My network is fine. Then what's the problem?? I already have report a problem through the app and sharing a screenshot also but no response from your side. Such a big platform but worst service üò°üò° really disappointed. Till now I am unable to post any single video. Pls fix this issue as soon as possible. Bcz m handling a professional account.,1
"Good photo and video sharing platform. Easy to use. But there are many bugs. Sometimes 'your turn' feature dosen't work, sometimes other stickers don't work. Sometimes they remove music from your content month later and also they remove your sound at all leaving muted videos...",1
"he app is not very user friendly. Many hidden features and gestures that are not following standards. Text in unsent messages disappears if you (by accident) leave the app, which means you are not able to copy/paste from another app without removing all yout text.. You can't add links, video/picture to collections, and if you you do the wrong gesture the store/reel will disappear.. . All in all a very unforgiving app. Not very user friendly...",1
Your new update with default photos going to the location of the previous posts is stupid. Now you have to navigate to your folder which doesn't allow for selecting multiple files. Stop changing stuff just to change it. It's annoying you never improve anything.,1
"This app literally doesn't work anymore. I tried reinstalling the app because I was getting a black screen for months trying to re-add a new account. Now the app won't open AT ALL. Absolutely ridiculous! I use this app for my work and a main point of contact for my clients, and I can't even open it at all.",1
"App won't even let me open it up at this point. Uninstalled and reinstalled and still nothing. Update: now notifications don't work at all. Update 2: NOW OUR CALLS ARE MESSED UP. One of us is constantly upside down. It isn't out phone settings either. Seriously Instagram, fix your app for once. Update 3: Giving up on this app. Closes out immediately everytime I try to open it. Idk why you guys cant properly run this app.",1
"Bruh it's been on the fritz for like almost a month and it's really annoying. I can't see photos my friends send me, I can't see videos, I can't see posts, I can't see stories, and I can't listen to voice messeges. It's like it's always on loading but it never does. I've un-installed and reinstalled insta to see if it'll get fixed. It did only for a day and then it was back to not working again üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ Edit: It's still not working",1
"OVERALL I love the app but what's BOTHERING me is whenever I log in to my acc!!!! I saved it but it doesn't work! So I did the recover email and put my new password it still won't work! It always says: ""Sorry we couldn't complete your request... Blah blah blah"" And it's literally bothering me! What a waste of time honestly. If this is what always happens then it might better to never ever install this app! Sorry if I sounded like a Karen but I'm just frustrated at this point...",1
The IG app hasn't been working for me the last 3 days as I have gotten a white/blank screen every time I launch it. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and resetting my phone but am still having the same issue. I have been able to log into my account via incognito web browser but this is not the solution I need. Disappointed and requiring support.,1
"The app makes edits to my photos without my input. If I long-press to do a comparison, suddenly the color and and contrast are permanently changed. This happens consistently and wastes so much time, I don't even want to post anymore.",1
"App is becoming more and more useless. The updates are unwanted and becoming very annoying, They are trying to hard to become like ""Tik Tok"" and that makes me want to never get on this app again. Used to be great but with all of these new features that are pointless the app is becoming exactly that. Pointless.",1
"While scrolling the videos stop playing but you can still hear the voice you must go to the next video and then slowly come back and then you can watch the video. While watching stories the next story does not work or load so you have to go to the next or precios story then go to the one you wanna see then it works , its very bad if all this would work i would rate it 5 stars but so far is bad bad bad üëé sry you must improve",1
"I tried updating the all several times , the update is getting downloaded but unable to install ,I have checked the device compatibility it is alright, but I am unable to update it , also there are many bugs and issues recently , I sometimes recive messages very late , I get the notification for message but it is not visible in chat , the app crashes after opening any link or something etc , sometimes same 3-4 reels are shown repitvely . please solve the update and other issues",1
"have been using this app for two years now , and I've often faced minor glitches which are fixable . But from the past 12days , whenever I try opening the app I'm welcomed with a blank white screen instead of the login page . I've tried everything : switching off my device , rebooting my device , uninstalling and reinstalling the app , clearing the cache , etc. And the issue remains unresolved . I hope Instagram team does to something to fix this ASAP . I'm really dissapointed in Instagram this",1
I was unable to add a separate account after already adding 2 others with no problem. When I went to add the separate account my screen went black. So I logged out of all my accounts hoping to reset everything and still a black screen. I then Uninstalled and reinstalled the app and now reinstall I click on the app my screen goes black and I cannot access anything on the app. Meanwhile the internet version is still active and functioning,1
"- way too many ads (a quarter of content, insane) - recently only recommends random reels (i'm literally only here for pictures) - forces the use of integrated browser for all external links (for extra tracking) - app keeps bugging out, falling into light mode with light text, as well as breaking chat's entry box Terrible in multiple ways.",1
"Stop suggesting I follow somebody I've never heard of, with whom I have nothing in common with. And so suggesting friends you snoop out of my phone book! I have several thousand contacts in my phone book, most that I would never follow nowadays on Instagram. I'm not interested. Stop that! Instagram needs a changeable user location that the user can change, when at a distant place for months and not muting to see events from another place. Get with the times!",1
"Latest update Issue. Before update could crop pictures when selecting multiples, but now will not let me. When trying to crop through the edit menu, under adjust, when click done image is over zoomed and blurry. Why!? I like new image selection screen, hate that I can crop my images. Still hate the unusable dashboard with a passion",1
"Why Instagram is so full of bug these few months? Blurry videos, and so many problems with ig stories. When you post it, suddenly all the edit are gone. Even all the videos, post n reels are blurry in the first few seconds. Instagram is not as smooth as it used to be.",1
"When I open the app it just shows an empty white screen or black if the dark theme is on. I have deleted all data. Uninstalled, reinstalled, the same happens. I have sent an email to instagram support, no answer. I installed the app in my phone's second space and it does work, yet not in my main space.",1
Poor update. Can't even hit a like button as the post is stretched beyond the screen. Simply awful update - been one instragram for ages but likely to delete after this update. CEO is happy with the failed experiment - now adding anothet fail button for reels where there used to be an add story button. Please remove the update and the person in charge,1
Pathetic.after update I'm unable to use it on my device. Screen turns blank and i m able to use on my system with limited features. Tried connection with the support team but it has miserably failed to support the users. Team try to fix bux as it's really irritation and has created a gap between me my business and the usage of app. Whenever i open app it's a blank page with no option.,1
My insta keeps getting white background after I open a site on it or watch some reels. The font also being white makes it hard to read so i would have to restart again. And then the voice synching in reels is pathetic. The voice keeps being forward from my video no matter how much I try to lip sync. And it keeps glitching.,1
"No matter how good my signal or wifi, every single bleeding reel on this godforsaken app will start, and then stop loading. Everytime i want to share something, it will take more than a minute of loading time, even if it is just to share a link, which is plain text. Consistently worse everytime it has been updated. Cannot wait for meta to collapse so that civilisation can move forward again.",1
"I'm sorry but what is wrong with the app nowadays? It's been a week and I can't log into my account! When I open the app it's blank, just white background and nothing else! Had the same problem with switching the accounts, which is why I deleted and installed the app many times, tried reloading my phone but NOTHING works.",1
Extemely disapointing to watch this app slowly turning into a graveyard of reposted tiktok videos. Up until today I was still able to post regular horizontal videos to my feed but now that option appears to have been removed completely. I am extremely unhappy with the direction this app is headed in. Having a nice place to share photos with my friends was a good expirience and I will likely delete my account if that ceases to be instagram's main function.,1
"This app doesn't give me the options of swiping the message to reply and also it isn't possible to send gifs and stickers, my app is up to date but still my friends have these functions in their account and I don't. I am so disappointed, I reported the problem so many times but didn't even get a single response, pathetic service.",1
The app does not load anything if I switch from data to wifi (low bandwidth) while using the app. I've to always terminate the app and reopen. It's been like this for years and was hoping you would notice and fix it. Will change my review after fixing this.,1
"I was doing a security checkup on my account, and my email is verified. But I went to go reset my password. I forgot my old one and clicked ""Forgot Password"". Instagram is telling me an email is sent out with a link to reset my password. But I'm not receiving any emails to actually do that! Nothing is in my spam folder and bots responding aren't helping me out. Even spent awhile on the support page and found nothing to solve this problem. 2-Step is not working either when I go to edit it.",1
"Instagram is trying so hard to be the new tiktok that it's just becoming a boring app. I don't want to be on tiktok, if I did I would be there, not on Instagram. Reels are already the main content, the photos and regular videos are disappearing, which is extremely frustrating. Why would I want to be on a lame tiktok when I can be on the real thing? Instagram is pushing people away, and I really can't wait for another app to appear and take the place that Instagram is giving up.",1
"This could be the best app but the feed and the ads are the worst. First off, the feed is a jumbled mess of random posts and not in any order that makes any kind of sense. Next is the ads. Holy moley! I get it's a free app but to be bombarded with ads every 3rd post is more than excessive. And nothing, NOTHING you do as a user will fix this. Try to hide or report an ad? Well hold onto your butt because they'll ignore your action or slide another ad in it's place.",1
"A continually worse user experience since FB took it over, ending the chronological scroll, introduction of Reels to fill the Vine void & compete with Tik Tok, the icon change, the autoplay, the issues with reporting accounts & nil change after preferences are voiced, now there are bugs aplenty, leading to unexpected crashes, post failures, incorrect mapping features, the embodiment of a sh!tshow omnishambles.",1
"No customer service assistance. My account is unable to post reels. I have tried everything, uninstalling, updates, app permissions/settings. It's not my internet connections and noone is getting back to me. Literally would take someone 2 minutes to assist with my issue. Used to love Instagram but without any assistance it completely hinders use.",1
"Random people show up in your feed, never actually get to see what your friends are posting because it's all just suggestions. Reels are really really annoying and seem to be the only thing the app wants to recommend for you. Bring back photos and posts from people you follow please.",1
"The app doesn't work after the latest update, nothing loads, whether it's reels shared by friends in DM, searching for new friends accounts, trying to upload pics, etc. It just keeps loading without any result. The older version that I was using for more than one year now worked great.",1
How do I pause a freaking Instagram reel the first try every time? I be pressing on the screen and It works when it wants to.... I have to watch a video 20 times just to pause it where I need it.... I can't be the only one having this issue.... This is my second phone and still have issues........After I wrote a review I decided to read the comments and then I remembered this is now a Facebook company and Facebook doesn't care about their user experience so they're not going to reply to anybody.,1
"I've been using it for marketing since '20. Because I did not pay for ads not only I struggled to get audience wasting time, but I was constantly blocked for no reason from increasing it. Therefore I had to apply workarounds to keep it alive. 1 account was removed. All this because it assumed I was using a robot. No answer from them on this. It displays ads after each of my posts. I work, they get paid. ""Fair!"". The reach of the posts is extremely low, rarely over 1-200, no matter what. NOTOK!",1
"What is happening with this app? I cannot log in my account because the screen just turns entirely black when I open it. Instagram has become an integral part of my social media and day to day activities, and this happening is really a let down. Please fix this immediately. I can see that a lot of people also experience similar issues. I am willing to change my rating into 5 stars if this get fixed as soon as possible. Please do read and listen to your users' feedback.",1
Tf is going on? Suddenly adding a new post won't show my camera reel?? And moving the Copy Link button to another place?? That was a very unnecessary and stupid update! All the ads and reels I'm not even interested in are annoying enough. Just let us post our photos and videos already! The old Instagram was better than this paid social media circus!!!,1
"Pointless notifications: Ive been using this app for many years and over the past year it has grown exceedingly annoying, despite turning off notifications for everything I dont want, Instagram will send me notifications about accounts posting that I don't even follow. Even despite turning off notifications about friends posting reels, I still get notifications, the only way to rid yourself of these notifications is to turn them all off completely.",1
My App is continuously crashing after updating a app on 22 September on my device OPPO F11 Android version 10. Please fix this bug asap. I am using Instagram version 253.0.0.23.114.,1
"Ever since I re-downloaded Instagram a few days ago, whenever I open it, it just shows a blank screen. I've tried multiple things to fix this, not to mention I've seen another review with this problem, meaning it's probably not a problem with my phone but Instagram.",1
"Use to work well. Now not at all. Just change my phone and can not connect to my account anymore. Keep asking me for a double authentificator. When I do, the code does not work. When I try to get some help, I never receive the email. Very disappointing",1
It becomes so boring and it tights you in a way that you feel you have to obai the Instagram rules and there is zero flexibility of how you you can act with it... There's too many ways that can take the app to a different level or at least to take it back to its original glory and make it the Game of Thrones app. Good luck Khalil ajouz,1
Lots of ads while watching some educational content . It is distributing elements for the students.,1
"Add an option to block out videos that have the same exact copy and pasted sounds as tens of thousands of other videos. Once you've seen one, you've seen them all. Closed this app many times due to seeing the exact same concept of a video recorded by yet another ignorant boring person thinking they have a chance at being famous. If you don't start letting people know there's no shot at their boring lives going viral, more people will become aware that the entertainment is way too watered down.",1
This is not fear Instagram I will login my id from many days but it doesn't login confirmation code doesn't send to my phone no... 24 hours option comes but after 24 hours it will not comes again this is very bad,1
"The app is good, it works. But the new beta version, which will probably be in the regular version, is horrible, bad colors, bad design, bad everything. I hope they keep it the way it currently is.",1
I can't get back into my account bc of the authentication code. There is no support to help me. I tried resetting my password. Nothing is working,1
"I can't create Instagram account on my phone please help me.whenewer i am create Instagram account every thing is ok on before instagram term condition option but after i am clicking on this option there are write down as a ""some thing went wrong please try again""",1
Useless and stupid app Older post feature shows all the pics and videos other than people i'm following. Always deliver posts late to me All the posts it get are always 20 to 25 mins late No matter how many times you refresh posts will be delivered late,1
"Too many ads. Reels are not working, the autoscroll needs to go away. I can't use this app. Every day it seems to change and not for better... Update September 1, 2022. I can't view comments on anyone's posts, my home page is a blank screen and doesn't show posts of people I follow. September 22, 2022. App won't even open anymore",1
"cant find the apps log in screen, deleted the app for a few days and the installed it again and now only shows a black screen. i tried changing my wifi connection, updating, deleting cache and date, and it still doesnt work. instagram please do something to fix this",1
"I have been using it for long time.. I uninstalled it for some reason before,, but now it doesn't log in or doesn't create an account.. Fix it quickly,,,",1
"I logged out of my account and the page went blank. I have uninstalled, installed, and restarted many times for a week now. What is wrong with this app? I have seen many other users are complaining about this, but the problem still exists. Please either fix it, or issue a guideline.",1
"It's Pathetic, Instagram app is not at all working in my phone, whenever I am installing it it's just showing blank page. This issue is there since last one month and I don't know, why you people not even resolving it. .... It Been more than 1 month, with these issue, Is there any fix for it?",1
"You have very bad, useless, careless, errorful login system. Everytime when i want to login it show the password is wrong and when i try to reset my password through the email from instagram, the link i got from instagram email , it shows the link is invalid everytime again and again. And there is no any other better option to login my account. Please fix this problem immedietly. Thank you",1
"Bugs and glitches the function still the same but it just terrible right now. For example, sometime, if you wanna share your story to your close friend only, it will send it publicly and for no absolute reason the app is crash.",1
Unable to add videos or share videos with anyone. Absolutely no service as they have too many users and too many bugs are killing this app every day,1
"So very enjoyable app. And most motivational and inspirational video very very unique Reels. A app very best post, reels and story.",1
"my instagram works perfectly fine before. i dont know what happened, everytime i post a story with texts or stickers, the text is distorted so as the stickers. i dont know if people also experience this problem. please fix it as soon as possible. it tirggers my anger issues. thank you.",1
"Ever since META took it over it's been advertisment garbage. For every one of my friends posts, I see 4-5 adverstisements or ""recommended for you"" posts. It's become tedious to see what is going on in my friend's lives. Thats the biggest problem as of late, although the ""click here for older posts"" thing drives me nuts too. I've never seen a corporation botch a simple business model so badly. Its almost as if they bought Instagram to destroy it in favor of Facebook.",1
The app now freezes up. It still freezing up and closing. Why can't i save audio?,1
App not working. As suggested I have uninstalled and tried to reinstall. It now won't install and is giving me a constant error.,1
Process of deleting an account is horrendous by on purpose. Asked you to log in while you are still log in and only allowing temporary deactivation. I'm considering of purposely breaking their guidelines just to get ban.,1
"With each update instagram is becoming more and more like tiktok and it sucks! We don't need more apps like tiktok ffs. Now all videos are automatically ""reels"" as they call it, which is instagram version of a tiktok. I miss when this app was focused on photosharing instead of reels...",1
Since upgrading to the pixel 6 I'm having trouble uploading photos to my feed. I can add to my story easy but when I try to upload photos it seems to make me go a long way round to get to the camera roll and then will only let me upload one photo. If I go into my photos and select multiple and try to share to Instagram I only have the option to share to my story and not my feed. As a result of this I'm not using the app as much as I'd like to. Is this me being thick? Or is there a solution?,1
My Instagram keeps crashing and producing a black screen. I can't log in to any of my accounts or even use the app. Seems to be a common problem. I've reinstalled countless times.,1
It's just has too many bugs and it is keep on increasing after every update. Instagram should fix it once and for all,1
My note option is not available even after i update this app and after updating my reels also not visible and my music option is also not there..,1
"Keeps kicking me out everytime I try to open the app,whenever i like a reel it pauses,I've downloaded a 8 gb game on my phone in 10 minutes but a message on insta takes a whole 14?the pictures on the music never show up,lyrics are delayed,it crashes whenever i try to post 10 pictures all in all bad app",1
"After Facebook purchased Instagram, it was okay at first now its pretty bad... Lots of ads just like Facebook. No way to check most recent posts of followings.",1
"The app was working fine until it suddenly stopped working a couple of days ago. It won't load or show any details now. I tried logging off and logging back on, Updated it, I also Uninstalled & Reinstalled it again but nothing worked!! Giving it one star, a üëé and Deleted it in one week if not fixed!!",1
This app ignores you're android mute settings and still plays sound. Whoever thought that was a good idea needs a slap. So annoying.,1
"Some time ago I tried to log into my one another account but whenever I choosed the option ""log into existing account"" it was just blank screen(Same with the ""create new account"" option, I tried). I decided to delete the app and try to log in again, but this time any time I open the app it's just blank screen. I read reviews here and saw that people have the same problem as me and I'm not the only one. I hope you can fix this bug ASAP.",1

It's absurd that I'm still getting notifications of new posts my best friend who died more then a year ago.. Why is this app so popular anyway? What's the point??,1

"Too annoying suggested accounts in the feed, suggested ads that i hate & irritated are too many in the story section and the video interface is awful it won't let me play a specific part of the video, always have to watch the whole video to see that specific part",1

It makes so insecure to use it. Please don't spam. I have privacy. IG really spy on my phone. I really hate it. Once you search something in online shop, the ads will appear hundreds in IG. So scary.",1
Instagram is getting worse day by day. First they put shopping in place of notification. Now they have remove the music option from post. Please bring back all the old features. Or we have to uninstall it.,1

"Instagram has the worst customer service. My account was hacked, and they haven't replied to any one of the mails that I sent.

My friends have reported the account but still this is not looked into. Hard to find any email or support to contact. I lost my trust in instagram. I think it only does for the main people who run this platform like actors, famous reelers, influencers. They are so quick to resolve their issues. Really very upset.",1
Worst update ever .... recently I updated the app (aug 2022) which has lots of bugs and malfunctions ....when I open a any reel it show the different reel and while scrolling it can show few feeds & reels then stopped I can't scroll further... Team please look into this.,1

I seriously hate this update so much please let the old one back insta won't let me enter my account even though the password is correct but it still says that the password is incorrect or says try again later seriously I hate it,1
After getting a new phone I can not log in. The two factor password does not send me a code. Nor does the video selfie work. This is downright ridiculous üôÑ,1
It hasn't updated my feed in 7 days. I keep see the same story over and over again. It is also the only post I see!!,1
"Instagram please add a feature where we can see who unfollowed us. You have lots of unnecessary updates, why can't you just do this one feature?",1
My only problem regarding insta is why my update comes with a new store section but still no option for attaching music ???:( Please make sure u cover everywhere your already existing (and long time released features) before adding these new things Update 2022: it is mesmerizing how such a popular and heavily used app has such embarassing bugs like no longer showing the text of a pinned location on a posted story. Let s be proffesional and fix these basic issues ok?,1
"I have been waiting for four hours for my page to load, I'm trying to post something I waited for 5 hours and it still hasn't post.. please fix this bug I don't want anyone else to encounter this problem:(. I just hope it would be fixed soon because I'm sending my essay or else I would fail this semester. Thank you..",1
Your stupid app shut down on me and wouldn't let me load into the app so after trying countless ways to fix this I tried to uninstall and reinstall the app and not only would it not let me log it it keeps saying account not found despite friends saying it's still up and on top of that when I try to get my link or my SMS to get my log in fixed I get no message at all making it impossible to get back into my account,1

"Instagram won't let me select multiple photos (or any videos) from my camera roll... it only shows pictures I have already posted. If I click to select from elsewhere, it only allows 1 to be selected. I updated the app and am still having this issue. How do I fix it??",1
Not able to use after every update. It keeps buffering all the time.,1
"Like so many others, I have a black screen when I open the app. I've tried everything to fix it. It's been over a week. This is my most used social media app and it isn't close to as user friendly on the webpage. How has Instagram not fixed this yet!?",1
It's too glitchy. I have been using this app since 8 months but still can't use the latest version of the messenger.,1
I just get a white screen with no way to access anything to fix it. Tried via computer to get in and can't do anything there either. I'd delete my account but even that is impossible because of the white screen. Clearly a software bug with no workarounds.,1
"I'm getting lot's of issues From instgram Like:-whenever I try to upload reels it shows 1) Something when wrong:6 or 9 2) can't mark friends text and reply particular text reply to person 3)I Deleted my Instagram app many times, thought that after delete it will work again normally but No it happening again and againü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ 3) since from last 2/4 months I'm reporting or feedback to Instagram.ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ BUT..

"If you want to solve the black screen problem download parallel space to duplicate the app which will make it work again but you have to use the parallel space app every time, you will need to sign back into it. It sucks that Instagram doesn't work",1

"I really loved Instagram, but now, because of the algorithm that's favoring reels/videos, us artists are just losing our audience. It has been really depressing for us, we have lost motivation. If you wanna post shorts, post them on Tiktok or YouTube, but not on insta.",1
"While watching stories if I don't press anything the next story stucks in buffering until I go to the previous story and than go back to that. Also, today the app is crashing after a few seconds. Instagram is just too bad on Android.",1

Try to clear bugs.....very bad experience after using this app for more than 5 years....Try to focus on its enhancement rather than useless features.,1
"Haven't been able to access Instagram for over 3 weeks now. Seems to be a common issue based on the other reviews. I have done everything possible, reinstalled, removed cache and cookies and even tried on another android phone. It only works on my iPhone which proves that this is an android issue.

I am using Instagram from 2016 and I have 5k followers and those who have just opened their account they are getting more followers . The algorithm very unfair. The team should look after the problem. Not only me facing this problem many of them I know are also facing. I'd - iamsatarupadutta,1
"The amount of glitches is astonishingly high. Instead of changing the overall layout of your app for the fifteenth time this year please focus on fixing the existing bugs and also upgrade your report system because that is a whole other mess. There is an ungodly amount of porn bot accounts running around on an app that's 13+, there's also a ridiculous amount of hackers and scammers too. If you guys want your application to do well you'd stop turning into TikTok and go back to being Instagram.",1
App automatically un-mutes itself after the screen locks. Fix this bug. So annoying.,1

"The application is very bad and delicate, I was following all the people who followed me on my other account and they followed me and out of nowhere they took away my permission to follow. It's been 2 days since I can't follow someone, I hate this app.",1

"I have been seeing a black screen for almost a month, I have tried everything from switching on & off my phone to deleting & reinstalling the app, nothing seems to work. It's pathetic.",1
I dislike how Instagram has evolved. I hate that it now pushes reels so heavily over photos. I hate that creators publish free content and Instagram makes all the money from it. Most of all I hate that I have to export photos from photoshop in a specific format just to appease the Instagram gods. I also really hate that you have to buy ad space if you hope to ever have your shared content seen by anyone.,1
"Worst social media app, I have ever used!! The bugs this app has sucks!! Like the reel won't even play!! Its stucked!! The app crashes automatically!! I can't send a message to a person!! Developers needs to work on this work, This app needs some serious optimization",1
I hate using this app because it doesn't have the option in setting that is 'log out all devices' they this organisation provide this option in upcoming updates i will fell somewhat happy for using this app then the other thing is this app doesn't provide 'two-step verification' this is also a important thing which will help us to manage our accounts easily the final issue is we can't share audio's to our colleagues . I order you to take necessary step regarding this...,1

"I am currently facing an issue of trouble logging in. I have been using the instagram account for past many years and this is the first time something happened like this.

The worst app now after updating it. Why instagram doesn't allow us to know that how many other people have liked the comments on post. What's the problem with instagram.. What's there to hide about it. Is it a secret code or what???? Earlier it was better than now.,1

Instagram does not have any support team available. It is a disgrace and a shame. All other big tech companies have support lines but not Instagram.

Please give me a contact method so I can get my account back.,1

I am slowly losing my patience with this app. Every other day I can't send messages (or in general can't use the app) because instagram thinks there's no internet (which isn't true because in other apps it works). Always have to switch to twitter then (which obviously is not the solution here). And why can't I reply to single messages? I know it works in certain countries so why not everywhere?? PLEASE INSTAGRAM FIX YOUR BUGS INSTEAD OF INTRODUCING US TO NEW STUFF NO ONE IS ASKING FOR.,1

Too many greedy and useless features for one app. Useless updates that don't matter. They take away things we want and add things they think we want.,1

Instagram is bugging too much. I cant login to my another account via apps but it works in the account center.. How come the lite version did better than the main apps lol,1
"Truly an astoundingly bad app considering the amount of money this company has. Every time I try to post a group of pictures, Instagram makes half of them slanty and blurry. In what world does a multibillion dollar corporation not work out a bug that slants and blurs half your photos when you post them? The phrase ""you had one job"" comes to mind. All I want to do is post pictures without them coming out slanted. Garbage.",1
"My account is not been updated with new features like long press for emoji replies, swipe right to reply, change chats colors and all Even after raising the issue in app still no response",1

"Designed to show you what it wants you to see, not what you want to see. Posts are not in chronological order, posts are withheld from your home screen and the app will tell you you've seen everything new. Except you can go to people's pages and see that's not the truth. Scientifically designed to waste your time, show you ads, and make you unhappy. Don't bother, you may as well just go watch ads on a loop.",1

It's automatically keeps me following weird accounts in the past 2 weeks I had to unfollow around 4 account that I didn't search for it or knowing about. Now you can't press the link in the bio.

"Broken and getting worse...seriously? Won't post videos, won't acknowledge photos on device from the past 2 months, and who knows what else you guys have *#%@ed up but I don't know because I haven't tried those actions yet.

Also this bs wanna be tik tok of an app now randomly refreshes making you lose whatever you were looking at once you hit home on your phone to check another app quick. Once you click on Instagram again you better enjoy the last second of seeing whatever it was because Instagram will refresh and make it disappear. FB too because Mark.",1
This app is lika this app is like oxygen for men but there is a one problem that I have seen when I when I edit my story there are some problems or because filter filters are not come that's why sorry,1
"The ads are constant, the creepy fake accounts that follow you, for some reason this app thinks I speak Spanish. This company also catered to a lot of work nonsense. I've actually been actively seeking to delete my account.",1
"First of all, the About This Account feature needs to go for people who don't want their followers or anybody to know where they're from. Secondly, this app is super slow when it comes to posting reels or finding people to tag on your posts and yes it isn't my internet at fault because I don't face such problems while using any other app with the same network connection. Now talking about stories, as an Android user, when I share a reel that is in 1:1 ratio, it gets posted all over the place.",1

Not able to login. it says error. Please try after some moment. So many issues of Instagram in recent days. Please fix this issue.,1
"Instagram has been acting weird for a month or two now. Every two weeks my account is temporarily locked and i have to receive a code to get back in. However, that's not the oroblem. The problem now is that it has happened again but this time for some reason the code is not being sent to my number which is quite literally the only way to get in. So i created a new account to see if the code would send to messages and it did but somehow the SMS is still not sending to my account.",1
First Instagram wants to do a verification of my ph no. & Now it's not sending the code....My ph no. Is perfectly fine and so is my sim... something is severely wrong with Instagram,1
Joke. Got to see a few things. Then couldn't refresh feed. Kept asking to put a mobile number from America in. Tried to find UK or great Britain. Apparently we don't exist.,1
"Just got a Pixel 6a with android 13, and basic functions of app do not work. Cannot post multiple slide show photos on a post, only lets you select a single picture. Also defaults to the gallery of pictures you've already posted and not your photo album from camera.",1
It happened twice now that I can't logged on my IG without connecting both on Meta. I don't like it. Will change rating when if I have a change if heart.,1
Still not working since july 15 update. Showing the instagram loading screen then turns black. July 25 2022 update still getting blank screen only. August 5/6 update still blank screen. Almost a month with this bug/ problem but it seems that they are not planning to fix it. August 10 update still blank screen.,1
"Can't open the app for a little more than a week now, whenever I open it, it just stays stuck on a blank screen. I've tried reinstalling multiple times, updating and joining the beta program. Please fix",1
Have had a bug where I haven't been seeing any new posts for 4 days. Submitted reports of issues but still not fixed.,1
Would love to know why Instagram keeps re-cropping my photos in an awful way. Can't figure out how to fix it.,1
My lawyer had gone through all instagram terms and services and claim that I haven't violated any of it. It was a false deactivation. Please reactivate my Instagram account @amancollection26,1
Constantly has issues creating posts that drag on forever until they are solved and then anotherone pops up... looks like developers arent rcen testing the software,1
I'm highly disappointed. As I'm getting black screen after the splash screen. It been more than 1 month and I have tried every possible way to resolved it but the issue remains the same. I'm not able to use the application.,1
No responses for the problems I reported....my account got suspended without any reason and hasn't recovered yet... I had that for like a few years now and everything gone suddenly.. Instagram needs to fix this asap,1
Whats the wrong with the app? Why should the app automatically decreases the followers with in seconds. Its not working properly.,1
"This app is complete garbage now. Once upon a time, I thought Instagram might fix the very simple visual glitches that started regularly occuring to Everyone a matter of years ago. But hey, why do that, when instead we can desperately try to copy tiktok :)",1
Too many bugs but the one that bugs me the most is the one when I want to post a story with a song but it doesn't let me search up the song I want!! It shows random songs that no one knows and I want Lana Del Rey!!!!! Also it works for my second account which is also on this phone but not my main....? Like what..? Fix it PLEASE.,1
"Every time I try to like a post it says ""try again later we restrict certain activity to protect our community"" this Is very annoying and I no longer want to use Instagram if this problem continues.",1
"Dear instagram team, This app is very good. But after update it worst day by day. It has many bugs and glitch. I face many problems day by day by instagram. 1- When i search my friend username it show that ( user not found) . and my friend said that he did not block me. 2- In story and search option when i search any song it show result not found etc. This type i face many problem please solve all problem as soon as possible. Thank you",1
"I got a warning ONCE from Instagram and now I can't do anything. I've pressed okay, I've re-installed and updated everything but it still won't let me back in. Maybe I banned or something but It's been 5 days and I'm getting pretty tired. Don't waste your time, it's buggy and annoying.",1
"sometimes when i send a photo replay it says ""failed to deliever"" and when i try to type on the photo replay i wont let me type and i have to close the app and open it again",1
"While I feel there is no viable alternative, I hate this app. The rules and algorithm change constantly with no warning or explanation. I dont see the content of the people I choose to follow. And there seems to be an influx of fake accounts while legit people are being kicked off the platform without explanation. It sucks.",1
I logged out of my account and now i am unable to log back in. I have reset my password like more than 5 times and still no luck. Its giving me an Error - There was a problem with your request. Like my password is correct why the hell is it doing this. And there is no support instantly. Its done this to me before and once it just logged me out itself.,1
From last few months i don't know what is the issue but the app se not working properly it's taking too much time for loading anything Even i have complaint this problem but still I'm face the problem,1
"Reels is just an absolutely miserable experience on this terrible app. Glitchy, you lose your drafts that you work hard on and then the finished product, if you're lucky enough for it to upload is of such a poor quality. Awful product.",1
My message swipe option isn't working. And i tried everything to fix it and also i contacted with insta community but still it's not working.,1
So many glitches on my page..... It's so unstable... Sometimes Im not able to see any messeges.. Please fix this as soon as possible...,1
Not willing to give you guys a star but it's not a choice. Well done Instagram well done. A very poor user interface I ever experienced. This is 5th time when Instagram deactivated my account without any email or warning. Not happy with the this decisions. Instagram update your security level. You guys are not doing enough. Upgrade. It's 2022.,1
With all the difficulties I made a reel but instgram gave me only one option that is discard post. Very disappointing.,1
I'm having problems to create my story... There are only a few pictures seen in my gallery when I'm creating story... Don't know why,1
"Instagram is being new porn site, regardless how many times I block these obscene accounts.. it just keep appearing on my feed. Frustrating!! So unsafe",1
"New problem occured , that this instagram changed it's ways , the likes side went up to the messaging area option and some kind of buying centre occured , but it's changing again and again , sometimes it has the old version at night then again the new version during the day , please fix this , thank you ‚ô°",1

I restarted my phone more than 10 times and deleted and redownload the app tried freeing up space in my phone but it is still black screen,1
"Keeps crashing, cant even use the app. Internet is not the problem, i checked multiple times. Pls fix or tell ms how to fix this",1
Nowadays Instagram app is getting hanged. Selected Reels are not getting opened. Kindly check and update.,1
This app is good enough for social media!! But it doesn't have good customer services!! Like why the hell do you have to have to remove the songs which I post on my stories!! And the glitches are worse.. like i mentioned someone nd he/she cannot repost!!,1
"After updating instagram, the reel drafts automatically deleted. When I tried to report this problem again there was some glitch. I don't know what the hell is happening with my account. It's frustrating so much.",1
"My accounts has been suspended without any reason, and its twice, they said dangerous activities, but i don't. Maybe i will stop wasting my time with this useless app",1
Hate this app as there was a small glitch while uploading reels i uninstalled Instagram and re- installed it again... But now there is no feature of reels on my page i can't upload or see reels it has become as it was earlier without reels I don't know Instagram please fix this issue... I m a reel creator i need my reel section back anyhow....,1

I tried uninstalling and installing the app multipe times, i restarted my phone multiple times, and i checked the storage. Please help me fix the problem",1
Continual bugs. Deletes draft reels. Takes a long time to load. Wheel of death a constant. Makes running socials painful.,1
Literally just crashes when you try to add a video. Amazing how mu h Facebook have completely destroyed this app.,1
Zero stars. Blank Screen. The last few weeks when the app opens it's just a blank screen. The web version works but who wants to use it that way. Send a fix.,1
Everytime I open my messages it keeps loading and same happens with my chats. I tried updating still same problem persists.,1
"This app was doing fine but it's been a long while since I can't really log in,after the loading Instagram logo a blank white page appears,I've tried re-installing this app multiple times and none-the-less the problem still exists. What am I supposed to do of it??",1
"When i updated instagram last time, after that neither my story is getting uploaded nor reels video is playing, so my request to stagram team to solve my problem as soon as possible thank you",1
It keeps getting worse and worse! Yesterday u completely deleted my friend's account without warning.. U wiped away her memories and hard work! I was a co admin of that page and we both worked so hard so u can come and ruin it! And yet there are many scammer accounts out there living their lives.. I won't remove my rating until u fix it. Edit : I was completely ignored.. Me and my friend's fan page is still deleted for no reason! My rating will remain the same,1
"Before it was a good app ,but lately a lot of error is happening. I can't even use my chat box and can't post on my timeline.. I tried to uninstall the app and reinstall it but still the same..",1
"Critical bug# Hello team, I don't have replying option, and reacting to message. I checked the user help guide and followed the written steps, but couldn't get the message update option in app. Is this a bug in app or user help guide is not updated. Please look into this issue. After a month I putting this comment. I don't see any update in Instagram messages",1

My feed is constantly crashing and i man not able to see my feed nor my stories .I don't know what is really happening to instagram . My feed stops after 5-6 posts it only shows me 5-6 posts . The new feed layout is actually the worst layout till yet . Please change it as soon as possible . We can see only one post in feed at a time üëéüèªüëéüèª . This is worst update till date . I am having a way more trouble than using any other app..,1
Really bad experience from last 1 month I have been not able to open Instagram whenever I try to open it a blank screen appears and nothing happens i am using Instagram lite and it's not as good as the original app . Many people are facing the same issues i hope it will be solve asap . As I enjoy this app alot i request the developers to seek improvement asap Thanks and regards,1
I'm facing a problem I am getting new followers almost each day and getting the notifications been followed by people but on my profile the followers account is stuck at a number . Please solve this problem as soon as possible then it would be great,1
"Whose dumb idea was it to add vanish mode, or overwhelm the feed with ads. Stupid. Why change something that has been working so well?! Money...",1
"Shopping button and the reels substituted common sense, now it's almost impossible to find a button for uploading a post. Annoying, as if the develors discourage people from using instagram for it's main purpose.",1
Been a while since it becomes white screen and I can't use the app. Already tried everything even uninstalled for few times but to no avail. Already email support center but no response whatsoever. So disappointing.,1
I'm having a big problem and I'm unable to react on Instagram messages i receive from my friends. I hope Instagram support will tell me a solution to that.,1
"Too bad so irritating , they removed me captions and tags from reels and when i want to post pictures and upload new porfile photo they cut half images i dnt know whats the problem in this app",1
"if i could give this app a negative rating i would. its stupid help team isnt existant, and the support phone number leads you to a prerecorded robot voice that refers you to their help website, which is a set of nonspecific lists of things you can do to help yourself. their support email got shut down over a year ago and that leaves you with no way of contacting anyone on the support team. the app is absolutely infested with bots trying to hack your accout. do not let yourself be degraded.",1
Really disappointed after several complaints over the new Instagram notes feature. I still have not got any reply nor the features is made available really disappointed n pathetic service üò°üò°üò°,1
Since the last update my IG has been acting up. What's happening? It's slow. I try to post and it would shut. Now when I want to create a post I don't have access to my photo when hit the create button (+). Whatever is going on please fix it.,1
"It's unbelievable how glitchy it is, and of course submitting reports does nothing. This is really frustrating as a content creator, I can't look at my insights! (keeps crashing). So tired of this, not to mention I miss half of my friends posts because I get so much junk on my feed rather than properly showing who I follow.",1
Message every time I am tagged remains Also it's turned into a TikTok2 with all of the reels. This is not a good thing.,1
Firstly I like instagram most . But now instagram sucks . Instagram just focus only reels . And server data always down . message not sent properly.,1
"Can only select from images that I posted in the last month or so. Otherwise I have to go through my files and select one at a time. Can't even select them directly in my files and share all to an Instagram post, only to my story.",1
"Glitchy app! Often stops working despite updates. Tells me I can't log in & 'Try again later"". Often won't upload videos, no good for business, I need to get things done when I plan, not when the app' manages to function. Insta' bans people for no reason. My 'sis' had been on the platform a few days, hadn't even finished creating her profile, had no followers, sent no messages & was banned. She followed their instructions, sent picture of herself holding a code they sent & they don't respond",1
Most of the audios from my story highlights gone unavailable or it is not getting played. Also the quality of the photos reduces when music or filters are added. Kindly fix the issue.,1
"Very bad experience, I am facing many problems in my account like I don't get swipe reply option in chat and i reported it many times still ny issue is not solved yet. Very very bad experience üëé",1
I don't know what happen but I can only choose 1 photo to post... the only way that I found to post multiple picture at the same time is : you need to post the picture on ig after it's going to be saved in your ig folder and now YOU CAN CHOOSE MORE THAN 1 .... doesn't make sense ...,1
This is terrible I can't even log in to the game this game is so bad I can't even login to the app because all it says is message or then fail I am not a bot I am a real person this app is the worst it doesn't even work it doesn't even work when I go on the website nothing is wrong with my device this app is just horrible,1
"Despite Instagram being a great amount of people's livelihoods these days, it still seems to have too many bugs to actually be functional sadly. I've been having issues for months now. At the moment the app closes whenever I open messages which really effects customers/ income",1
"The feature ""update massaging"" is not appearing on my device although it is eligible for the update and the update is available in my area. Please fix it...",1
Worst Instagram if you like one photo they didn't receive like is showing try again later this worst website.i complete customer care but didn't respond,1
I think nowadays Instagram become worse ! It's doesn't work when we not update the Instagram .. if got update also it's not working properly .. and also stories are banned automatically .. I didn't put anything innaprioate I just posted songs but it's block my own stories .. I need some changes in Instagram if not will report this app soon !,1
It's been days since IG stopped working for me!! I can't even login like FOR REALS! I've been using IG lite since then and tbh it's not that good when posting my stories üò≠ I just logout for like 10 minutes and since then I can't login back like I've been using IG for 4 years now and since the new updates it's been kinda slow ngl. I just hope that it will get fixed and fast! I've been reinstalling and shutting down my phone for these past few days and nothing worked hoping that this get fixed.,1
Worst app to use. It's Showing couldn't refresh feed from 15 days and there is no way to resolve this. Very shameful performace of the app and organization,1
"What's the use of the bell notifications for the accounts we want to get notified of when they never work??!!! I have my notifications on all of the time but I never receive them. Instead, I get the most useless notification ""check out Instagram's latest post."" I DON'T CARE ABOUT INSTAGRAM'S LATEST POST!!! I WANT TO SEE THE POSTS OF THE ACCOUNTS I WANT!",1
Awful glitch. I just suddenly lost my whole account to a 'suspension' with no explanation as have so many people. My whole account is just gone and wiped?! Instagram better sort this out and give back these account.,1
Unable to share the reels on the story it appears as a post.. please check this latest update and also In DM I am unable to reach on particular message..,1
"So many glitches. So many bugs. Does not work smoothly you have to improve the Instagram . Does not feel like smoothly part of the organisation. Instead of adding useless feature, the technology should be improved üò°",1
"My Instagram application isn't working at all. I once uninstalled it and later when I installed it again, all it gives me is a black screen whenever I open the app. I have tried installing and uninstalling it again and again but to no avail. I wonder what is the issue with it. Could you please fix this for me?",1
"After using this app near about 3 years , l am notified that we suspend your account because of they can't confirm my account. And say me to wait 1 months. Why??????? Even no nessery code is not given to me . I tried to get a code not one time , thousand times , still I can't get . It's service is very low , shameful üòï",1
Every third post is a video you didn't ask for from someone you don't follow. Instagram is forcing their algorithm down your throats. If the app is going to force engagement like this they don't need users to actually navigate or open it. Let it run itself. RIP to what was a decent social media platform. It's an automated advertisement at this point. I give it maybe two more years.,1
It isn't working properly for me first it was okay but now I have to reinstall it every other day because it closes immediately after I open it.. please fix this bug,1
Love the app! Really do! But it's so racist. Won't let me and my friend have 2hr streak every 30mins or less it will automatically hang up without one of us pressing the hang up button and it's just not ok.,1
"Y'all should add 0 stars üòî So annoying how i was going to post s story on friends only and all sudden I had to add people to it when I already had them added and when it took me to add people i had because it removed them for some reason, it was loading and loading and my phone froze after it ( no it's not my wifi nor data it's all good and neither was it my phone whixh has been working well) It started to lag after that I also restarted the app and tried do the story again but same happened",1
I didn't received any notification on insta either it's related to msgs Or any other... And i face difficulty... Plz fix this bugs as soon as possible...,1
App crashes everytime I'm viewing stories. Get through maybe 5 peoples stories then it crashes. Also the suggested posts are total BS.,1
DO YOU KNOW HOW ANNOYING IT IS TO OPEN THE APP AND SEE A POST RELEVANT TO YOU ONLY FOR THE APP TO AUTOMATICALLY REFRESH WHICH YOU DIDN'T ASK IT TO AND THEN LOSE THE POST THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT. I CAN REFRESH I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. PLEASE LEAVE ME TO MY OWN WILES.,1
"Latest update has caused the app to be unable to locate my photos in the gallery on my phone. Instead of the gallery, it is showing photos I've already posted to Instagram, making the app useless for those of us who still post photos (the original intent of the app).",1
"After the new update I can't look at a majority of stores. Without touching anything Instagram will zoom right through every slide unless theres a video. Please please fix this, I use Instagram for the stories of friends and artists I tollow",1

Very bad experience. I am not able to swipe to reply message. Can't add reactions. I was not able to report. So bad experience,1
After the latest update I cannot see themes in chats.I cannot reply to a particular message and I only have the like button option. Roll back this update!,1
"Please stop suggestions of people in between Stories, we end following unknown people by mistake, Probably the worst home feed algorithm, can't even see latest post by scrolling down, miss multiple post because of it.",1
"I really don't at all follow why some things in the UI change. For instance when u click the share button it used to just bring up a list of accounts u regularly interact with (I believe based on recents) but they changed it for some reason to now bring up Facebook friends? And at least in my case none of those people I talk to regularly üòÇ like my wife who I send stuff to all the time didn't make the cut üòÇüòÇ or any of my friends, but my great aunt did üòÇüòÇüòÇ why change something that worked?",1
ive been using Instagram more than a year now and recently I've experienced some bugs??? idk what do you call it but when I want to type/draw something on my story it appears to be somewhat distorted/glitchy. I hope you'll fix this because it has been 2 months since i first experienced it.,1
"Not at all taking care of there bugs and report, i cannot use audio for my reels and been trying to reach the Instagram team since 2 days and have done all the things report, switch my professional account to personal account but nothing seems to work, and Instagram doesn't look at reports of their bugs",1
This is not expected from this app. It's already been 2 months and whenever I open Instagram it shows blank white screen. Please resolve this issue and take this matter into consideration. This is not only in mt case many people are facing the same issue but i don't know why the Instagram is ignoring this issue.,1
"too bad app, without any warning ,directly suspends acnt ...yesterday happend the same , it banned alot of pages without any prior notice ....üòêunban all those pages as soon as possible....",1
"God, THE amount of their desperate attempts at copying TikTok layout is insane. Not only it's weird and obsessively embarrassing, it's also confusing the users.",1
"The user experience in this app has become so frustrating for even the most mundane tasks. For starters, the keyboard when typing a comment has the send key to submit your post. Which is way too close to letters. Oh, and you can't edit comments. Oh, and you can copy/paste that comment to make life easier to re-type it. Also, when I comment on a thread, then I get a notification to read a reply to me, the first half of the comments never show up. So I cannot recall the context of what I said.",1
Well I'm locked out for no reason and I can't get help just the black hole of help that doesn't cover my issue...texts went to my spam folder I didn't see them now I get nothing ...,1
"No chance to share songs from Spotify. Also, too many ads everywhere.",1
"no media is loading for me. it says ""couldn't load. tap to retry"" and it's been days. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it's still not working. and no, it isn't my wifi, other apps are working just fine. please look into the issue. thank you",1
"Hi instagram, why my account have not receive 60 sec story? I've tried so many ways but none of them works. Please fix this problem. It's so annoying",1
I have been locked out of my account for almost a year for what they claim might have been a phishing attempt when I logged into a third party app connected to my IG account. So there was definitely no security issue. My FB email is an old college account that doesn't work anymore so I can't get back into my account without speaking to a real life person which is impossible with tech companies like Meta. Both I and a couple friends dmed FB/IG support about this but no response!,1
"All of a sudden, message tab on my friend's profiles disappeared, I can't even text a public account, it totally disappeared",1
The app is very good but now there is one problem after updating the app the messenger option isn't available I request team Instagram to take a quick look at this problem ü•≤ But you shouldn't give any response üôè,1
"Not working properly!!! Notifications button keeps updating every time I open it, it's either at the top or the bottom. FINALIZE IT. Also the 60-second stories lasted ONE DAY for me. WHY",1
I can't able to see the messages timings.. whenever in chat i swipe right to left it shows profile of that person instead of message timing..,1
"Hard to post a picture. Alot of times, images are cropted. Hard to adjust images.",1
"I hate this damn app more than anything in life, I can't reply to people in messages or use emojis to interact and I can't create an account it always says try again even after I've sent many bots the Instagram team never responds and it's have too many glitches, Even after the continuous update, nothing changes, as if the app maker is doing this to me, only me Damn, I would never have made an app like this in my life. What's the point of updating the app if it doesn't change?",1
"Every single time I save a reel I like, the app crashes???? Also what happened to making reels - it's glitchy now and hardly works. When I try to shake my phone to report a problem I NEVER GET A RESPONSE and it doesn't show up in my settings that I reported something.",1
App stopped working. It won't load the log on screen or anything. Just displays blank white screen. I've submitted a help request to instagram over 2 weeks ago with no response. I think instagram is done. Too frustrating and has not worked since early July.,1
"Unusable now. I follow memepages but all I'm seeing are ads that is essentially pornography on my screen, and it's always the first thing that appears on my feed. Totally unacceptable, and my reports do absolutely nothing. Can't use the app anymore.",1
"Why is Instagram not paying attention? üò° It's been weeks now, that I can't log-in to my Instagram Business account, I'm losing money here. And it seems that Instagram doesn't care, so many other user I've been reporting the same issue but nothing has changed. I'm literally thinking of just leaving the app for good, just because I can't rely on something that's not stable. Just me it's very frustrating.",1
"Why is there a suggested posts tab in my feed? I am not in Instagram to see unknown person's posts, I am here for seeing people I know and talk to. Please remove that from my feed because it's irritating by how endless this tab is. Edit: Without any prior notice of what I did my account got suspected. I am getting really disappointed with Instagram's environment and moderation.",1
I got logout from my account and now I can't login again. It shows just dismis as notification. Please clear the bug,1
Not good My swipe reply and all new features is not working. I reported it to the Instagram team many times but nothing happened. Please fix it,1
"A lot of glitches and bugs please fix, whenever I open any profile and click on there reels section, it shows there every reel but dosent matter whichever reel I click on it plays same 1 or 2 reels, even if I scroll down and then click on another reel it plays the same video again and again, please fix this",1
"Blank screen when I open the app. Everytime I open the app it just show black screen. Samsung s20 phone. Tried uninstalling/reinstalling the app, remove all other apps from phone process, restart phone. Nothing worked. app version - 246.1.0.16.113 Looks like a bug. Fix it please. Facing issues since 2-3 weeks",1
too many glitches i can't stand it any more new update made it worst to fix the problem it should be downloaded multiple times a day and after few hours it still continues,1
"Wrongfully suspended my account today, apparently it's happening to a lot of users. They don't even send an email to let users know there is a glitch and when it will be resolved.",1
"You've made 8000 different types of notifications and all I want is when someone interacts with my stuff and you KEEP ADDING MORE no matter how many times I turn them off. I do not care that random people shared reels. Just stop, it makes your app infinitely terrible to use.",1
"After reinstalling and clearing cache & data multiple times, restarting my phone, (and finally updating) idk how many times over the last 4 days IG still doesn't work for me. It just gives me a white screen or occasionally will load a bit more showing me blank story circles. Please fix this!",1
Soo many buggs mann. Imma list em the ones ive faced 1) someone sends me reel in dm i play it and it takes me to some other reel..i can't play the one sent to me. 2) My deleted stories reappear 3) Ive to like multiple times unless it won't work 4) Sometimes im crafting my stories and all of a sudden the app closes by itself,1
"This app has been crashing for almost a month, everytime I go to my profile page. All software is up to date.",1
The half of the reel stops only music play. And then half the Vedio play. Please fix the bug,1
"Terrible. It asked me to update, so I did. Now the app won't open, I just get a WHITE SCREEN??! I have restarted my phone, cleared my cache, uninstalled, and reinstalled the app, and I cannot get anything but a blank white screen. üòÆ‚Äçüí® It has been like this for w weeks now. No matter what I do, I cannot get the app to open up?!",1
"I still haven't got the ""Add yours "" feature even though my Instagram is all updated been waiting for your team to fix it And I receive my dms notification very late and my internet connection is pretty good",1
My Instagram account was hacked and so far i haven't gotten any support from Instagram . I even tried to do a video selfie verification but when I had to upload it showed error. I really wish Instagram comes up with better solution for people who have been affected like this and better customer care.,1
"My account was compromised even though I didn't do anything. When I click the ‚Äòforgotten password‚Äô button, it goes back to the warning page. Fix this now.",1
So I've been having an issue with my Instagram lately. I installed the app and the second my feed pops up it automatically goes to a message fail screen. It's been really weird and I would like to see this problem get fixed asap.,1
Yesterday I post my notes on Instagram and today i cant even see the notes option but I can see that note on my another account please fix this it really irritates me I have logged in or out too many times I even change password and refresh it but nothing is working,1
Horrible algorithm with out of order posts. I just want a chronological timeline! Latest update does not allow me to select which gallery I pull multiple-image post photos from. It restricts it to only images I previously uploaded in my Instagram folder. What the heck?,1
"Please check the account search functionality, it's not working, never expected this kind of bug from this kind of company, if you can assign me as a tester I can find more then 100+ bugs",1
Almost 6months and inbox issue is still there even after updates that I'm getting every 2nd day. Have to reload/refresh the inbox every time. Gonna uninstall,1
Bad Coz its always have glitches... In making reel...if after making reel i save that in draf tha sound change or become blur... Ans while posting story it shows glitch...plz clear them...plz resolve sound glitches too,1
"After updating the app , i couldn't able to login the app . It's buffering all the time and not even directing to the login page .",1
My experience with Instagram is terrible... I have been trying for a very long time to post reels and so on but the audio I want to use is unavailable... Sort this out asap please... This was a good platform but now it's just gone pathetic.,1
How many times i had to log inn ... Omg its so annoying..... My pages are gone automatically... And the worst part is i cant login again... Its showing error... Lol insta i'm very much dissapointed with u.. üò´,1
It didn't allow me to take pictures using the filters i did lay a complaint and I got no help like I'm so disappointed since it used to work in my old phone,1
"It's currently not possible to upload multiple photos anymore without jumping through hoops, the latest update broke it. I'll just use Firefox instead. You'd think with their endless income, they'd hire some competent app developers.",1
Useless app everytime showing ads. getting from cache even I didn't accept the policy of cache but it showing me every single time ads.If I get morr ads i will report in court now.,1
"Hopeless app cos i dont understand why my present IG a/c can't be use...saying couldnt refresh feed plus ""we'll review ur info n if we can confirm it,you'll be able to request a review in the help center within approximately 24 hrs"". I didnt do any kind of this things .so please kindly operate my a/c back in the system",1
So much glitches Always . Very bad experience in reels edit . Too much frustration while uploading or editing üò°,1
"Awful customer service. My account got locked due to phishing and they won't email me a confirmation code to unlock it. There's no customer service representatives, the help center has nothing on this issue, there's no way to actually contact them without them referring to their help center, which again, has nothing on this issue. I would give zero stars If I could",1
"The Instagram app is completely unusable. It keeps closing. I first tried to fix the problem by clearing the cache and storage, but the problem persisted. I then deleted the app and reinstalled it, but it still does not work.",1
"At first it was fine however in the starting aslo I am unable to get updated features that all my friends were having even after updating like reactingon messages, but it's been 3 months I am unable to use Instagram cause it's not opening it keep showing white screen whenever I open it , I tried everything that I can as a user can do , I even reported my problem but got no response.",1
"Truly truly one of the worst app/ social medias out there, constantly bombarded with reels and pictures by people I don't even follow. Always missing out my friends photos. I don't want another tiktok I just want to see my friend's content again.",1
Instagram is so hard to post on you can't get reels to play and you can't get them to not pause and freeze up or jump I have tried to post a real for hours and it still doesn't work I have reported bugs and it still doesn't work please fix your app!!!,1
"Instagram is completely useless right now. Instagram still has bugs in it that has been there since July 3rd (at least for me). Everytime I've opened Instagram, it shows the logo with the meta thing at the bottom. After that, it just sits at an white screen. I have been having to use Instagram on Chrome and it's annoying cause I can't add the things that I'll normally add to my story and stuff (Videos, music, avatar, etc.). I couldn't even post me and my friend get our first ribbon for ROTC üò≠",1
"It won't let me login to my account, I've been trying for hours and it keeps giving me error, I tried reinstalling and everything, honestly I'm tired of your bugs and errors, I had to reply to imp texts and stuff which is now delayed. P.s my account is still stuck with insta direct, I can't even use themes or text reply because it won't give me any messaging update too. Ruined the app.",1
"Horrible upload UI. It takes 3 hours to select the pictures you want, and you cannot set the scale as you like. Editing a post won't work either, always fails to update. Total failure.",1
I have been trying to log in to my account for a while now but every time I open the app it just shows a black screen and no log in options. Same happened when I tried making a new account from my already existing one. Deleted and reinstalled the app and now I'm logged out of all accounts and still a black screen.,1
"Can't post any reels any more. Started not too long ago. No matter what is tried reels always say ""We're sorry, there was a problem posting your video. Try again later."" Tried again and still same thing. Bummer, I was starting to like the reels thing.",1
"Messages, posts and stories aren't showing up in real-time like they're supposed to. I've had constant trouble the past week or so with messages not being sent/received for hours later, sometimes even until the next day. It is making it very difficult to talk with clients.",1
"Can't even open the app, using a Samsung S10 and the app worked perfectly until a week agoish where now I load the app and it shows the logo followed by a black screen. Reached out to them by email and nothing. Don't waste your time.",1
"Very pathetic app. I am not able to send message to anyone. Every time I do, it shows failed to deliver.I have filled multiple queries and still the problem continues. My app is updated, I have a good internet connection too but Instagram won't let me send any message. Please fix it.",1
After uninstalling and then reinstallation the login page doesn't show up. It's just a blank white screen on opening Instagram. Instagram lite is working fine. Tried many ways- restarting device etc. But nothing worked. Facing this since the past few days. Kindly fix this issue fastley,1
"Used to LOVE Instagram now when I switch between my personal and business pages the latest photos don't show up, then when you search in the ""other"" selection you can only upload 1 instead of 10. Why would you change something that was working great?",1
Unable to add multiple photos let alone find the most recent ones from my gallery on my phone. Haven't been able to do this for weeks so just not bothering to use it. And I am so over every second post being an ad for something.,1
"I hate the updated version of Instagram because everytime I'm posting a story in ig the stickers, and text are suddenly having an annoying color, it's crashing. Please fix it, it's ruining the quality of pictures :)",1
"The app still makes everything change colors, Every time I try to post it only shows one picture, etc. So many bugs can we please do something about this. I'm a entertainer trying to promote my channel, but due to circumstances that are out of my control I am unable to make any progress. Please help?",1
Recently my Instagram stopped and not working properly. Whenever I open the app it closes. I can't even report it. It's so disturbing and irritating. I redownloaded the app then changed the password but still not working.,1
"The latest updates are very bad and it does not hide the views of the rails when I hide the views and likes, and also the appearance of my rails in the explorer is weak It got worse to worse when you changed all the posts to Rails. There are post videos. It became Rails. I don't like it. So, go back to the old update.",1
"Hi! I just wanna know why can't I open my Instagram application after I changed my password and logged it out. Like I literally cannot login again, I cannot even open it. Please fix this issue right now. I tried to uninstalled several times and installed it again and again but no use. I also tried to restart my phone many times hoping it'll work but ended up the same. I want to open my Instagram application again. Please how can I fix this?",1
"Instagram what is this?!!! all the filters that i saved suddenly vanished, when I'm going to turned on my data then when i go to ig I'm shocks co'z all the filters I saved is already gone/vanished this is not happened at once but twice or more, I'm so dissapointed on this app. Please fix this, if this app continue like this I'm gonna delete this. Please I really love this app before so please I hope you'll back the filters that i've saved I just can't believed.",1
"Since the last update I cant access any of my folders when trying to upload multiple photos to a post, except the 'Instagram' folder which only contains the photos I have already uploaded! Meta need to sort this ASAP as the app is now unusable.",1
"The soul of this app died a very long time ago. You are constantly spammed by reels from people you don't know, and rarely see posts from people you actually follow. Worst of all, there's no way to turn off the autoplay, so I hope you have lots of data.",1
Uploading and editing photos is RIDICULOUSLY tedious. It glitches out and crashes repeatedly. I can't count the number of times I just gave up posting out of frustration. It's a mess.,1
"This app is a headache now.. It's around 10 days since I'm just seeing blank screen whenever I open it. Feed's not loading, messages not working. Tried everything possible to fix it but nothing worked. Resolve this issue ASAP. it's very frustrating now.",1
"The app crashes all the time since the latest update, and there is no response from the support. It's unreliable and very slow (i have good WiFi connection) and the constant crashes making it useless.",1
"The app was working really well until about 15 minutes ago at the time of this review, Instagram logged me out of my account without warning. Theyve said that it's been suspended and i have 30 days to appeal it until my account is disabled forever. I've tried every possible strategy that I can think of to log back in but nothing's worked. This has never happened before and I've been using this app on and off for 10 years.",1
"Ever since the new update, I cannot copy the link for a story, and was instead prompted to use the ""Send"" button. The send button only allows you to send to other Instagram users, and there's no other share options like we used to have",1
I don't what is wrong with the app bht it is showing nathing except a white screen l cloned the app after trying for a week and hoping that the problem would fix.now i don't have a save button for music so many guitches. I hope they ane fixed. Really frustrating if one is operating a professional account.,1
I don't know what is happening now. but when I open my Instagram the screen goes blank. I already reinstall it many times and it still same. also I alr send email to the instagram support but until now I haven't received anything. it's alr 2 or 3 weeks I send the email. I alr send it 3 times. it so annoying.,1
"The app stopped working, I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it so many times now. Can we fix the problem, I enjoy the app way more than looking at it thru the internet browser! I'm only giving it a one star because it worked fine now it does nothing but a white screen when I open it.",1
"went from an art/photography sharing app to a wanna-be TikTok. Algorithm only cares about video content. Just use TikTok, all the videos come from there anyway... Locking features behind stupid things like having 10k followers or simply being on Android. There isnt even an option to stop the notifications for other people's reels.",1
"After my app not working for what felt like months I finally updated it and now every time I watch one video the app doesn't force close but I can't scroll to do anything else. Why can't Instagram just be for photos like it used to be, you clearly can't handle the video function of the app.",1
"What's the glitch in Instagram. Its not working, I am trying to open & use but unfortunately it close automatically. Neither showing chat list nor reels. Anybody is there who can listening my problem. Anybody is there in your team who fix this technical issue. Otherwise it will be deleted from so many phones today.",1
"I logged out of my account because it wouldn't let me add another account and now when I try to log back in; the app has stopped working. It will go straight to a white blank screen and nothing loads but works no problem on web browser. I've uninstalled, cleared cache etc. and no luck.",1
"New swipe to send feature basically means half the time you want to scroll nothing happens completely redundant as there is litteraly a send button on every picture, completely useless a gets me so vexed when it happens I just leave the app they must be pissing so many people off with this edit they got rid of it hahaha but now the app heats my phone up like crazy better than with that feature tho",1
"Not sure what the deal is, but I went to post a couple pictures I took this morning and it's only giving me the option of choosing from like maybe 25 pictures that I took over a month ago. So fix your glitch or there's no point in me having this to share stuff....",1
"Have been having horrendous problems with uplllload quality on my main account. Uploading the picture from anotber account (but same device) shows a crisp image, while uploading it on my main account just leaves me with a very cadly compressed one that is highly pixelated. This is absolutely unacceptable and i fairly dont understand how this kind of problem can occur.",1
"Absolutely atrocious in help for hacked accounts. Even when you exhaust all means to try to get the account back and you report the account being impersonating you, Instagram just sends a generic message saying there's high volume of reports so they won't do anything about it. It's honestly sad because it was all going well before and I've had this apps for years.",1
"White screen appears when trying to log in to account. Tried to uninstall and re-install multiple times, restart phone, etc. but nothing worked. Haven't been able to access it for half a month now.",1
"I m using Instagram more than 5 years but never get any fault like now. It's been a month while I open my Instagram app it came like a blank page only. Everyday I uninstalling, clearing data but the same problem for each and every time. I can't used it since last month . Make sure tht it will work properly as before.",1
"The app has not been working correctly lately. It loaded my videos UPSIDE-DOWN several times even after I deleted and reloaded. I get ""Can not block this account, please try again."" notice every time I try to block an account. I cleaned my cache, didn't help.",1
**edited** keeps crashing with recent update ************************************************** I like the new update where you can switch to only see people you follow and choose favorites that take priority. I'd like to be able to respond to messages with other emojis like some people can and crop video for stories.,1
"I gave a two star rating in 2019 and it's only gotten worse since then. They are trying too hard to copy other popular social media, and doing it poorly. I don't care about reels, stories, curated content. If I wanted to see that junk I'd go use those apps. Just show me posts from accounts I follow, in chronological order. Currently I only open it once every couple weeks to view DMs and catch up on posts from a few specific people. And somehow that still feels like too much.",1
As others have said the newest app update or whatever it did has blocked me from accessing any of my recent pictures. I'm only seeing pictures from a few years back and it is only like 15 pictures. I have to share my picture directly from my gallery app and if I try to select more than one it forces me to post as a story. I just want to be able to post my stuff like before.,1
"I would like to be able to schedule posts from the Instagram app, without having to have a Facebook account. also, my draft story disappeared shortly after making it, which is very frustrating.",1
Decides to unistall the whole app for a month to see if it would work and to take a break from it. Still have the same problem the whole screen turns white and stays there. Not what I expected.,1
"What happened to access to the gallery?! After this last update, I have to dig to get to my gallery AND I can't select multiple photos or videos. My small business relies on exposure from IG (I know, eggs all in one basket and what-not.... that will definitely change if this isn't remedied soon).",1
"Deactivated my account for a break, got a new phone and lost my authentication codes so I couldn't log on. Tried to contact Instagram no response, try to do a video verification and won't upload. Absolutely useless. I did receive an email to say my account has been blocked for not following guidelines but I've not been on my account and the pictures are just of my travels.",1
"I have had Instagram for years. I have an old account I can no longer access due to losing the email. No matter how Mny times I contact them they can't help. Also lately as of 9/25/22 I can't upload new photos. I have pictures from a wedding I wanted to upload and ""unable to load image"" one evey since one of my photos no matter where they were from.",1
"My Instagram is not opening. It shows a black screen, i tried everything.. reinstalled the app multiple times , cleared the data .. Nothing worked. It doesnt even show me the log in or sign up page as i open Instagram i see the logo and the screen goes blank. Very disappointed fix this problem soon.",1
"The app shut down uncontrollably and I have been trying to find out the cause but I discovered that it is the app, therefore, I uninstalled it then reinstalled again on my phone, after I reinstalled it, to open the App become a big problem. The App has eventually refused to open after I reinstalled it and it is frustrating.",1
"Up until the last 3 or so updates, it's just so awkwardly shameful that an app bought by Zucc is so catastrophocally managed. App crashes. Posts won't load. And as of latest, my follower/following counters are off the rails broken. I get follows pretty often during the day and they don't show up. Zucc shouldn't have meddled in this business, since we very well know how badly Meta manages photo quality on FB. Terribly disappointed. It's my most used app, and a huge disappointment as of lately.",1
"The newest posting format is borderline unusable! It glitches when you try to ajust your photos or zoom them in, and destroys the quality if you want to select multiple...Its horrible, the last format worked much better. Change it back",1
All the features are good except that We can't post a full picture everytime we have to cut and specially when there is a landscape it would not be the same as it was because it would be cut. Improvement required,1
The new update is a total mishap! The app is not working. After using for 5mins the feed or story are not getting loaded neither getting updated!! This is continuing for hours. The chat box is also not working neither messages are getting delivered! FIX THE BUGS ASAP. This is annoying.,1
"No thumbnails for reels added to collection. If u want to view saved reel in a collection, there isn't a way to view them. We have to go through entire collection. When viewed as list - u can't select a particular reel to view. @team - Please look into this",1
"It's totally blank, i tried thousands of time to open it but it didn‚Äôt start. Even tho i uninstalled it many times and again installed it but still there is no progress. Why Instagram has become like this now days it‚Äôs frustrating. I've been using this since 2015 that time this app was amazing but now It's more like trash :(",1
Your app has become SO BAD I've got a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra and STILL have issues trying to edit a video without it crashing 100 times. Maybe put some focus into looking at how bad all these reviews are and the gave they're all consistent should point you in the right direction.,1
"Zero stars for the endless bombardment of ads. My feed is nothing but ads. I'm deleting this and going back to the website. My browser will block them and all trackers. If I was even remotely interested in the grifters, I'd seek them out myself. I don't need it shoved down my throat daily. I didn't install your app to be bombarded by companies desperate for business...they're desperate for business for a reason. Your refusal to be transparent about updates means something to hide.",1
I loved using Instagram until recently. I use it for business and now spend more of my time trying to get it to work than actually creating content. It just keeps hanging with an endlessly spinning wheel. If I uninstall and reinstall it I can use it once before it stops working again. What's going on??,1
"No matter what I do, I remain invisible on this app. The reels that I upload are never noticed. I only came back because I felt a small obligation, but the app really doesn't help me reach / connect with anybody. Now, I can't even get my feed to load, nor my followers and who I'm following. I can see my own posts, and look things up, though. It keeps acting like every visit is my first, and it's annoying.",1
"whenever I click on the app, all that shows up is a blank, white screen. I cleared cache, data, and I powered off my phone and powered it on again but it still didn't go away. i know that im not the only one who has this problem. also, it works on my laptop but not on my phone (samsung galaxy a20e).",1
"the feed got bad. Facebook algorithm was probably added in so feed is heavily repeative with meaningless posts like someone pouring dye in water nd not explain anything. filled with spam posts. bots. and ad filled stuff. even if I re fresh a feed, the same boring posts show up in order. I don't like random accounts I don't follow mixed with the people I do follow. keep them separated, however I do enjoy when ur done seeing new posts nd it starts to show you new accounts. fix the algorithm.",1
ONLY 1 STAR. REASON : I cant reply to an message in instagram messenger chat. Its so annoying when my friends can reply back to my message and I can't do tge same. I can send reply on instagram lite app but not on instagram app,1
"Pleaseeee Helppppp!!! My reel Audio is Unavaiable, i cannot do anything, its just makes my reel looks weird without the Audio.. Instagram needs to give us the option to ""Edit the Reels Audio"" even the video have been uploaded... Pleaseeee do our request!! Thanks.",1
"I don't understand why it's have issues when I'm trying to upload reel video which is recorded in this device or other I'm facing same issue everytime...did lot's of things update app, login, log out but this problem is not solved...also when I'm putting any video on Instagram story it only takes first 15second video story and remaining part didn't upload it show uploading failed retry...but after retry it shows same...",1
What the hell is wrong with reels. Some part of reels getting deleted automatically while editing. I literally don't understand what the heck is wrong with instgram. Try to fix it soon. It's very irritating. And this problem is with my account only.. why????,1
"There are two issues I want to address, first is that the app doesn't open.It shows a white blank screen and gets hung up there. It does reload even after waiting for 2 mins. Second is that it does not allow me to follow people, this bug is going on for 2 days.I have even reported it but still no changes yet.My username is dootoonfts.",1
"I have reinstalled the app but it's not working , it's just white blank page. I don't wanna give it even half a star Hey guys I had blank screen and cudnt get past this until I went to the files folder on my phone today and deleted the I instagram apk folder those are the previous downloaded settings, no need to delete any photos or videos just the installed settings and post that install instagram again it works.",1
Pleasse add option to change music after posting a reel if copyright is going to be such an issue for instagram to deliver it for creating a reel long term. Again reels experience wastes so much time it becomes the exact opposite of what a creator needs. Reposting work makes us all look silly...,1
"This app is getting ridiculous. It can't be possible that the first post shown in the timeline is a sponsored add. I just can't cope with this nonsense. I get 2 posts from my following and then all the other posts are suggestions and reels. I don't want to. I just want to see the people I follow, there is a reason why I follow them and not the ones you keep suggesting.",1
"I couldn't get into the app . When I opened the app it shows a blank screen. I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times,also tried after 1-2 weeks but it is shown as the same. It was a great app but I have this problem now",1
Generally this app is amazing. But after a period of time I have started getting some bugs in this app. The most irritating one is my instagram does not open. All it gets is white screen. I am a daily user with 2hrs of average watching per day. So i request instagram to fix this problem as soon as possible üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.,1
"My instagram hasnt been working for a long time now. Every time i go to open the app it just loads onto a blank screen. I have tried everything to get it to work like uninstalling, updating, clearing its data and catche, leaving it uninstalled for a week or so but nothing seems to work. Help?",1
"Hi, the error ""sorry there was a problem with your request"" is coming when I try to login. I was trying to login on phone but it's not working. My other account is no problem, I can login. I was changing password successfully, was deleting the app and installing new, was clearing data, was trying with Wifi and with mobile data. Nothing was working. Always the same error when I try to login. Do you have Idea what can solve this problem? Please solve this issue",1
"Instagram Won't Load My Whole Photo Gallery :( When I go to post, it only shows a few random photos in my gallery and I can't post multiple photos when I can't access my whole photo gallery. Multiple people are reporting this on social media and Instagram isn't addressing this glitch or answering the help requests, I'm not sure what to do. Instagram please fix this glitch!!",1
I am facing a problem since 4 to 5 months .. that there's a bug or something on my Instagram account that doesn't work properly and also i don't even upload stories or put a display picture because of it doesn't show me recent photos to put on it . I am tired of it now i have reported this problem many times but there's no response from insta team they didn't fix my issue. iam really sick of this now if u can't fix it then delete this application from Play Store and throw it in a trash bin.,1
It's been fine using insta before their recent update. Now pictures aren't loading and the home page or any other pages like reels or even my profile aren't refreshing. I've tried restarting and re-installing Instagram but it still isn't fixed.,1
"I'm not sure about others but I have problem uploading pictures from my camera roll, can't see the option now ans I have to select others. And worst part, I'm not able to upload multiple pictures in one feed. I thought smth wrong with my phone or smth..",1
You have totally messed up Instagram now where's the feeds gone post can't be done properly you can't resize your pictures properly now can't do multiple pictures when posting because you can't edit each one separately to get the best put it back so it was how ever did this once sacking and it was all working so good until you messed it up,1
"I've seen an absurd amount of people mentioning this but after the latest update, a large portion of my photos will not show up. I try the ""Other..."" option but then I can't post multiple pictures. This is just getting ridiculous at this point",1
While posting story i was searching for songs but it shows no result found also unable to use reels audio every time it shows orginal audio not available. I don't know what kind of bug is this i raised complaint so many times but still they are not fixing this..,1
My account was disabled. They said that I violated it's policy. But I did nothing. I didn't violate anything. Now theyre not recovering my account. This app doesn't even have a live chat with its support. They mistakenly disabled my account. But now they're not recovering it. When I try to login they say that they've sent a code to my mobile number but they've not. There is an option for resend code. I clicked it many times but nothing happened now it's been 3 days and I want my account back.,1
"Instagram is popular and part of the it's even more famous parent company, Facebook. With this day and age being the way it is, the security requirements are ridiculous. Tried signing up but you can't do so WITHOUT turning off VPN, which is fine for them but not good for the average person seeking to secure their online data. If they take personal security over their concern with spammers and such, screw them. There are a bunch of other social media platforms out there.",1
This is the second time that instagram flags or reports my story for copyright infringment. I'm sorry how is posting about my work and editting the video with a song that your app always me to put into the video intellectual property infringment and the worst things is that your stupid links are absolutley no help it doesn't have any information thatbis helpful. If the only reason my posts or storys get reported because i use the feature that your app provides to add music then take it off!!!!!,1
0 stars... I've tried multiple different ways to get this to work. It was just fine then I had to delete and reinstall and ever since then... white screen. Really ridiculous given how much financial backing this app has and it takes them this long to resolve an issue... guess I'm off IG for a while...,1
"It has been a disaster for the last couple years. The algorithm is beyond useless now.. first Instagram is so good to use now its a garbage and money making app.. and also there is one bug in stories which is unknown viewers like porn page view stories in Instagram. Please look into this ASAP I have already mail the same issue to Instagram team, but still there is no reply.",1
What's happening with this app? Haven't been able to open Instagram at all. Shows a black screen every single time. I reinstalled it many times. Nothing works. Very frustrating.,1
"Everytime I want to post a story and scroll through my pictures, I don't see all my pictures and vids. Only the latest pictures and vids keep on coming back and overlap the older ones. And also through post; I only see blank pictures where I can choose from. And all these even after the update of the app. Am I the only one?",1
"What's wrong with Instagram. I'm a user from Iran, once you logout from your account it is impossible to come back again. Many are having the same issue for weeks but the glitch has not been dealt with efectivelly as of yet. All I can see is a blank-white screen where you are supposed to choose your account and enter your password. Soo frustrating:((",1
this reels update sucks. the reach is so low because of reels and hiding like and view counts is not possible on reels. it's fine by me if everything's supposed to be posted as a reel as long as i can hide likes. even creator studio is not helping at this point.,1
"I used to really like this app but the more updates there are, the worse the app gets. It takes ages for the feed to update if it does at all. I have a professional account and for a while now my follower count hasnt updated at all. Either there is a problem with instagram or there are so many fake profiles that unfollow/get deleted the second a new person follows. Because gaining and simultaneously losing 100 followers shouldn't be a thing. I dont even know which would be worse.",1
"When I want to set music to my story it never works.When I go to music and search for a song, it always shows searching. I can't even set my post to any music. For this reason I uninstalled and re-installed this app but the same thing is happening again. So fix this problem as soon as possible",1
I'm starting to have trouble when logging in the app. I'm trying to verify through a 2-step verification and was expecting a text message to help me verify but it won't send me a text at all. My phone number never changed so it should send me a text message by now.,1
I've done the most basic troubleshooting methods but I can't login because the app login screen doesn't load! after I open the app it's only a black screen. Instagram lite or older versions of instagram are the only apps that work in my device right now. Please fix it soon.,1
I've been having a bad experience with this app. Videos I watch just pause but the sound's still on. I had to switch to the lite version. Look into this and tell me where the issue is coming from.,1
"Please change the algorithm of this platform. It's so painfully hard for my posts to gain any traction and as a part time artist who's job relies on social media interaction it's completely devastating knowing I, along with many others, will never make a good enough living on this app. Also just a side note: there's a huge issue with bots on this app that post porn. I do not think that is appropriate for the minors on this app.",1
Plzz devlprs fix thisüò† .From last 2-3 weeks i have been facing too many glitches and bug like the app closes automatically many times and it won't show who have seen my stories and even if somebody had followed me or i followed him/her but in notification section shows that i/he/she didn't followed them/me.And the dark mode is so badly optimised that whenever i click on any option it glitches and at some areas it shows black and on another white bcoz of this i can't see the text on that page.,1
"Honestly instagram has gone downhill which absolutely sucks because it is my favourite form of social media. But it's super glitchy now, for some reason I can only ever see suggested posts on my main feed and have to go to my following tab to see posts from people I follow which is ridiculous. My reels are all just random ""Inspirational"" quotes which I hate. They need to stop trying to ""improve"" the app and should have just left it how it was. Everyone liked it back then.",1
"Blank white screen here too like everyone else. First it started when I couldn't add an account to the app getting that white screen, then I uninstalled and reinstalled...big mistake! Now I can't even log in. I've been trying for the past 2 weeks and nothing. Get your act together meta.",1
"Switching phone companies, I know it's just horrible app design. I can't log in again, this time it's because it won't let me choose any other option besides ""can't remember password"" I can remember the password. You won't let me enter it. Worthless. Every day it's a new issue.",1
The app is very good but i don't know what's happening from a month whenever i open the app the screen just turns white and stays like that only. I reinstalled it many times but it just keeps happening again and again. Please do something to fix this,1
"I can not use the insights. Every time I try to see various filters like follows, likes, changes the date range the app automatically logs out/shut down. What is the fix for this please as my insights are so critical in my use of the app.",1
I don't know if this is the most recent update that screwed it up but the app currently closes after about 30 seconds of use. I have cleared the cache and force stopped the app but nothing will fix it. Oh and they steal your data and sell it to unknown sources without your consent.,1
"My gallery of photos is gone from being about to choose pictures to share. It only shares my previous Instagram photos. If I share a photo to Instagram, I can post that way, but cannot share multiple pictures to a single post. Please fix this bug and give access back to our camera roll.",1
"your app sucks. of course you can view posts and stories, but upload more than 1 video, no. this app freezes then crashes once i press the next arrow and selected all the videos im going to upload. insta used to be able to upload multiple videos longer than 30s, now it makes my phone act worse than a potato pc.",1
"10/1/22 when I go to post, the app isn't showing all the pictures in my phone's photo gallery, only random ones. It's annoying to have to go the long way to see all of my pictures, then only be able to select one.",1
"I miss when this app was simple, 4x4 pictures, straight to the point, and served one purpose. Now it's an overwhelming piece of trash. Sucks to see it lose its identity and what made it special after all those years.",1
"As a small business owner who values time and timing more than anything and needs to show off his new products on the regular basis i must say that I'm very disappointed, it takes forever to upload a single short Reel and sometimes it gets stock and won't finish the upload. It has nothing to do with my internet connection, trust me. Instagram used to be good üôÅüôÅ",1
Wosre app ever since they coming up with some update. Lately more annoying part is you can't see people we follow like which post. What is the point of this useless app with most annoying update when you can't use existing features. Worse worse worse app. Slowly will be switching to different social media. Had enough of this useless app.,1
"Adult content keeps showing on my feed. I only want to see people I follow. I don't follow pages that post adult content, but suddenly new reels are showing up as the first thing on my feed, and it's always some lady with huge chest or a big butt, and hardly any clothes. Nothing wrong with those things, but I didn't consent to seeing that. And my kids who are usually looking over my shoulder certainly don't need to see sexy pictures. I'm pretty much over Instagram.",1
"I can't even open the app. I keep getting notifications to reinstall the app, clear the cache, and notifications that the app has a bug. I've done everything suggested by your help page and the support page and nothing works",1
"Can't even use this app anymore, like literally can't use it since all I can see is a black screen... Tried clearing cache and still doesn't make any difference, last month I have the same problem until now which has been 2 weeks right now and still counting. Please fix this ASAP it's frustrating üò©",1
"Please fix this common issue! Everytime I install it and then just uninstall it because it shows only black screen. Why instagram lite is working, but original instagram is't working. People use it for speaking with their friends, relationships. But it doesn't work and you are not fixing it. This is so so necessary app. Just FIX IT!!!!",1
"I uploaded a video when an ""artist"" with no account attached to it claimed the audio as theirs, despite having no connection to me, and without any option to take them off or report this. Cant believe this app still refuses to offer actual support.",1
I don't able to login any account to my Instagram. Every time I login then this saw the error and say your I'd is not belong to an account but actually my I'd is fully right but it doesn't login. Please check this problem üôÇ,1
While flipping through videos all I'm getting is videos in foreign languages and Arabic writing. When I hit not interested the video fades out but does not give me the options to indicate why I don't want to see the content and seems to show even more of the same foreign content,1
"Day by Day getting worst. Whenever i make a reel, i can't even search the desired song. Whenever I type anything into the search box it shows ""no records found"". And when I do same thing with my other account it is working fine there. How many times have to report for the same?",1
"Used to enjoy Instagram, but recently it's becoming unusable. Deeply dislike their push to turn it into TikTok; I don't want to be constantly making videos and therefore I post a lot less as my posts are increasingly ignored by the algorithm. It's more and more difficult to see art on IG when all you are shown now is shallow videos. And my feed these days is constantly cluttered with ads and ""recommended posts"" so it's increasingly hard to see work from the people I actually follow.",1
"This was great up untill it starting acting up so I uninstalled it and then reinstalled and then opened my account and all I got was a black screen. I restarted my phone, cleared cache did everything poeple recommend and nothing has worked. Please fix this!!",1
"Very bad experience.i m using this from last 2 weeks it's not responding properly,my friend share with the reals but i anable to open it and i sending massage to my frd. It is nko dilevered as well.plz do need full as early as possible",1
"Possibly the most bug-ridden app. Every update the comments are messed up, sometimes all replies are invisible, comments disappear after you and others make them.",1
"Instagram has juat become a place for countless ads and keeps suggesting irrelevant posts that I have no interests in. Just let me see posts from who I already follow goddammit. At this point I see more ads and posts from accounts I don't follow, really infuriating.",1
"From the last one week I'm having issues in replying to a particular chat , collaboration and there is no add notes showing I have reported several times but my issue is not resolved yet",1
The app is crashing multiple times while trying to use it. Even while just trying to scroll through the feed it crashes. Tried updating it but it still seems to be crashing.,1
"You're app and it's software is nuts, If I stuck in an argue with a random person I can't even say 2 words to them properly without that "" We've seen this comment is similar to other which have been reported "" Wts wrong with you Instagram",1
Unable to send messages unable to see the news feed anything...! Insta is not yet responding and yet working properly,1
It's been weeks and I am still unable to access my account through the app. It just shows a white screen. I have reported it 3 times and have not received any kind of email regarding the issue! When will this be fixed!? I have a personal and business account! I'm currently opening my account through a web browser but there's so little you can do....,1
"I've been doing all I can to get the app to run properly to no avail. Cleared the cache, uninstall/reinstall, restart the phone etc. Etc. But the app just doesn't load any photos/videos or stories for me. Infuriating.",1
Reels crash too much. Disappointing when you use the app a lot for business. Or it's AI thinks you're a bot and restricts your posts.,1
"You're the only social media app I use and the app sucks. I don't like being penalized for adding to many people or liking too many photos at once. App crashes often. Sometimes I can't post stories with out restarting the app. There's no IG support team if something goes wrong. Someone has been impersonating me for a month, many have reported but the page is still up with MY photos the person stole from my page. This app does not have a positive impact on my life.",1
"It's been completely ruining the quality of the pics I try to upload for a few weeks now and the app is set to always upload with the highest quality possible. Please, fix it, this did not happen so much in the past.",1
"Maybe your core code was never meant to be for videos. The video uploading is just too buggy, so poor, that you can see how far this app is from being as good as YouTube or TikTok. And this has been going on for YEARS. I have never seen any significant fixes.",1
"My account is locked and I tried to recover it. The way I chose to recover it is by Instagram to send some code to my mobile number but it won't work. There's no any message at all. My phone number is good, I set the settings by putting all the app permissions on but still no message for code. Please fix this.",1
Very bad... Always has an issue while making reels Again having the same problem Can't upload my reels or photos Why this problem is happening again and again,1
"Which kind of glitch is this ... My one friend is able to send me reels and msgs but whenever i try to react it get failed , whenever i try to check her id it only shows Instagram users",1
Not great! Haven't been able to get into one of my business accounts for months. No way of contacting Imstagram to help rectify this. Which is very annoying especially when you can't raise a ticket without login and I can't login at all.,1
I found glitch in my account whenever I tried to follow someone doing like on someone photo or videos it automatically undo that thing I complain so many times to Instagram team but they didn't anything,1
This app is crashing. Doesn't work on wifi anymore. Runs only on mobile network.,1
Literally I can't even install after the recent update! And it's happening to everyone with the same modal as my device. Please fix this damn issue cause I have to use the lite version which lacks a lot of features. Instagram please!! üò≠,1
"User interface is awful. Never see posts from accounts you follow, only suggested reels. Trying to be tiktok. Instagram had its own market, sharing pictures. It has deviated from its original business model so unbelievably far to try and compete with tiktok. It's disgusting.",1
"No one can see your content unless you make reels, but the reels function is buggy and constantly crashes or posts glitched content when it works at all. This app used to be fun before FB got a hold of it.",1
"I have encountered an unusual problem with my account recently , my whole insta explore page has been refreshed & showing totally irrelevant posts of buildings & photography, i have lost all of my intrest in this app bcz of this glitch , i have tried a lot to reverse the change but all in vain . I have removed hundreds of irrelevant posts by not interested & liked hundreds of posts of my intrest but still no change is there . Fed up of this useless algorithm.",1
Today i opened my Instagram and it automatically logged me out. Now i cannot log back in and it shows on the app that my account no longer exists.,1
"Messages wont appear in chat, saved notification doesnt go away, closing on me when using the app.",1
"You're app is randomly switching back to older versions, not letting me add music to my stories or let's me react emojis to text chat messages :( fix this and you'll get your 5 stars back",1
I don't know why but the app is showing many glitches like when I want to save a reel to my albums I go to myh story nd then I click the three dots but there is no save button as before..plus whenever I open the app it always shows that I got likes in the notifications but when I click it nobody liked anything..and now it's showing everyone that I have deactivated my id when I hadn't..I was facing this problem from many days but at last I thought to give review about it ..plz take serious action,1
"Instagram always happens different kind of bugs. For example, my Instagram account can't refresh the new IG story for me and always show the story that I had seen although I refreshed MANY TIMES!!! In the past, my Instagram account can't repost the post even though the post is created from the author with public account. Instagram always has bugs that so annoying",1
"This app lately just keeps stopping can't look at stories, can't look at messages and just overall been performing buggy",1
Restricted my story and didn't even tell me why. Messages are also bugged and video/audio calls are always glitches one way or another,1
"I have been using it for quite long time but today it Isn't allowing me to post and then aftdr sometimes i post then all my captions are gone if i edit it, it still doesn‚Äôt load PLEASE fix it",1
"Please include a confirmation before deleting a message, ""Are you sure you want to delete this conversation?"" something like that because sometimes i accidentally deleted a message when I'm just supposed to mute the conversation.",1
"Unable to upload reels or stories. It spins and says posting but never posted, even after sitting all night . I uninstall and reinstall , lost the post and repeated the same issue when I tried to post again.... Three weeks of dealing with this issue üòï",1
"I had to use unauthorized external app, compromising my privacy and security, in order to see whom I did requested to follow by mistake, during swiping through insta stories. Some genius decided to put on screen people i might want to follow and other genius decided to remove BASIC OPTION of showing pending follow request!",1
"Doesn't send me dm notifications. Chats delay to load new messages, getting off the app or refreshing doesn't help either.",1
I have not been able to send direct replies in the direct messages.. i looked online and they say i should look for an update messaging option but it doesn't exist. All my friends are able to reply directly to specific messages and i can't. Why is that?,1
"Straight trash. Endless ads, 90% of the content is generated by bots or useless people doing dumb stuff for internet points.",1
"So many glitches I can't follow someone it always shows, we restrict these activities. I can't see my Dm until i refresh and sometimes it shows after 2 days plz fix this problem",1
My account is not working like( couldn't connect relode it) now days I am irritating to use this app please retrieved the problem as soon much possible,1
"After downloading the new version it is running super slow, don't know what's wrong with nothing is working proper storys,reels,post anything everything is down",1
App is good but in the reel section soo much adds there. If they want to show us that much adds then make an option like Spotify primium and the helpline service is the worst of all . Thats why i give only 1star üòë i required u go use the Facebook that's much better than this ig ! That's all i have üôå,1
"8/10/22 - I cannot access one of my accounts. Posts, stories and messages dont pop up. Other accounts I have work fine but that main one. I can even access the help option in settings. Am I missing something? Could something be done to fix that?",1
"My instagram was working good. But once i loged out of my instagram,it went totaly black. And now i have tried uninstalling and installing back multiple times and also i have tired rebooting my phone several times. Still when i open my instagram its still comes out black. Please do updat this bug issue. And you guys keep one changing tge layout. Its really annoying.",1
Locked me out. Flagged my account I actually never use it and refuse to jump through there hoops and verify like a damn bank account.,1
Why instagram....pls fix your problems....that is not working properly....there are so many glitches...and they are annoying....pls fix this .... Today my instagram doesn't work properly there are so may glitches it's so much irritating pls fix this...,1
I have been using this app since a while now.. it's a great app but from past 15 days I have been having a issue.. whenever I am trying to open the app I get a blank black screen instead of the login page.. I have tried several things like rebooting my phone.. uninstalled the app and installed again... but it is not working.. I am really disappointed with instagram. Please check n resolve the issue asap,1
"Like many people mentioned I am also unable to use instagram since last 10-15days. Whenever I open application it shows blank screen. I have sent an email on support id as well as tried other options like clearing cache, reinstalling application,etc. but it just doesn't work.",1
Won't let me stay logged in on more than one device! I log in on one and it logs me out of the other. I log back in on that and it logs me out of the first one. REALLY irritating!,1
Suddenly the notes feature disappeared and we are never getting that feature . I reported so Many times so plz look into this issue,1
There is no option to upload high quality video in android phone üò≠....these option available only in iPhone...so what about android users? This is not fair üò∂...very worst,1
Instagram is not at all working problem and they don't even fix it if we say them too !!! After update the app becomes more poor!!! Not able to make reels as when trying to make it the sound is not coming!!! Kindly fix the problem of Instagram as soon as possible,1
Edit: I was banned shortly after this review. Too many ads and too buggy. It's clear to me that Instagram does not care about its users.,1
"The app is literally becoming from bad to worse, stop making unnecessary changes, PLS I'm begging u. just let the app be as it was before, it was perfectly fine. allow us to change acc while posting smth pls this is so annoying, esp when the posting thing is bugged and it just won't post even though it's been hours. additionally, pls stop turning every video into a reel, it's so unnecessary and irritating, i have to add a pic in order for the post to not turn into a reel so i can hide my likes",1
"First it won't let me post anything without the proper app permissions (it has all permissions, it's just asking for something my phone doesn't have and blocking me from uploading otherwise). And then I backed out of the Beta and tried it that way - now it won't let me post reels anymore. I can't do part of my job now, so that's cool",1
"Recently this app had not been loading my feed as I scroll. I've found that I have to exit out of the app and reopen it multiple times for it to load my whole feed, which is SUPER frustrating when you're trying to go through your feed chronologically",1
"This update is not good enough because posting videos are directly posting it into the reels rather than in video post .while posting in reels the video clarity breaks posting the reels or only video,photo post is our choice give that option so make it happen in the next update ..",1
"The app has become detrimental, as a small business owner, creating advertisements is the soul of the company. Unfortunately this functionality has been disabled, as I can no longer select a payment method, the links are broken. Contacting the support is absolute pain, and inutile, there is no feedback and the problems keep amontuating.",1
"Terrible Algorithm! Show me a subject/topic I hate, don't give me a way to block that topic. Reels showing that topic automatically play, which equates to ""engagement"" which means more of the subject I hate.... Good work!",1
Getting refresh problem from last 4 days. My Internet speed is Excellent still It takes a Lot of time to refresh. After refresh I am not able to watch stories,1
Got logged out and get log back in the code isn't being sent to my sms the app is bugged and has fully gone wrong simply logging out without reason useless,1
In vanish mode automatically screen shots was taking continuously is there was glitch or bug in instagram.,1
"Many posts, almost 95% posts from my followed account never showup. Just filled with posts from 3 to 4 days ago that keep on showing repeatedly, and posts from accounts and hastags that I never followed",1
"Can't delete my account from the app, highly recommend everyone give the app 1 star until they make this change. They make it harder on purpose not because they didn't think about it.",1
"Just TERRIBLE APP, crashing a lot, sometimes I can't even use the app, doesn't open or just closes and I can't do nothing, trash app for real. Edit: Still terrible, but worse bc now I can't even open the app, black screen forever xd",1
I've liked some of Instagrams new features like with stories and message theme colors and the restriction negative comments etc. Why I give Instagram a 1 star üåü review is cause of the bots messaging me or liking my stories without viewing them and yet they'd restricted a message from an important person who I'm following and they're following me etc as if they're saying something until those issues are fixed one star for this and tell people if their accounts are permanently banned etc,1
I added money in my business account but everytime money deducted from account but not received in Instagram account. No money is showing in my account. No contact number is available for Instagram to contact. Very unhappy as i lost my money.,1
It's not a good app it's not working properly it's getting problems not showing reels and etc it is not working properly nowadays I have reported so many times to insta app but there is no changes in the app so it's not a good app,1
I get a single post from a legitimate friend followed by an Amazon survey and thousands of suggested posts. Masterclass in completely ruining an app over the course of 6 years. Bravo.,1
Hi I'm raguna. My account has been hacked although it's a private account. It also contains some sensitive pictures of mine. They are misusing my account and creating many troubles.

So i kindly request you to delete or recover my account as soon as possible. Thank you.,1

"Given the fact that Instagram is filtered in Iran we have no choice but using vpns in order to get connected. This changes in IPs and locations lead to being considered ""suspicious "" by Instagram and our accounts being suspended.

The app keeps crashing randomly recently.i tried ti delete it and redownload it. It keeps crashing again,1
Yeah not being able to post photos onto an app that is literally all photos is pretty frustrating. I don't know what update needs to happen but Android cameras at least mine aren't syncing to Instagram and you can't post pictures rendering the app quite literally useless,1
The reel is really messed up today. I can't post the reel properly. After posting the reel it automatically zooms out and video freezes with music in video continues to play in background. That's not good at all. I tried so times to post the reel. It didn't work and made this experience so worse for me. I had to finally delete the original reel and get the loss of of views. So leaving beta program to finally post the reel. The app is so buggy. I have same problem even after that.,1

Instagram accounts are getting hacked a lot I lost my first account hacked ..... Everything is being removed in the name of updates.... Reel safe option removed Other features removed..... If updates like this keep happening Instagram will just go for reels ..,1
Horrible experience. All over the shop. More ads than posts. Things I'm watching suddenly vanish. Can't watch reels full screen landscape. Reels are unnecessary and covered in clutter. Generally a mess.,1

Hard to select fotos in the right order to create posts with multiple fotos. Reordering is hard with the number system. Hard to select from many many fotos in the Gallery. No adding fotos after posting. I would expect much better useability from such a big player...,1

"Way too much suggested posts and ads. After each post I view, I spend way too much time disabling suggested posts and hiding ads.",1
"I loved it but the new feature... Taking away my ability to see what my bf likes sucks. I'm about to be attacked for being ""insecure"" but I've found out my last two bfs were cheating this way. Ignorance is not bliss.",1

"Experience is becoming more and more buggy. Posting multiple images/vids often goes wrong (crop & filters applied wrong,...) and then I'm not even mentioning the amount of ads that are crammed in between every four posts",1
I see unnecessary posts from people who are not in my network. The whole thing is packed with Ads. Instagram should learn from TikTok because TikTok is way better and fun than Instagram.,1
I have updated Instagram to the latest version still I hav not got the notes update.. I have tried many time re-installing the app but still not able to find the notes update.. My device ONEPLUS 10R 5G,1

App is misbehaving. Music goes on but video freezes ü•∂. Caption and hashtags are not working.,1
"This is the most useless garbage app I've ever used. I haven't used it in a minute, and now it won't let me log in. The only option to log in is to retrieve a code from a defunct email address, with no alternatives. I managed to reactivate that account just for this, but it is not receiving your request. Therefore, useless. POS.",1
"I have live notifications settings turned on in the app, on my phone, and on their profile but I don't get the notifications.",1
The app was going all good then IDK why they removed the 60 sec story option like it was quite easy for us to upload the full reels and videos easily and enjoy them now again back to the same disgusting and another Cons is we only get 15 sec of music in simple story they should Atleast increase it to 30 sec minimum and make the app more easy and convenient to use I wish they solve it,1
I haven't had certain features on my account like guides for a very long time and I never get any help or response when I have reported the problem on the app,1
Instagram why does it shows a green screen when posting a video on ig story I've been experiencing this problem for months now please fix this or give me an explanation why this happens,1

"Feed (both main and chats) are not loading at all. The app is not working at all on my pixel 2 device. Not sure whether it has to do with app's compatibility with my device's OS. If anyone else facing this issue, please let me know.",1
"Cannot see replies to comments anymore. Can't even see the button that says ( view replies). When people reply to my comment, I can reply back through notifications. After thag though, I cannot see any of the replies on original posts. This kinda sucks.",1
I am so tired of the reels function not working. Sounds get removed and you can't go in and edit it so you have to delete a video and redo everything. If you're going to push this function at least make it work right.,1
When I open this app it keeps freezing and crashing my phone. This is only happening when I open Instagram.,1
Cant login my account after turning on 2 factor authenication and lost access to the authenticator app. Tried to follow the on screen instruction to take a selfie video for several times but got email replied that cannot confirm my identity. Really hope there is a better way for instagram to handle this. For now i can just ditch instagram altogether and continue my content creation on tiktok. So long farewell IG!,1
"I now can not post multiple photos in one post which is incredibly frustrating. It's unnecessarily clunky and so many ads and irrelevant hash links that crop up, I feel like I'm constantly getting rid of stuff I haven't asked to see. Fix please.",1
"WTH it's not working at all....not saving story/status not uploading stories,not sending voice messages not sending video... what should I do with this...",1
"Update: chat features suddeny became super basic. Terrible update please undo it! Really buggy experience on Android, right now when I scroll all the videos are so pixelated I can barely see them. Seems to happen every so often on Android.",1
"You need to add options ""hide likes only or hide views only"" since it doesn't make any sense why reels doesn't have views displayed on the feed but instagram videos back then has views displayed on feed",1
"Awful update, I don't want suggested content on my feed - can I get rid of it? 03/08/22 - keeps getting worse, now it doesn't even show me the latest post at the top of the feed, just a random one from the last few days each time I refresh. Dreadful!",1
"Pathetic experience since a week now. App stops working whenever it wants to. Declined to refresh, declines to upload anything, declines to switch accounts, deletes drafts, restricts editing, decreases the quality of videos and what not. Horrible is the word for this new update. I don't what's Instagram and Facebook upto. They are degrading the customer service t and experience to the lowest ever. Horrible Instagram. Please stop updating if that's what you want to come up with.",1
"Please improve the camera aspect for Android which is always bad quality! , this case has been around for a long time and no repairs have ever been carried out! Please fix it, since META took over Apps that are used every day like whatsapp, instagram, facebook, there are more and more bugs and the quality is getting worse! please fix it soon! give a bad effect to the user! üòåüò§ I appeal to META to take immediate action!!!!!",1

"Bad, I signed in today to find I was banned for no reason and now it won't give me a option to fix it, for someone who doesn't do anything but look at stuff on the app, this is not a good action.",1
"Used to love Instagram but recently it's gotten near impossible to use. Every time I try to post it doesn't recognize the literal hundreds of pictures I have, so I physically can't post. I don't know what happened but whatever it is it's horrible. Until this is fixed I will not be able to use the app, and honestly I don't want to. It's obvious that Instagram no longer cares about its users as it is prohibiting people from doing the very thing the app exists for. Would not recommend as of now.",1
"The worst app I've used till date. Always i got irritated whenever i upload a new reel. Even I select a music for it, still when it its uploaded, it shows the music is not available. Wth is wrong with this app",1

"Constant crashing and overall just useless updates. Also blatantly ripped of TikTok for reels, but everyone did.",1
It was all good till today..... today when i updated the app...

I have updated the latest version still haven't got the note feature. Also I'm unable to see people who are online. Please help ASAP,1
I used to like Instagram a lot more than facebook for advertising. I am very limited now with songs I want to use for my reels. It is very frustrating being a small business trying to get good music along with my reels.,1
"1 star for ads , didn't counted how many times I reported ads , still showing the same. Porno, sexually misleading ads , .. never thought Instagram gonna do this things , ü§î money making ideas ...?",1
"Edit3: If you lose access to your phone number, you will lose your account, because as soon as you will get logged out or even temporarily locked for no reason (and that happens often), you will have no other choice but to abandon your account, because there is no way of restoring it. There is even no such thing as customer service anymore. You are simply presented with a ""help center"" that solves none of your problems, and there is no way of contacting a representative that can actually help.",1
"Most recent update broke instagram insights. Every time I try to change the time period to look at, the app crashes. I need this feature for my job, but instagram always finds a way to make the experience worse with each update",1
"App is not opening, it keep showing network error occurred. I have tried all troubleshooting method nothing works yet. Even I uninstalled and reinstalled the app it can't even login after that. I have seen so many review regarding this(same issue I'm facing right now) there is no response from your side. Fix this problem asap.",1
"What has happened with the links in the profiles and stories ? None of them are working for some time. And by this, I mean links on profiles and stories of other users. I have been raising the issue for a while, but no resolution. Also- app is updated, so I don't know what the issue is !",1
"I don't know you want to run your Instagram or not coz of so many Glitches out there, like I have updated the app do everything not to have any glitch but no response I have given one star if the creator should able to give in - minus rating I'll do that so shameful can't worth it's was so worst experience till now",1
I've been using Instagram from 5 years but from past some days it's not working properly.... Sometime nothing appears on screen rather a fully white screen... And if it opens by-chance then I can't react and reply to a particular chat... Also the Theme option fir chats is disappeared... I hope to fix the glitches.,1
"Not loading. I tried all the recommendations: uninstalled and installed, cleared cache, checked the internet, and nothing worked.",1
I used to love Instagram. I got notice that my account has been suspended and I believe that Instagram deleted my account for no reason and I can't even get in to appeal. This app is so irritating.ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨,1
"this app is super glitchy, banning people just for using the app this point. I can't follow people properly for more than 3 weeks. and I've reported it 5 times but not even a single response or reason?! I follow 6k people but limit is 7.5k. updates happen on one account but doesn't happen on others. what is this?! I gave it 5 star once and giving it 1 star now, it has to earn my and others respect or I'm moving to another app. oh and yeah nobody likes notes. it's ugly and useless and annoying.",1
I didn't liked new version where sometimes I'll miss out few posts while scrolling and once you'll complete recent post. It won't show you again untill you'll select ''view older Post''.,1
"Notification been there show someone add you our story, but no someone added. It's only strategy to distracting on busy on their.",1
My account has been hacked I've sent multiple messages to support and no feedback. I've tried all steps to recover my account but the app is bombing out,1
My account has been hacked an I have no way of getting back the person changed a lot of things on my account an is harassing my friends with fake money grabs an Instagram is doing nothing to help get my account back an to make it worse this person has several of my friends accounts an did the same thing an until this resolved I am going to leave at one star I wish I could make it zero stars but ho well,1
"Instagram notes used to work earlier, now they have disappeared again and even after reporting the issue 3 times, no solution has been provided.",1
"how many times do i have to report a problem to get it fixed or at least get a feedback on it? my money is stuck on instagram and i cant even use the ads service, how do i even fix this problem?",1
Not sure if it's a glitch but I can't use Instagram at ALL. Absolutely nothing comes up when I open the app. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that did nothing. I also tried logging in from my computer but it's still just a completly white screen. Does anyone know what's going on?,1
I am facing some issue with my account. I am not able to watch reels and my wifi network is running completely fine @300mbps.,1
"Instagram seems to have lost connection to my photos. Attempting to make any post it does not include any photos taken in the past six days. Internet connection has been checked and is fine, phone restarted, Instagram restarted and no change.",1
Before some days i have facing many problems in this app and now it's too much irritating cos messages which send by which whom I'm chatting and i saw that they send me message and i get it and when I I intered in chat that message was hide from chat so this type of problems happen with my account,1
Report System is really bad. People using my pictures or from friends and Insta support thinks it's not a bad thing that those people pretend to be one of my friend or me.. :),1
Pathetic!!!!!!!! Messages aren't updating. I can't react any other emoji except like. Please fix it. Pleaseeeeeeeee it's damn annoying,1
Wasting time on Instagram now a days they didn't fix anything for better to 2023 they are stuck in old version my follwers didn't counting properly and viwes reach down what are they doing in company fix all prblm with other wise 2023 is bad days to instgram,1
Not good nowadays. Full of bugs and crashes. Cant even upload or forward storys. Getting low views.,1
"My account was suspended for no reason and when I click the button to appeal the decision, I'm direced to a blank page with a loading icon. I can't send any forms via their support page. I can't log into my account. There is absolutely no way of contacting Instagram. They haven't emailed me to tell me what's going on with the account, nothing. I advise everyone to steer clear before investing time growing a community only to have it randomly taken away. This app is an absolute joke.",1
"I've never had a problem with Instagram but yesterday I logged out of my account and when I tried to log in it showed a blank screen. I logged out of my another account too and same thing happened. I've cleared cache,unistalled and installed the app numerous times but it's not working. Fix your bugs",1
Instagram is really not as good as it was...when I have a new follower it doesn't reflect and also I can't repost on my story. Instagram is a very poor and bad application I've been having issues since last week with logging and I have sent emails yet no response and clarity.,1
"Awful - Full of errors and bugs, doesn't show contents to people and is always asking for money to show it to more people, stupid app.",1
The app is completely unlikeable now because of the significant features that suddenly just disappeared after updating. Please bring them back especially the 'copy link' option for stories! Bring the app back to what it is before.,1
"The amount of times this app automatically refreshes the feed for absolutely no reason is infuriating. ""I see you're in the middle of reading that post. Here's a completely different one. Good luck finding the other again.""",1
I was facing some glitches from past few days after 5 minute the search bar dissappear and same reels playing continously after refreshing nothing happen.,1
Instagram auto scrolling and refreshing is the worst feature ever. And they just keep making worse and worse features that gets in the way of people browsing. Video playing also freezes a lot of the time for lots of people and hasn't been fixed by the dev,1
This app sucks. The bugs haven't been fixed. I can't edit or post photos with out it glitching or crashing. There's no point this app if you can't upload your photos. Update 8.4.22 This app still sucks. Same issues with no solution.,1
"Messages are taking forever to send, can't refresh feed, and can't post, while all my other apps are working flawlessly. Like dude my entire life, all my memories and messages, are on this app and now it's down and won't let me do anything. Get it together, Please.",1
"Everyday a new bug. Now IG has turned into it's old version for me with no reels, no chat react etc. Yes, I'm using the latest official version.",1
"So many people have talked about how after it shows the ""Instagram: By Meta"" it just turns to a black screen. And they tried everything to fix it. I'm one of those people's. I emailed you guys too, so please. Please hurry up and fix the app. I love this app when it let's me use it.",1
"I am soooo annoyed. I have not been able to access Instagram from the app for weeks now. All I get is a blacked out screen. I have deleted the app, reset my phone, reinstalled the app and more plenty of times no changes üò´. Please fix this inconvenience",1
"I love the app but ever since I downloaded the latest version,,,,it logged me out and always telling me that my username doesn't exist ,,,,yet I can successfully log in using other devices üòí‚ò†Ô∏è",1

Last update for android is not allowing for voice notes to be played and listened to by the recipient. Patch it up please!,1
"It forces you to share a reel when you are sharing a video; and when you finally get sick of it and try to share your video as a reel, the quality becomes so bad that you can count the pixels. Also, what is up with the ratio options? It's 2022!",1
Don't like the new format. Mixing recent and older posts is a waste of time. Plus I'm missing posts I want to see. Why change something good for bad ?!,1
"Not only do I only see a fraction of the posts from accounts I follow but posts tend to magically disappear in front of my eyes. Lastly, don't spam ""suggested posts"" in between posts from followed accounts. There is a for you page and space after my feed.",1
Terrible. Took away my business accounts I've had for years. Without any solid reason showing I violated policies or fixing supposed issues. Never ever using Instagram again.,1
What's hell is happening with Instagram. It's getting pathetic day by day. I am not able to see my draft. I am not able to see viewers on my story. I am not able to login another account. Now I just Uninstalled Instagram. But now I am installing again and trying to login but it's not login. It's just blank. Kindly please resolve this issue otherwise users will stop using this.,1
I can't use with app without it crashing. I made a post literally an hour ago and the app was working perfectly. I've un-installed and re-installed the app multiple times but it keeps crashing.,1
"Editing this a year later and instagram is worse than everüíÄ my reels dont work anymore and i cant even send a picture or a video without it being ""sent"" for literal hours.",1
"The most buggy app I've ever used. I've had to delete and reinstall it twice now, and every 2 minutes I have to restart the app, and every 10 minutes I have to restart my phone. They better fix it.",1
"Every time I open Instagram and goes to the chat section it keeps closing automatically and coming to home screen . Why is this happening, is this a bug idk. I reinstalled the app but there is no change in the bug. Please fix this bug immediately.",1

Horrible application. They randomly decided to disable my account for no obvious reasons and there is no way I can contact or get in touch with them. I have been trying to log in and try all the troubleshooting but all in vain.,1
"I been using this app for how many years however lately this app won't work. Whenever i tried to use the app, it won't work all i can see is a black screen. I tried to clear cache, clear data, uninstall and install the app however it's still the same.",1
"""Photo can't be posted"" two times in a row. I already updated the IG App and it's still not letting me posts my drafts.",1
The new update of the notes is still not working on my account but it works on my other accounts and I've sent you emails and reports and emails from about two weeks but never got a response.,1
"I'm not a fan so far. I find the format inflexible and I'm unable to share links. Honestly, I prefer Facebook.",1
